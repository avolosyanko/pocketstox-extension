BUSINESS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)\nIntroduction\nNewmont Corporation was incorporated in 1921 and is primarily a gold producer with significant operations and/or assets in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Ecuador, Fiji and Ghana. At December 31, 2024, Newmont had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 134.1 million ounces, attributable measured and indicated gold resources of 99.4 million ounces, attributable inferred gold resources of 70.6 million ounces, and an aggregate land position of approximately 25,500 square miles (66,000 square kilometers). Newmont is also engaged in the production of copper, silver, lead, and zinc. As the world’s leading gold company, Newmont remains committed to creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining. \nNewmont’s corporate headquarters are in Denver, Colorado, U.S. In this report, “Newmont,” the “Company,” “our,” and “we” refer to Newmont Corporation together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nOn November 6, 2023, we completed the acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited (\"Newcrest\") (“the Newcrest transaction”). Results of Newcrest for the period November 6 to December 31, 2023 and the year ended December 31, 2024 are included in this report. For further information, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBased on a comprehensive review of the Company’s portfolio of assets following the Newcrest transaction, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a portfolio optimization program to divest six non-core assets and a development project in February 2024. The non-core assets to be divested include Akyem, CC&V, Éléonore, Porcupine, Musselwhite, Telfer, and a development project in Canada. In February 2024, the Company concluded that these non-core assets and the development project met the accounting requirements to be presented as held for sale in the first quarter of 2024. Subsequently in the second half of 2024, the Company entered into definitive agreements to sell the Telfer, Akyem, Musselwhite, Éléonore, and CC&V reportable segments, of which Telfer closed in 2024. In January 2025, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Porcupine reportable segment. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on divestitures. \nSegment Information\nThe Company's reportable segments consist of each of its 16 mining operations that it manages and its 38.5% proportionate interest in Nevada Gold Mines (\"NGM\") which it does not directly manage. The reportable segments at December 31, 2024 include certain reportable segments that are designated as held for sale and exclude those which have been divested. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on divestitures.\nFor information on acquisitions and divestitures impacting the comparability of our results, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRefer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, below, and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to our reportable segments. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to domestic and export sales and lack of dependence on a limited number of customers.\nProducts\nReferences in this report to “attributable” means that portion of gold, copper, silver, lead, or zinc produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated, and inferred resources based on our proportionate ownership, unless otherwise noted.\nGold\nGeneral. The details of our consolidated and attributable gold production from continuing operations are set forth below:\n\n                                                                                                                            Year Ended December 31,\n2024                                                                                                                 2023                      2022\nConsolidated gold ounces produced (thousands)                                         6,545                     5,401                     5,786    \nAttributable gold ounces produced (thousands)                                         6,849                     5,545                     5,956    \nAttributable gold ounces produced from equity method investments (thousands):                                                                      \nPueblo Viejo (40.0%)                                                                    235                       224                       285    \nFruta del Norte (32.0%) (1)                                                             138                         —                         —    \n373                                                                                                               224                       285    \n____________________________\n(1)The Fruta del Norte mine is wholly owned and operated by Lundin Gold Inc. (\"Lundin Gold\"). The Company acquired a 32.0% interest in Lundin Gold through the Newcrest transaction, which is accounted for as an equity method investment on a quarterly lag. As a result, results of operations were not reported until the first quarter of 2024. Refer to Notes 3 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 85%, 89% and 87%, respectively, of our Sales were attributable to gold. Most of our Sales come from the sale of refined gold. The end product at our gold operations, however, is generally doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver is credited to our account or delivered to buyers. Additionally, a portion of gold is sold in concentrate containing other metals such as copper, silver, lead, and/or zinc.\nGold Uses. Gold generally is used for fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions, and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins, and jewelry.\nGold Supply. A combination of mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on public information available, for the years ended December 31, 2022 through 2024, mine production has averaged approximately 75% of the annual gold supply with the remainder primarily sourced from recycled gold.\nGold Price.

Copper, silver, lead, and zinc sales are generally in the form of concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining.\nThe following table details consolidated co-product production and the percentage of Sales that was attributable to copper, silver, lead, and zinc for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:\n\n2024                                                                                                                                                                                  2023                                                                             2022\n                                          Co-product Production                 Sales as % of Total Sales                  Co-product Production                 Sales as % of Total Sales                  Co-product Production                 Sales as % of Total Sales\nCopper (pounds/millions) (1)                                338                              7          %                                    145                              5          %                                     84                              3          %\nSilver (ounces/millions) (2)                                 33                              4          %                                     18                              3          %                                     30                              5          %\nLead (pounds/millions) (2)                                  212                              1          %                                    113                              1          %                                    149                              1          %\nZinc (pounds/millions) (2)                                  569                              3          %                                    230                              2          %                                    377                              4          %\n____________________________\n(1)For the years December 31, 2024 and 2023, copper co-product production came from Red Chris, Boddington, Cadia, and Telfer. All of our copper co-product production came from Boddington for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(2)All of our silver, lead, and zinc co-product production came from Peñasquito.\nBy-product Metals\nIf a metal expected to be mined falls below the co-product sales value percentages, the metal is considered a by-product. Revenues from by-product sales are credited to Costs applicable to sales in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAside from the co-product sales at Red Chris, Peñasquito, Boddington, Cadia, and Telfer, copper and silver produced at other Newmont sites are by-product metals.\nGold and Other Metals Processing Methods\nDoré. Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either milling or heap leaching, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water into a slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit to recover the gold. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable, synthetically lined pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold contained within the ore. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.\nGold contained in ores that are not naturally-oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is liberated and amenable to cyanidation, generally known as free milling ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.\nSome gold sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave, roaster, or fine grinding circuit to recover the gold through leaching. Gold-bearing solution is then plated onto cathodes in an electrowinning process or precipitated using zinc powder. In both cases, the precipitate is melted with fluxes in a furnace to produce doré.\nConcentrate. Ore containing zinc, silver, lead, and gold is delivered to a crushing and grinding plant which feeds a sulfide processing plant. The sulfide processing plant primarily comprises lead and zinc flotation stages. In the lead and zinc flotation, the slurry is conditioned with reagents to activate the desired minerals and produce lead and zinc concentrate. The lead concentrate is highly enriched in gold and silver, with a smaller fraction of the precious metal recovered in the zinc concentrate. The resulting concentrate is sold to smelters or traders for further processing.\nOre containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by successive stages of flotation resulting in a gold/copper concentrate containing approximately 10% to 26% copper and is dewatered and transported off-site. The flotation tailings have a residual gold content that is recovered in a carbon-in-leach circuit.\nA summary of product and form by segment is set forth below.\n\nSegment                       Products (1)                     Form                       \nBrucejack, Canada             Gold                             Doré, Concentrate          \nRed Chris, Canada             Gold, Copper                     Concentrate                \nPeñasquito, Mexico            Gold, Silver, Lead, Zinc         Doré, Concentrate (2)      \nMerian, Suriname              Gold                             Doré                       \nCerro Negro, Argentina        Gold                             Doré                       \nYanacocha, Peru               Gold                             Doré                       \nBoddington, Australia         Gold, Copper                     Doré, Concentrate          \nTanami, Australia             Gold                             Doré                       \nCadia, Australia              Gold, Copper                     Doré, Concentrate          \nLihir, Papua New Guinea       Gold                             Doré                       \nAhafo, Ghana                  Gold                             Doré                       \nNGM, U.S.                     Gold                             Doré, Concentrate          \nHeld for Sale (3)                                                                         \nCC&amp;V, U.S.                Gold                             Doré                       \nMusselwhite, Canada           Gold                             Doré                       \nPorcupine, Canada             Gold                             Doré                       \nÉléonore, Canada              Gold                             Doré                       \nAkyem, Ghana                  Gold                             Doré                       \nDivested (4)                                                                              \nTelfer, Australia             Gold, Copper                     Doré, Concentrate          \n____________________________\n(1)Products listed are only for gold and co-product metals. See above for further information on co-product classification.\n(2)In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company abandoned the pyrite leach plant at Peñasquito resulting in no production of doré for the year ended 2024. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n(3)Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on held for sale.\n(4)In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of the assets of the Telfer reportable segment. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCompetition\nThe top 10 producers of gold comprise approximately twenty-five percent of total worldwide mined gold production. We currently rank as the top gold producer with approximately five percent of estimated total worldwide mined gold production. Our competitive position is based on the size and grade of our ore bodies anchored in a large portfolio of Tier 1 assets located in favorable mining jurisdictions. A Tier 1 asset is defined as having, on average over such asset’s mine life: (1) production of over 500,000 GEOs per year on a consolidated basis, (2) average AISC per oz in the lower half of the industry cost curve, (3) an expected mine life of over 10 years, and (4) operations in countries that are classified in the A and B rating ranges for Moody’s, S&P and Fitch.\nWe have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures. Our costs are driven by the location, grade and nature of our ore bodies, and the level of input costs, including energy, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits, hire and retain a skilled workforce, and to manage our costs.\nLicenses and Concessions\nOther than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no third-party patents, operating licenses or franchises material to our business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to land-related licenses which include leases, concessions, claims, or prospecting licenses granted by the host government.

Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nOverview. Focusing on environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") practices are an important part of Newmont’s business. Widely recognized for our principled ESG practices, we have been consistently ranked as a leader in the mining and metal sector S&P Global, and we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index since 2007.\nESG is a key part of how we make investment decisions and central to our culture and purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. Sustainability and safety are integrated into the business at all levels of the organization through our global policies, standards, strategies, business plans, and remuneration plans. Our global strategies, notably those related to Sustainability and Health, Safety, and Security, direct all levels of our business in environmental stewardship, strong workforce safety and health practices, social responsibility and good governance. With clear targets, open communication and transparent reporting, we strive for continuous improvement to meet the evolving expectations of investors, governments, communities and other key stakeholders, and to contribute to a sustainable future for all.\nStakeholder Engagement. We engage regularly with relevant stakeholders, who we consider to be any person or organization potentially impacted by our activities or influential to our success, which allows us to gain a greater understanding of their needs, interests and perspectives while, at the same time, encouraging shared decision making to promote mutually beneficial outcomes. These engagements also inform what information is most useful for stakeholders for the purposes of our non-financial reporting. Newmont also engages with and commits to meeting the expectations of a variety of organizations at a global, regional, national and local level - and where applicable - adhering to these organizations' high standards of governance, social and environmental policies and performance. These memberships and other external commitments reflect our values, support our approach to working collaboratively on best practices across several key matters and allow external stakeholders to hold us accountable. Our participation in industry initiatives, wherein we often take a leadership role, allows us to inform and influence global standards and practices, as well as gain insight into emerging expectations and issues.\nReporting. We believe that transparency and accountability are key attributes of governance. Since 2003, Newmont has been reporting on how we manage the sustainability issues of relevance to stakeholders around the globe. Our sustainability report provides an annual review of non-financial performance on governance, strategy and management approach, risk management, and performance and targets in key areas that include health, safety and security, workforce, the environment, supply chain, social responsibility, business integrity and compliance, value sharing, and equity, inclusion and diversity domains. Our sustainability report is compiled in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (\"GRI\") 2021 Universal Standards Core option, the GRI Mining and Metals Sector Supplement, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\"SASB\") Metals & Mining standards. Data is subject to an external limited assurance review and reflects Newmont’s commitment to transparency and reporting obligations as a founding member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (\"ICMM\") and as an early adopter of the United Nations (\"UN\") Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. Additionally, our sustainability report aligns with the requirements the ICMM's Mining Principles' Performance Expectations and Position Statements, the GISTM and the World Gold Council's Responsible Gold Mining Principles.\nNewmont’s sustainability reporting suite also includes our sustainability-linked bond framework, ESG data tables, conflict-free gold report, modern slavery statement, policy influence disclosures, political spending disclosures, taxes and royalties contributions report, CDP (formerly, “Carbon Disclosure Project”) responses, and other reports and responses, which can be found on our website at www.newmont.com/sustainability. \nThe information on our website, including, without limitation, in the annual sustainability report and climate report, should not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report or otherwise “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.\nEnvironmental Practices\nClimate Change. We accept the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (\"IPCC\") assessment of climate science, and we acknowledge that human activities contribute to climate change and business has an important role in addressing this global challenge. It is our firm belief that climate change is one of the greatest global challenges of our time. For a discussion of climate-related risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors. \nClimate Targets and Initiatives to Achieve. We believe that value-creation industries like mining have a responsibility to drive actions to transition us to a low-carbon economy. In an effort to play our part in addressing climate change, in 2020 we announced science-based, GHG emissions reduction targets of 32% for Scope 1 and Scope 2 and 30% for Scope 3 by 2030 (\"2030 climate targets\"), with an ultimate goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. Newmont's emission calculation methodology framework dictates that any change of 5% resulting from divestitures or acquisitions requires recalculation of baseline data. The acquisition of Newcrest in November 2023 triggered Newmont to recalculate the target baseline years and trailing years of GHG emissions data. We are continuing to review our targets and roadmap which may result in amendments in the future. Investors are reminded that climate-\nrelated targets are subject to aspirational management goals and forward-looking statements, which remain subject to risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements, below, and Item 1A, Risk Factors of this report under the heading \"Our operations and projects are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy.\"\nOur most significant opportunities to reduce emissions exist in building or deploying cleaner energy solutions at our mine sites, as well as the greening of the electrical grid that supplies energy to our operations. Since announcing our 2030 climate targets, we have taken steps to invest in climate change initiatives in support of our goal. We also see sustainable finance as a way to further demonstrate Newmont's focus on climate change. In December 2021, Newmont became the first in the mining industry to issue a sustainability-linked bond, with the registered public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.6% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2032 (the \"Notes\"), with the coupon linked to Newmont’s performance against key ESG goals regarding 2030 climate targets. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Newmont published a Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework and obtained a second party opinion on the framework from Institutional Shareholder Services group of companies (\"ISS\") ESG. The Notes align Newmont’s business and financing by creating a direct link between its sustainability performance and funding strategies.\nIn addition to our focus on reducing carbon emissions, we believe that access to clean, safe water is a human right, and reliable water supplies are vital for hygiene, sanitation, livelihoods and the health of the environment. Because water is also critical to our business, we recognize the need to use water efficiently, protect water resources, and collaborate with the stakeholders within the watersheds where we operate to effectively manage this shared resource. We operate in water-stressed areas with limited supply and increasing population and water demand. Increasing pressure on water use may occur due to increased populations in and around communities in proximity to our operations.\nBiodiversity. Our operations span five continents in a range of ecosystems that include tropical, desert and arctic climates. We understand the impact our activities can have on the environment and are committed to protect and prevent – or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate – those impacts in the areas where we operate through responsible management during all aspects of the mine lifecycle and collaboration with stakeholders to develop integrated approaches to land use. \nOur Environmental Impact. We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing.\nOur Environmental Reclamation and Remediation Commitments. Each operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets, in all material respects, applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are also involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historical, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites. The reclamation and remediation stage is a multifaceted process with complex risks. Successfully closing and reclaiming mines is crucial for gaining stakeholder trust and maintaining social acceptance. Notably, Newmont is committed to the implementation of the GISTM and disclosure of implementation status for tailings facilities by August 2025. Conformance with the GISTM remains ongoing and has and may continue to result in further increases to our sustaining costs and estimated closure costs. Additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements for operations and water treatment in connection with closure are becoming increasingly stringent. Compliance with water management and discharge quality remains dynamic and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated closure costs. For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and remediation activities, refer to Note 6 and Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of regulatory, tailings storage facilities, water, climate and other environmental risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information. \nSocial Practices\nOur People. At Newmont, one of the strategic pillars is people. \nThe success of our business comes from the accomplishments and well-being of our employees and contractors. That is why we strive to build a workplace culture that fosters leaders where everyone belongs, thrives, and is valued.\nAt December 31, 2024, approximately 22,200 people were employed by Newmont and Newmont subsidiaries and approximately 20,400 people were working as contractors in support of Newmont’s operations and attainment of our objectives. Additionally, at December 31, 2024, approximately 30% of our workforce were members of a union or participated in collective bargaining. We are committed to fostering solid relationships with all members of our workforce based on trust, treating workers fairly and providing them with safe and healthy working conditions. For a discussion of related risks, refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nOur people strategy represents a multi-year journey, and its three pillars and respective aspirations include: (i) leadership – grow and attract exceptional leaders for our Company, the industry and beyond; (ii) inclusion, diversity and equity - through bold actions cultivate an inclusive, diverse and engaged workforce; and (iii) people experiences - foster a meaningful work experience that enables our culture and strategy to flourish. The Board of Directors’ Leadership Development and Compensation Committee holds reviews with management every quarter and on an ad hoc basis as needed to ensure appropriate management of human capital and progress against our stated goals.\nThe people who work on our behalf give us a competitive advantage. Through our global people strategy, we align our talent management efforts with the overall business strategy. The strategy’s focus areas include enhancing the employee experience and evolving for future workforce needs; building our bench strength and leadership capabilities; developing effective labor relations that align stakeholders with a shared future; and improving inclusion.\nInclusion, Diversity, and Equity. Inclusion is one of our five core values. We support this through a focus on our culture and four key areas of inclusion: (i) start with respect; (ii) listen to and engage employees; (iii) leverage dissonance, consistency, and persistence toward a future state culture; and (iv) focus on the career progress of underrepresented team members. Newmont is an equal employment opportunity employer and Newmont's policy is to not make employment-related decisions based on gender or any other protected basis.\nIn our annual sustainability report, Newmont voluntarily reports workforce and labor information in accordance with GRI Standards, including data on workforce demographics, compensation and equal remuneration, gender diversity, union representation, labor relations, employee turnover, hiring representation, and training and development. Newmont also reports employment data in U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEO-1 reports which can be found on our website. The information in our sustainability report and on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report.\nESG Performance-based Compensation. The importance of ESG performance is emphasized with our workforce through our training and development programs and our compensation design. Employees eligible for our short-term incentive plan are held accountable for the Company’s health, safety, and sustainability performance through Newmont’s performance-based compensation structure. ESG will comprise 30% of the Company’s Short-term Incentive Plan payout for 2024, with 20% allocated to health & safety metrics and 10% to sustainability performance based community and environment metrics.\nAdditional information regarding the Company’s compensation programs and performance will be provided in the 2025 Proxy Statement. \nHealth and Safety. Safeguarding the health and safety of our employees and contractors is fundamental to how we operate. Mining activities pose risks and hazards that must be effectively managed and controlled to minimize their impact. Safety is one of Newmont's core values, and our global Health, Safety, and Security strategy aims to advance our journey toward a workplace free from fatalities, injuries and illnesses. We believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We continue to sustain robust controls at our operations and offices around the globe. We measure the effectiveness of our approach to managing the wide range of health and safety risks by setting measurable objectives and targets. The quality and effectiveness of our health and safety controls are audited regularly as part of our assurance and governance process. \nCommitments to Communities. Gaining and maintaining the trust of stakeholders impacted by a business is an ongoing endeavor. At Newmont, we use a methodical approach to managing stakeholder relationships and earning social acceptance. Through understanding and managing our activities' impacts on communities and involving local stakeholders in decision making, we aim to build ensuring relationships based on respect and mutually beneficial and sustainable development outcomes. We monitor various metrics and performance objectives to assess the effectiveness of our social acceptance approach, and to better understand both the positive and negative impacts that our activities have on host communities. We seek to include impacted communities and groups in determining mitigation or optimization of these impacts in a manner that is culturally appropriate and with the consent of those impacted. We also recognize our responsibility to respect and promote human rights.\nGovernance Practices \nBoard of Directors Oversight. Newmont believes that strong corporate governance, with management accountability and active oversight from an experienced Board of Directors, is essential for mitigating risk, serving in the best interests of all stakeholders and creating long-term value. The highest level of oversight at Newmont resides with Newmont’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Board plays a critical role, overseeing the Company’s business strategy and the overall goal of delivering long-term value creation for stockholders and other stakeholders. The members of Newmont’s Board bring a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and talents, along with ethnic, racial and gender diversity, to our governance process. As of December 31, 2024, the Board was comprised of 13 directors (12 independent non-executive directors and one executive director) with more than 58% of the independent directors with a form of ethnic, racial or gender diversity to the Board, with 42% female representation among independent directors. \nFour core Board committees, Audit, Corporate Governance and Nominating, Leadership Development and Compensation, and Safety and Sustainability, provide oversight and guidance in these key areas. Each committee assists the Board in carrying out responsibilities such as assessing major risks, ensuring high standards of ethical business conduct, succession planning and talent management, and approving and providing oversight of the sustainability strategy, which includes commitments to adoption of best practices in promotion of a healthy and safe work environment, and environmentally sound and socially responsible mining and resource development. All members of these four core Committees are independent, as defined in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and Newmont’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. More information on Newmont’s Board, governance practices and risk oversight can be found in our annual Proxy Statement. \n Code of Conduct. Our global Code of Conduct (the “Code”), which was adopted and approved by Newmont’s Board, forms the foundation for our integrity expectations, and six overarching policies, along with our standards on Anti-Corruption, Conflicts of \nInterest, Gifts and Entertainment and U.S. Export Compliance, state the minimum requirements for conducting business honestly, ethically and in the best interests of Newmont. Our Code reflects our belief that as important as what we do is how we do it. It requires all representatives of Newmont to demonstrate our values – safety, integrity, sustainability, inclusion and responsibility – in every aspect of our professional lives and ultimately, to live up to our purpose, which is to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. \nGovernance Materials. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Proxy Statement, policies, and the charters for the Committees of Board of Directors are available on our website, www.newmont.com, and are available free of charge upon request to Investor Relations at our principal executive office. We also file with the New York Stock Exchange an annual certification that our Chief Executive Officer is unaware of any violation of the NYSE’s corporate governance standards. We make available free of charge through our website this annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Refer to “Forward-Looking Statements.”\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Business\nA substantial or extended decline in gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc prices would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the prices of gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc, which fluctuate on a daily basis and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control. Factors tending to influence prices include:\n•Gold sales, purchases or leasing by governments and central banks;\n•Speculative short positions taken by significant investors or traders in gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc or other metals;\n•The relative strength of the U.S. dollar;\n•The monetary policies employed by the world’s major Central Banks;\n•The fiscal policies employed by the world’s major industrialized economies;\n•Expectations of the future rate of inflation;\n•Interest rates;\n•Recession or reduced economic activity in the United States, Australia, China, India and other industrialized or developing countries;\n•Decreased industrial, jewelry, base metal or investment demand;\n•Increased import and export taxes;\n•Increased supply from production, disinvestment and scrap;\n•Forward sales by producers in hedging or similar transactions; \n•Availability of cheaper substitute materials; and\n•Changing investor or consumer sentiment, including in connection with transition to a low-carbon economy, investor interest in crypto currencies and other investment alternatives and other factors.\nAverage gold prices for 2024 were $2,386 per ounce (2023: $1,941; 2022: $1,800), average copper prices for 2024 were $4.15 per pound (2023: $3.85; 2022: $3.99), average silver prices for 2024 were $28.27 per ounce (2023: $23.35; 2022: $21.73), average lead prices for 2024 were $0.94 per pound (2023: $0.97; 2022: $0.98), and average zinc prices for 2024 were $1.26 per pound (2023: $1.20; 2022: $1.58). Any decline in our realized prices adversely impacts our revenues, net income and operating cash flows, particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to sales of gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc. We have recorded impairments in the current year and may experience additional impairments in future years as a result of lower gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc prices.\nIn addition, sustained lower gold, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices can:\n•Reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits, or portions of deposits, that become uneconomic at sustained lower metal prices;\n•Reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads and increase the likelihood and amount that the Company might be required to record write downs related to the carrying value of its stockpiles and ore on leach pads;\n•Halt or delay the development of new projects;\n•Reduce funds available for exploration and advanced projects with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced; and\n•Reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices.\nWe may be unable to replace gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc reserves as they become depleted.\nMining companies must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, by locating new deposits or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and uncertainties and is frequently unsuccessful in discovering significant mineralization. Accordingly, our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.\nWe may consider, from time to time, the acquisition of ore reserves from others related to development properties and operating mines. Such acquisitions are typically based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical operating results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of ore reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. Other factors that affect our decision to make any such acquisitions may also include our assumptions for future gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc prices or other mineral prices and the projected economic returns and evaluations of existing or potential liabilities associated with the property and its operations and projections of how these may change in the future. In addition, in connection with any acquisitions we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties (including ability to permit and compliance with existing regulations) and which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. Other than historical operating results, all these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our revenue, our cash flow and other operating issues, as well as contributing to the uncertainties related to the process used to estimate reserves and resources. In addition, there may be intense competition for the acquisition of attractive mining properties.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nEstimates of proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.\nThe mineral reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum that we estimated, at December 31, 2024, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, or will be, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc, and molybdenum and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, which data may not necessarily be indicative of future results. If our reserve estimations are required to be revised due to significantly lower gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc, and molybdenum prices, increases in operating costs, reductions in metallurgical recovery or other modifying factors, this could result in material write-downs of our investment in mining properties, goodwill and increased amortization, reclamation and closure charges.\nProducers use pre-feasibility or feasibility studies for undeveloped ore bodies to derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the predicted configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, the costs of comparable facilities, the costs of operating and processing equipment and other factors. Actual operating and capital cost and economic returns on projects may differ significantly from original estimates. Further, it may take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time, the economic feasibility of production may change.\nAdditionally, resources do not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by the SEC or the Company’s standards. Estimates of measured, indicated and inferred resources are subject to further exploration and development, and are, therefore, subject to considerable uncertainty. Inferred resources, in particular, have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and their economic and legal feasibility. The Company cannot be certain that any part or parts of the resource will ever be converted into mineral reserves.\nIn addition, if the price of gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc, or molybdenum declines from recent levels, if production costs increase, grades decline, recovery rates decrease or if applicable laws and regulations are adversely changed, the indicated level of recovery may not be realized or mineral reserves or resources might not be mined or processed profitably. Similarly, mineral reserves may be impacted if assumptions relating to mine planning change or are not achieved, for example if planned improvements from our Full Potential programs are not realized. If we determine that certain of our mineral reserves have become uneconomic, this may ultimately lead to a reduction in our aggregate reported mineral reserves and resources. Consequently, if our actual mineral reserves and resources are less than current estimates, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position may be materially impaired.\nMineral reserves and resources disclosed in this Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with the Regulation S-K 1300. In 2021, the Company transitioned its approach to reporting and internal methodologies to take into account the required change from the SEC’s Industry Guide 7 to Regulation S-K 1300. To the extent that regulators adopt new requirements and issue or modify related guidance and interpretations in the future, it could result in changes to mineral reserve and mineral resource information. \nEstimates relating to projects and mine plans of existing operations are uncertain and we may incur higher costs and lower economic returns than estimated.\nMine development and expansion projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible. Such projects could experience unexpected problems and delays during permitting, development, construction and mine start-up. Our decision to develop a project is typically based on the results of studies, which estimate the anticipated economic returns of a project. The actual project profitability or economic feasibility may differ from such estimates as a result of any of the following factors, among others:\n•Changes in tonnage, grades and metallurgical characteristics of ore to be mined and processed;\n•Changes in input commodity and labor costs, including as a result of inflation or tariffs;\n•The quality of the data on which engineering assumptions were made;\n•Increases in development capital and investment costs;\n•Adverse geotechnical, geothermal and hydrogeological conditions;\n•Availability of adequate and skilled labor force;\n•Availability, supply and cost including: critical assets, water, reagents, and power;\n•Costs related to environmental management and sales including waste management, monitoring and transport and storage of product sales;\n•Fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates;\n•Availability, cost and terms of financing;\n•Ability to achieve anticipated benefits, synergies, savings and other efficiencies in connection with acquisitions, full potential programs and initiatives, and through portfolio optimization and divestitures;\n•Delays or inability to obtain environmental or other government permits or approvals or changes in the laws and regulations related to our operations or project development;\n•Changes in tax laws, customs law and tariffs, the laws and/or regulations around royalties and other taxes due to the regional and national governments and royalty agreements;\n•Government instability, including in jurisdictions that do not have a long-standing or significant mining industry, such that there may be limited clarity on agreements with such governments, or decreased governmental support for development of mining projects;\n•Weather or severe climate impacts, including, without limitation, prolonged or unexpected precipitation, drought and/or sub-zero temperatures;\n•Potential delays and restrictions in connection with health and safety issues, including pandemics (such as COVID-19 and related variants) and other infectious diseases, such as malaria or the zika virus;\n•Potential delays relating to social and community issues, including, without limitation, issues resulting in protests, road blockages or work stoppages; and\n•Potential challenges to mining activities or to permits or other approvals or delays in development and construction of projects based on claims of disturbance of cultural resources or the inability to secure consent generally from Indigenous groups.\nNew projects require, among other things, the successful completion of feasibility studies, attention to various fiscal, tax and royalty matters, obtainment of, and compliance with, required governmental and regulatory permits and arrangements for necessary surface and other land rights. We may also have to identify adequate sources of water and power for new projects, ensure that appropriate community infrastructure (for example, reliable rail, ports, roads, and bridges) is developed to support the project and secure appropriate financing to fund a new project. These infrastructures and services are often provided by third parties whose operational activities are outside of our control. Establishing infrastructure for our development projects requires significant resources, identification of adequate sources of raw materials and supplies, and the cooperation of national and regional governments, none of which can be assured. In addition, new projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future financial and operating performance, including future cash flow. Thus, it is possible that actual costs may increase and economic returns may differ materially from our estimates. Consequently, our future development activities may not result in the expansion or replacement of current production with new production, or one or more of these new production sites or facilities may be less profitable than currently \nanticipated or may not be profitable at all, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nFor our existing operations, we base our mine plans on geological and metallurgical assumptions, financial projections and commodity price estimates. These estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves, revisions to environmental obligations, changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other significant events associated with or impacting mining operations. Further, future positive revisions, if any, remain subject to improvements in costs, recovery, commodity price or a combination of these and other factors. Additionally, we review our operations for events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are determined to exist at our mine operations, and an impairment charge is incurred, such charges are not reversible at a later date even when favorable modifications to our proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources, favorable revisions to environmental obligations, favorable changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, and other favorable events occur. As a result of these uncertainties, actual results may be less favorable than estimated returns and initial financial outlook.\nIncreased operating and capital costs could affect our profitability.\nCosts at any particular mining location are subject to variation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel, concrete and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make production at certain operations less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses, and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow.\nOur operational costs, including, without limitation, labor costs, can be impacted by inflation. Certain of our operations are located in countries that have in the past experienced high rates of inflation, such as in Argentina, Suriname, and Ghana. It is possible that in the future, high inflation in the countries in which we operate may result in an increase in operational costs in local currencies (without a concurrent devaluation of the local currency of operations against the dollar or an increase in the dollar price of gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc). A material increase in costs at any significant location could have a significant effect on our profitability and operating cash flow. \nWe could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with new projects, costs related to closure reclamation activities, and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond our control. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the profitability of and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects. Significantly higher and sustained increases in operational costs or capital expenditures could result in the deferral or closure of projects and mines in the event that costs become prohibitive.\nMine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.\nNatural resource extractive companies are required to close their operations and rehabilitate the lands that they mine in accordance with a variety of environmental laws and regulations. Estimates of the total ultimate closure and rehabilitation costs for gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead mining operations are significant and based principally on current legal, community and regulatory requirements and mine closure plans that may change materially. \nAdditionally, we may be held responsible for the costs of addressing contamination at the site of current or former activities or at third party sites or be held liable to third parties for exposure to hazardous substances should those be identified in the future. Under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) and its state law equivalents, current or former owners of properties may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of site cleanup or required to undertake remedial actions in response to unpermitted releases of hazardous substances at such property, in addition to, among other potential consequences, liability to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may be significant. These subject properties are referred to as “superfund” sites. For example, the inactive Midnite uranium mine is a superfund site subject to CERCLA. It is possible that certain of our other current or former operations, projects or exploration locations in the U.S. could be designated as a superfund site in the future, exposing us to potential liability under CERCLA.\nThe laws and regulations governing mine closure and reclamation in a particular jurisdiction are subject to review at any time and may be amended to impose additional requirements and conditions which may cause our provisions for environmental liabilities to be underestimated and could materially affect our financial position or results of operations. For a more detailed description of potential environmental liabilities, see the discussion in Environmental Matters in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, regulators are increasingly requesting security in the form of cash collateral, credit, trust arrangements or guarantees to secure the performance of environmental obligations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position. Any underestimated or unanticipated retirement and rehabilitation costs could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Environmental liabilities are accrued when they become known, or new permit conditions or limits are added, are probable and can be \nreasonably estimated. Whenever a previously unrecognized remediation liability becomes known, or a previously estimated reclamation cost is increased, the amount of that liability and additional cost will be recorded at that time and could materially reduce our consolidated net income attributable to Newmont stockholders and potentially result in impairments.\nFor example, in early 2015 and again in June 2017, the Peruvian government agency responsible for certain environmental regulations, the MINAM, issued proposed modifications to water quality criteria for designated beneficial uses which apply to mining companies, including Yanacocha. These criteria modified the in-stream water quality criteria pursuant to which Yanacocha has been designing water treatment processes and infrastructure. In 2017, Yanacocha submitted a modification to its previously approved compliance achievement plan to the MINEM. In May 2022, Yanacocha submitted a proposed modification to this plan requesting an extension of time for coming into full compliance with the new regulations to 2027. In June 2023, Yanacocha received approval of its updated compliance plan from MINEM and was granted an extension to June 2026 to achieve compliance. The Company appealed this approval to the Mining Council requesting the regulatory extension until 2027, and in April 2024, MINEM approved the compliance schedule.\nThe Company is conducting detailed studies to better estimate water management and other closure activities that will ensure water quality and quantity discharge requirements, including the modifications promulgated by MINAM, as referenced above, will be met. This also includes performing a comprehensive update to the Yanacocha reclamation plan to address changes in closure activities and estimated closure costs while preserving optionality for potential future projects at Yanacocha. These ongoing studies, which will extend beyond the current year, continue to evaluate and revise assumptions and estimated costs of changes to the reclamation plan. While certain estimated costs remain subject to revision, the Company’s asset retirement obligation includes construction and operating costs for two new water treatment plants and initial consideration of known risks (including the associated risk that these water treatment estimates could change in the future as more work is completed). The ultimate construction costs of the two water treatment plants remain uncertain as ongoing study work and assessment of opportunities that incorporates the latest design considerations remain in progress. These and other risks and contingencies that are the subject of ongoing studies could result in future material increases to the reclamation obligation at Yanacocha, including, but not limited to, a comprehensive review of our tailings storage facility management, review of Yanacocha’s water balance and storm water management system and review of post-closure management costs. The ongoing Yanacocha closure studies are expected to be progressed in 2025 and continue in the future. Future material increases or decreases to the asset retirement obligation could occur as additional analyses are completed and further refinements to water quality and volume modeling are completed. Additionally, revisions to the Yanacocha reclamation plan may change in connection with the Company’s ultimate submission and review of the plan with Peruvian regulators. Refer to Notes 6 and 25 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding reclamation and remediation, and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the Company’s interest in Yanacocha.\nDamage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nDamage to our reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of a variety of events and circumstances, and could result in negative publicity (for example, with respect to handling of environmental, tailings and tailings failures, employee, safety and security matters, dealings with local community organizations or individuals, community commitments, handling of cultural sites or resources, and various other matters).\nIn recent years we have provided greater transparency on environmental, social and governance performance in response to stakeholder engagement and requests, and provided supplemental disclosures in our Annual Sustainability Report and other sustainability reports on our website in connection with stakeholder concerns and issues. Such increased transparency may result in greater scrutiny and impact how the Company is perceived. \nOur Code of Conduct (the “Code”) forms the foundation of our internal governance structure as well as our commitment to responsible mining. We encourage employees and others to promptly report incidents of possible violations of the Code and/or our global policies and standards, including without limitation in the areas of business integrity, social and environmental, community relations and human rights. Employees and non-employees, including suppliers and community members, can anonymously report concerns via our third-party-administered helpline. Each mine site also has a complaints and grievances register to record matters raised by local stakeholders. When necessary, we use independent mechanisms agreed to by the complainants, such as a local leader or committee, to facilitate resolution of such matters before they require public or legal intervention. However, we are not always able to resolve these matters before they are raised publicly or in legal or regulatory proceedings and in the future we may not be able to meet the growing demands of stakeholders through these mechanisms. Such matters once publicized may negatively impact our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe growing use of social media to generate, publish and discuss community news and issues and to connect with others has made it significantly easier, among other things, for individuals and groups to share their opinions of us and our activities, whether true or not. We do not have direct control over how we are perceived by others and any resulting loss of reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon information technology and operational technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure or cybersecurity attacks and risks associated with implementation, upgrade, operation and integration.\nOur business operations rely heavily on technology platforms and systems to manage and optimize our globally diverse mining assets. These systems are critical to ensuring safety, operational efficiency, cost management, and meeting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objectives. However, the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats, coupled with the adoption of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and cloud-based platforms, poses important risks to our operations, financial performance, and reputation.\nOur systems, as well as those of our third-party service providers, vendors, and partners, face a wide range of cybersecurity threats, including: Ransomware, malware, and phishing schemes targeting critical systems and sensitive data; unauthorized access and breaches affecting intellectual property, financial information, and operational data; vulnerabilities introduced through supply chain dependencies and third-party security weaknesses; human error, design flaws, and system misconfigurations.\nThe adoption of new technologies and the adoption of remote and flexible work arrangements enhances our operational capabilities but introduces additional risks. AI, for example, is increasingly leveraged by Newmont for decision-making, mineral extraction optimization, and autonomous operations. While AI has the potential to improve efficiency and safety, it also presents unique vulnerabilities, including algorithmic biases that could lead to inaccurate decisions or unintended outcomes; data integrity risks, such as manipulation or corruption of datasets used to train AI systems; unauthorized access or exploitation of AI-powered systems, potentially compromising operations or sensitive data.\nAdditionally, the increased interconnectivity of automated and cloud-based systems and increase of our remote workforce expands our cyber-attack surface, requiring heightened vigilance and advanced security measures. These risks are further compounded for our operations in countries with higher geopolitical risk.\nThe Newmont cybersecurity program is designed to protect our technology platforms and address risks associated with the implementation of emerging technologies. While these efforts are designed to align with industry best practices, no system can eliminate all risks, especially given the pace of technological advancement and the evolving nature and increased frequency of cyber threats. In addition, we do not carry specific cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate such costs due to increased premiums and limited market availability. \nTherefore, a successful cyberattack or other cybersecurity incident could result in production and operational downtimes, data corruption, and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. For example, in 2020, we detected a cyberattack on our systems. Although we were able to respond quickly to stop the continued spread of the threat, it took significant time and resources to fully identify the scope of the attack and to recover our systems and data. The cost of responding to and remediating such event was immaterial. Although the 2020 attempts and other cyber incidents to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for preparing and protecting against such attempts and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient against future attacks. These events may subject us to significant expenses, remediation costs, disputes, financial losses, regulatory actions or investigations, litigation, reputational harm, and delays in the deployment of critical technologies, that could results in damages, material fines and penalties, and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a significant effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. The risks associated with the implementation of emerging technologies, if not effectively mitigated, could undermine the benefits of these advancements and impact our competitive position. \nIn addition, we are subject to various legislation, regulations, directives and guidelines from federal, state, local and foreign agencies, that are intended to strengthen cybersecurity measures required for information and operational technology, and that apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information. Failure to comply with any of applicable legal requirements could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, which could harm our reputation and have a significant effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nTo the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or enter into any joint ventures, our interest in these properties is subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of joint ventures.\nTo the extent we hold or acquire interests in any joint ventures or enter into any joint ventures in the future, the existence or occurrence of one or more of the following circumstances and events could have a material adverse impact on our profitability or the viability of our interests held through joint ventures, which could have a material adverse impact on our future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition:\n•inconsistent economic, political or business interests or goals between partners or disagreements with partners on strategy for the most efficient development or operation of mines;\n•inability to control certain strategic decisions made in respect of properties;\n•exercise of majority rights by our partners so as to take actions for which we may not believe to be in the joint venture’s best interests, including but not limited to decisions related to day to day operations, labor relations, litigation, government relations, political contributions, community relations, project approval and project funding mechanisms;\n•inability of partners to meet their financial and other obligations to the joint venture or third parties;\n•disputes between partners regarding management, funding or other decisions related to the joint venture; and\n•activities conducted by partners outside the joint venture may lead to reputational or regulatory consequences that negatively affect the performance or reputation of the joint venture due to their association.\nTo the extent that we are not the operator of joint venture properties, such that we will be unable to control the activities of the operator, the success of such operations will be beyond our control. In many cases we will be bound by the decisions made by the operator in the operation of such property, and will rely on the operator to manage the property and to provide accurate information related to such property. We can provide no assurance that all decisions of operators of properties we do not control will achieve the expected results.\nFor example, our joint ventures, including the joint venture that combined our and Barrick Gold Corporation’s (“Barrick”) respective Nevada operations, forming NGM, pursuant to the operating agreement entered into on July 1, 2019 between Barrick, Newmont and their wholly-owned subsidiaries party thereto (the “Nevada JV Agreement”), may not be as beneficial to us as expected, whether due to the above-described risks, unfavorable global economic conditions, increases in construction costs, integration challenges, political risks, labor disputes or other factors. Pursuant to the terms of the Nevada JV Agreement, we hold a 38.5 percent economic interest and Barrick holds a 61.5 percent economic interest in NGM. Barrick operates NGM with overall management responsibility and is subject to the supervision and direction of NGM’s Board of Managers, which is comprised of three managers appointed by Barrick and two managers appointed by Newmont. Outside of certain prescribed matters, decisions of the Board of Managers will be determined by majority vote, with the managers appointed by each company having voting power in proportion to such company’s economic interests in NGM. Because we beneficially own less than a majority of the ownership and governance interests in NGM, we have limited control of NGM’s operations, and we depend on Barrick to operate NGM. In the event that Barrick has interests, objectives and incentives with respect to NGM that differ from our own, there can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve such disagreement in our favor. Any such disagreement could have a material adverse effect on our interest in NGM, the business of NGM or the portion of our growth strategy related to NGM. Additionally, to the extent NGM is subject to liabilities or litigation, we would be responsible for a proportional share of certain liabilities and/or NGM’s operations could be impacted, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial position.\nNewmont is also exposed to non-managed investments related to its joint venture interest in Pueblo Viejo mine (40.0% owned) and Norte Abierto (50% owned). We also hold a 32.0% equity interest in Lundin Gold, a Canadian mine development and operating company, operating the Fruta del Norte gold mine in Ecuador, in addition to a variety of exploration and project joint ventures.\nAdditionally, the Company is subject to certain funding requirements in connection with its joint ventures. Joint venture funding requirements, as well as the ability of partners to meet their financial and other obligations, may result in increases to our costs and required capital expenditures and possible delays in joint venture activities. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information including with respect to loan agreements with Pueblo Viejo.\nOur operations and business have in the past been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be materially and adversely impacted in the future by pandemics, epidemics and other health emergencies.\nThe Company faces risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which could significantly disrupt operations and may materially and adversely affect its business and financial conditions. For example, the global COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted our operations in 2020 and 2021, and to a lesser extent in 2022. In order to protect nearby communities and align with government travel restrictions or health considerations, certain of Newmont’s operations were temporarily put into care and maintenance resulting in a temporary decrease in production at these sites in 2020 and 2021. Additionally, the majority of our sites experienced pandemic-related absenteeism in 2021 and early 2022. In addition, the Company incurred costs during 2020 and 2021 as a result of actions taken to protect against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and comply with local mandates, and could be required to incur such costs in the future. Reductions in our operational activities due to COVID-19, or another pandemic, epidemic or health outbreak, could result in additional sites being placed into care and maintenance for extended periods of time and/or have a material adverse impact on our business, or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If the majority of our sites are placed into care and maintenance, this could significantly reduce our cash flow and impact our ability to meet certain covenants related to our revolving credit facility and borrowing capacity. \nFinancial Risk\nIncreased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and capital controls may adversely affect Newmont’s costs, earnings and the value of some of our assets.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the majority of our earnings and cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars. We conduct certain business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. A portion of our operating expenses are incurred in local currencies. The appreciation of those local currencies against the U.S. dollar increases our costs of production in U.S. dollar terms at mines located outside the United States. The foreign currencies that primarily affect our results of operations are the Australian Dollar and the \nCanadian Dollar. Our consolidated earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by movements in the exchange rates. Change in the value of the currencies of the Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso, the Argentine Peso, the Ghana Cedi, the Papua New Guinea Kina, the Chilean Peso, the Surinamese Dollar or the Fijian Dollar versus the U.S. dollar could negatively impact our earnings. For information concerning the sensitivity of our Costs applicable to sales to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and more information our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, see Foreign Currency Exchange Rates section in Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nFrom time to time, countries in which we operate adopt measures to restrict the availability of the local currency or the repatriation of capital across borders. These measures are imposed by governments or central banks, in some cases during times of economic instability, to prevent the removal of capital or the sudden devaluation of local currencies or to maintain in-country foreign currency reserves. In addition, many emerging market countries require consents or reporting processes before local currency earnings can be converted into U.S. dollars or other currencies and/or such earnings can be repatriated or otherwise transferred outside of the operating jurisdiction. These measures may have a number of negative effects on Newmont, reducing the immediately available capital that we could otherwise deploy for investment opportunities or the payment of expenses. Measures that restrict the availability of the local currency or impose a requirement to operate in the local currency may create other practical difficulties for Newmont. For example, Argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary environment with a cumulative inflation rate of over 100% over the last three years. In recent years, Argentina’s central bank enacted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency. These restrictions directly impact the timing of Cerro Negro's ability to remit cash from gold sales and pay interest and principal portions of intercompany debt to the Company. In addition, PNG is currently experiencing a backlog by foreign and domestic companies and governmental agencies to convert Kina into foreign currencies. The Bank of PNG implements foreign exchange controls and manages the exchange rate of the kina against the U.S. dollar. There is a risk that further changes in foreign exchange controls may adversely impact future revenue and profitability. For more information, see Results of Consolidated Operations and Foreign Currency Exchange Rates sections in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations. See also risk factors under the headings “Our operations in Argentina are susceptible to risk as a result of economic and political instability in Argentina and labor unrest”, “Our operations at Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana are subject to political, economic, security and other risks” and “Our Merian operation in Suriname is subject to political, security and economic risks”, “Our operations at Lihir and project at Wafi-Golpu in PNG are subject to political and regulatory risks and other uncertainties” and “Our operations and projects Canada are subject to legal and regulatory risks and other uncertainties in connection with claims and challenges by Indigenous groups” below.\nFuture funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, pay cash dividends or engage in share repurchase transactions.\nPotential future investments, including projects in the Company’s project pipeline, acquisitions and other investments, will require significant funds for capital expenditures. Depending on gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc prices, our operating cash flow may not be sufficient to meet all of these expenditures, or result in strategic reprioritization of the project portfolio, depending on the timing of development of these and other projects. As a result, new sources of capital may be needed to meet the funding requirements of these investments, fund our ongoing business activities, and fund construction and operation of potential future projects. Our ability to raise and service significant new sources of capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions, future gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc prices as well as our operational performance, current cash flow and debt position, among other factors. We may determine that it may be necessary or preferable to issue additional equity or other securities, defer projects or sell assets. For example, in February 2024 Newmont announced its intent to divest non-core assets, including six operations and two projects from its Australian, Ghanaian, and North American business units. At the end of 2024 the sale of Telfer operation and Newmont's 70% interest in the Havieron project closed and definitive agreements were in place to divest four other operations; Akyem, Musselwhite, Éléonore and CC&V. In addition, proceeds were also received from the completed sale of investments, including the sale of the Lundin Gold stream credit facility and offtake agreement, and the monetization of Newmont's Batu Hijau contingent payments.\nU.S. and global markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and events related to the recent and on-going conflicts (such as sanctions in Ukraine, Russia and/or Belarus), have in the past, and may in the future cause volatility and pricing in the capital markets. Additional financing may not be commercially available when needed or, if available, the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and, if raised by offering equity securities, any additional financing may involve substantial dilution to existing stockholders. In the event of lower gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc prices, unanticipated operating or financial challenges, or new funding limitations, our ability to pursue new business opportunities, invest in existing and new projects, fund our ongoing business activities, retire or service all outstanding debt, fund share repurchase programs and transactions and pay dividends could be significantly constrained.\nThe Company’s repurchase program may be discontinued at any time, and the program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares of its common stock or to repurchase the full authorized amount during the authorization period. Consequently, the Board of Directors may revise or terminate such share repurchase authorization in the future. See also the risk factor under the heading “Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends.” In addition, our joint venture partners may not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability in order to make their capital commitments. In the case that our partners do not make their \neconomic commitments, the Company may be prevented from pursuing certain development opportunities or may assume additional financial obligations, which may require new sources of capital.\nOur long-lived assets and goodwill could become impaired, which could have a material non-cash adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe review our operations for events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are determined to exist at our mine operations, we review the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. We also review our goodwill for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Management makes multiple assumptions in estimating future cash flows, which include production levels based on life of mine plans, future costs of production, estimates of future production levels based on value beyond proven and probable reserves at our operations, prices of metals, the historical experience of our operations and other factors. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating production levels of gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc and the costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected financial and operating results or result in future impairment charges. We may be required to recognize material non-cash charges relating to impairments of long-lived assets and/or goodwill in the future if actual results differ materially from management’s estimates, which include metal prices, our ability to reduce or control production costs or capital costs through strategic mine optimization initiatives, increased costs or decreased production due to regulatory issues or if we do not realize the mineable reserves, resources or exploration potential at our mining properties. Additions to asset retirement costs could result in impairment charges. \nWe recorded substantial goodwill, primarily as the result of our acquisition of Newcrest in 2023. We accounted for the acquisition of Newcrest using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that purchase price is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Newcrest based on their respective fair market values. Any excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill. Our balance sheet reflects additions to the carrying amount of goodwill recognized in connection with the Newcrest transaction.\nThe Company continues to evaluate strategic priorities and deployment of capital to projects in the pipeline. A decision to reprioritize, sell or abandon a development project could result in a future impairment charge. For example, in response to challenging market conditions, which included inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, in 2023 the Company announced the deferral for at least two years of the full-funds investment decision for the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. With the delay of the Yanacocha Sulfides project, management will focus on optimizing its allocation of funds to current operations and other capital commitments, while also assessing execution options and project plans options, up to and including transitioning Yanacocha operations into full closure. The Company also periodically updates the economic model for its Conga project to understand changes to the estimated capital costs, cash flows, and economic returns from the project. Certain decisions or changes in circumstances could result in determinations that carrying value is not recoverable and could result in impairment. See Part II, Item 7 under the heading “Critical Accounting Estimates – Carrying value of long-lived assets and Carrying value of Conga” for additional information. \nIf an impairment charge is incurred, such charges are not reversible at a later date even when favorable modifications to our proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources, favorable revisions to environmental obligations, favorable changes in legislation and/or our political or economic environment, or other favorable events occur. As a result of these uncertainties, our operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment, and actual results may be less favorable than estimated returns and initial financial outlook. For additional information regarding goodwill, refer to Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.\nWe recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on historical results of operations, forecasted cash flows from operations, and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. In the future, our estimates could change requiring a valuation allowance or impairment of our deferred tax assets. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Income and Mining Taxes - Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets” and Note 2 under the heading “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets” for additional information and factors that could impact the Company’s ability to realize the deferred tax assets. For additional information regarding Newmont’s non-current deferred tax assets, refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could increase our future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing.\nThere can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, or Fitch Ratings to Newmont will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. The Company’s credit ratings have been subject to change over the years. We currently maintain a Standard & Poor’s rating of “BBB+” (stable outlook). Moody’s Investors Service rating of Baa1 (positive outlook), and a Fitch Ratings rating of A- (stable outlook). We cannot make assurances regarding how long these ratings will remain unchanged or regarding the outcome of the rating agencies future reviews (including following any planned or future business combinations). A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding securities, our existing debt and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase our borrowing costs, which in turn could impair our results of operations and financial position.\nReturns for investments in pension plans are uncertain.\nWe maintain pension plans for certain employees which provide for specified payments after retirement. The Company’s qualified pension plans are funded with cash contributions in compliance with IRS rules and regulations. The Company’s non-qualified and other benefit plans are currently not funded, but exist as general corporate obligations. Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading “Pension and Other Benefit Plans” for additional information regarding the funding status of qualified and non-qualified plans. The Company reviews its retirement benefit programs on a regular basis and will consider market conditions and the funded status of its qualified pension plans in determining whether additional contributions are appropriate. The ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans. Returns, if any, on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions. A sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated. If future plan investment returns are not sufficient, we may be required to increase the amount of future cash contributions.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining.\nThe exploration for natural resources and the development and production of mining operations are activities that involve a high level of uncertainty. These can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n•Environmental hazards, including discharge of metals, concentrates, pollutants or hazardous chemicals;\n•Industrial accidents, including in connection with the operation of heavy mobile equipment, milling equipment and/or conveyor systems and accidents associated with the preparation and ignition of large-scale blasting operations, milling and processing;\n•Accidents in connection with transportation, including transportation of chemicals, explosives or other materials, transportation of large mining equipment and transportation of employees and business partners to and from sites;\n•Social, community or labor force disputes resulting in work stoppages or shipping delays, such as at Peñasquito, Cerro Negro, Merian, Akyem and Lihir, or related loss of social acceptance of community support;\n•Changes and/or increasingly stringent legal and regulatory requirements;\n•Delays in permitting due to reduced resources and capacity for review and formulation of permits at regulatory agencies;\n•Security incidents, including activities of illegal or artisanal miners, gold bullion or concentrate theft, including in transport, and corruption and fraud;\n•Shortages in materials or equipment and energy and electrical power supply interruptions or rationing;\n•Failure of unproven or evolving technologies or loss of information integrity or data; \n•Unexpected geological formations or conditions (whether in mineral or gaseous form);\n•Metallurgical conditions and gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc and other metal recovery, including unexpected decline of ore grade;\n•Unanticipated changes in inventory levels at heap-leach operations;\n•Ground and surface water conditions;\n•Fall-of-ground accidents in underground operations;\n•Failure of mining pit slopes, tailings embankments, and other tailing depositions, or water storage dams;\n•Seismic activity;\n•Surface or underground fires or floods, inundation or inrush of water and other materials; and\n•Other natural phenomena, such as lightning, cyclonic or tropical storms, drought, avalanches, landslides, wildfires, tsunami, floods, or other inclement weather conditions, including those impacting operations or the ability to access and supply sites. \nThe occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration activities, development and production and closure of mining operations may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment and infrastructure, work stoppages, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial position. \nMining operations involve a high degree of risk, including hazards related to the use of explosives and hazardous chemicals and critical equipment failure. \nOur operations are subject to risks associated with the transportation, storage, handling and use of explosives and hazardous chemicals. These include unplanned detonation of explosives and catastrophic release of hazardous chemicals (for example, due to vessel rupture resulting in an explosion or toxic gas release). Critical equipment related risks that apply to various Newmont sites include for example, mill failure arising from catastrophic failure of a component, or unavailability of mine haul fleet. Other critical equipment related risks may be site specific. For example, asset integrity at Lihir may be impacted by the proximity of the mine to a corrosive marine environment. The occurrence of such catastrophic events may result in work stoppages, damage to or destruction of mines and other producing facilities, damage to or loss of life and property, environmental damage and possible legal liability for any or all damage or loss and may adversely affect the Company’s operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on our supply chain operations to procure goods and services to support our operations and projects, and competition with other natural resource companies, and shortage of critical parts, services and equipment may adversely affect our operations and development projects.\nProduction continuity and cost profile can be impacted by risks associated with the management and operation of the Company’s inbound global supply chain (including risks associated with the inventory management of critical equipment, spares and consumables). We rely on our global supply chain to procure goods and services from suppliers and contractors to support our operations and projects. We are exposed to material availability, disruption and performance risks across our supply chain, including lack of suitable suppliers or contractors, cost increases, impacts of pandemics and epidemics on the supply chain, transportation and logistics issues including delays in delivery, disruption to trade flows due to geopolitical tensions and/or changes in legislation, performance of suppliers and contractors to contractual terms, and damage to our reputation caused by actions of our suppliers or contractors. In addition, our ability to competitively source goods and services may be affected by local content procurement commitments in the jurisdictions in which we operate. See the risk factors “We rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects” and “Our operations and projects may be adversely affected by rising energy prices or energy shortages” below for further information.\nInbound supply chain disruptions could lead to mine site production curtailment or stoppage if a critical material or labor input is unavailable. This could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition depending on the duration of the curtailment or stoppage. The Company is also exposed to outbound supply chain risk, particularly fluctuating transportation charges, delays in delivery of shipments, theft, terrorism, geopolitical tensions and border closures and adverse weather conditions.\nIn addition, we compete with other natural resource companies for specialized equipment and supplies necessary for exploration and development, as well as for rights to mine properties containing gold, copper, silver, lead, zinc, and other minerals. The mining industry has been impacted, from time to time, by increased demand for critical resources such as input commodities, drilling equipment, trucks, shovels and tires. These shortages have, at times, impacted the efficiency of our operations, and resulted in cost increases and delays in construction of projects; thereby impacting operating costs, capital expenditures and production and construction schedules. We may be unable to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies, or to acquire additional rights to mine properties, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain or retain necessary permits and land or mining tenure, which could adversely affect our operations and projects.\nOur mining and processing operations and development and exploration activities are subject to extensive permitting requirements. The requirements to obtain and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits can be costly and involve extended timelines. While we strive to obtain and comply with all permits required of us, there can be no assurance that we will obtain all such permits and/or achieve or maintain full compliance with such permits at all times. Previously obtained permits may be suspended or revoked for a number of reasons, including through government or court action. New or amended permits may also be required to continue existing activities, as new laws come into effect or regulators change their application of laws. Failure to obtain and/or comply with required permits can have serious consequences, including damage to our reputation; cessation of the \ndevelopment of a project; increased costs of development or production and litigation or regulatory action, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur ability to obtain the required permits and approvals to explore for, develop and operate mines and to successfully operate near communities in the jurisdictions in which we operate depends in part on our ability to develop, operate and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to operate near certain communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, health and safety of communities in which we operate. Key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be adjusted in a manner that adversely affects our operations, including our ability to explore or develop properties, commence production or continue operations. Permit review and approval could be delayed, adversely impacting project implementation due to delays in review and development of permits from limited resources at the regulatory agencies.\nMany of our mining and processing operations, including tailings storage, project expansions, and exploration and development activities require mineral, mining and/or surface land tenure properties that are leased, granted to, or otherwise acquired by the Company for specified periods of time. Securing, maintaining, extending, and renewing the Company’s rights, titles, or interests (\"Legal Title\") in and to these land tenures can be costly, subject to political, regulatory, and social risks, and no assurance can be provided that all required leases or other types of land tenure will be granted, maintained, extended, or renewed. For example, additional tailings capacity is needed to support future growth and sustainability of Boddington operations beyond 2025. Boddington’s existing tailings facility is expected to reach the permitted capacity in 2026. Following advancement of the life of mine tailings study to explore options for continued tailings deposition, the Company decided to expand the existing F1/F3 Residue Disposal Area (\"RDA\") from an ultimate capacity of 600Mt to 750Mt to provide storage capacity to 2029, subject to permitting and other approvals. Beyond 2029 an additional tailings facility would need to be built, termed RDA2, and this facility is also subject to permitting and other approvals, including additional environmental permits. Further, the Boddington operation is primarily located on mining leases with renewal dates commencing in 2028. The lease renewal, as well as additional leases required in connection with tailings expansion, require cooperation and agreements with third parties. No assurances can be provided that such renewals and additional lease scope for further tailings capacity will be secured at similar cost, commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A failure to secure agreement on commercially reasonable terms could result in increased costs, requirements to move infrastructures, modification to future plans, including cessation of mining. \nSimilarly, the current capacity of the TSFs at Cadia should support operations through to the current permitted time period by exhausting capacity within the current Pit TSF (\"PTSF\") and by constructing a raise to the South Tailings Storage Facility (\"STSF\"), as has been permitted. Studies evaluating potential options to increase tailings storage capacity are underway, including additional placement of tailings on the North Tailings Storage Facility (\"NTSF\") and a proposal to construct an extension to the current STSF (\"STSFX\") to provide capacity to approximately 2050. Cadia is currently approved to continue operations until 2031 and is seeking approval from the NSW Government to extend our mining operations beyond 2031. This is known as the Cadia Continued Operations Project (“CCOP”), of which the construction of an extension to the STSFX is a project feature. No assurances can be provided that approvals will be secured.\nFailure to obtain required land tenure can have serious consequences, including loss of Legal Title in and to mineral and/or surface properties that are owned or controlled by the Company, cessation of operations, project delays or cancellations, increased costs, and potential litigation or regulatory action. Any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, operational performance, and financial condition. See risk factors under the headings “Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical, geothermal and hydrogeological challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability,” and “Title to some of our properties may be insufficient, defective, or challenged”. \nMining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate in order to maintain operations.\nGreater scrutiny on the private sector broadly and multi-national companies specifically, to contribute to sustainable outcomes in the places where they operate, has led to a proliferation of standards and reporting initiatives focused on environmental stewardship, social performance and transparency. Extractive industries, and mining in particular, have seen significant increases in stakeholder expectations. These businesses are increasingly required to meaningfully engage with impacted stakeholders; understand and avoid or mitigate negative impacts while optimizing economic participation and uplift opportunities associated with their operations. The expectation is for companies to create shared value for stockholders, employees, governments, local communities and host countries. Such expectations tend to be particularly focused on companies whose activities are perceived to have high socio-economic and environmental impacts. In Canada, for instance, there is increased expectation that is also increasingly supported by regulations and/or case law for Indigenous communities on whose traditional territories mineral development occurs or is impacted by mineral development to share in the economic prosperity of the mine, and for such communities to share in joint decision making with government regulators on various permitting efforts. Newmont has over many years developed and continues to evolve a robust system of ESG management that includes policies, standards, guidance, assurance, participation in international organizations focused on improved performance and outcomes for host communities and the environment. In Ghana, for instance, in response to resettlement-related complaints, Newmont worked with national and local government authorities, traditional leaders, impacted farmers/landowners and other concerned stakeholders to analyze impacts, extend programs to support vulnerable households and \nprovide enhanced and/or alternative livelihood support. Despite the Company’s commitment to on-going engagement with communities and stakeholders, no assurances can be provided that increased stakeholder expectations will not result in adverse financial and operational impacts to the business, including, without limitation, operational disruption, increased costs, increased investment obligations, increased commitments to local and/or Indigenous communities with fiscal implications, and increased taxes and royalties payable to governments.\nIllegal mining and artisanal mining occur on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks.\nArtisanal, small scale and illegal miners have been active on, or adjacent to, some of Newmont’s African and South American properties, including in Peru, Suriname and Ghana in recent years. For example, in Ghana in 2019, illegal miners attacked a field team of security guards employed by a security contractor, tragically resulting in a fatality. While we are working collaboratively with the artisanal miners in Suriname on a program that includes improving mining practices for improved safety, environmental and processing practices as well as alternative livelihood opportunities, this not always possible. Illegal mining, which involves trespass and occupation of exploration, development, and operating properties present significant security, safety, legal, and environmental risk, which could result in a security threat to human life, infrastructure, and equipment, and lead to the loss of legal title, possession, or use of Newmont's land tenure. The illegal miners from time to time have clashed with security staff and law enforcement personnel who have attempted to move them away from the facilities. Although, under certain circumstances, artisanal mining may be a legally sanctioned activity, artisanal mining is also associated with a number of negative impacts, including environmental degradation, poor working practices, erosion of civil society, human rights abuse and funding of conflict. The environmental, social, legal, safety and health impacts of artisanal and illegal mining are frequently attributed to formal large scale mining activity, and it is often assumed that artisanally-mined gold is channeled through large-scale mining operators, even though artisanal and large-scale miners normally have separate and distinct supply chains. These misconceptions impact negatively on the reputation of the industry. The activities of the illegal miners could cause damage to Newmont’s properties or result in inappropriate or unlawful use of force for which Newmont could potentially be held responsible. The presence of illegal miners could lead to exploration and project delays and disputes regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits. Illegal mining could also result in lost gold production and reserves, mine and development stoppages, and have a material adverse effect on financial condition or results of operations or project development. Finally, it is difficult to separate potential or actual environmental impacts from Newmont's activities from those of artisanal miners who have illegally accessed and are operating on our land tenure. This can cause both reputational and compliance challenges.\nCivil disturbances and criminal activities can disrupt business and expose the Company to liability.\nCivil disturbances and criminal activities such as trespass, illegal mining, sabotage, theft, blockades, organized crime and vandalism may cause disruptions and could result in the suspension of operations, delays to project development and negative impacts on exploration activities at certain sites. Incidents of such activities have occasionally led to conflict with security personnel and/or police, which in some cases resulted in serious injuries or death including in Ghana, Peru, Mexico, PNG and Suriname in recent years. Additionally, some areas in which we conduct operations, develop projects and exploration activities are affected by civil unrest such as in PNG and Ecuador in early 2024, and persistent violence and organized crime involving significant drug cartels, such as in Mexico. \nAlthough security measures have been implemented by the Company to protect employees, community members, property and assets, such measures will not guarantee that such civil disturbances and criminal activities will not continue to occur in the future, or result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, decrease operational efficiency or construction delays, increase community tensions or result in liabilities or reputational harm to Newmont. Security incidents, in the future, may have a material adverse effect on our operations, development projects, exploration and reclamation activities, especially if criminal activity and violence escalate. Such incidents may halt or delay production, increase operating costs; result in harm to employees, contractors, visitors or community members; decrease operational efficiency due to employee absenteeism and other factors; increase community tensions or otherwise adversely affect our ability to conduct business. The manner in which the Company’s personnel, national police or other security forces respond to civil disturbances and criminal activities can give rise to additional risks where those responses are not conducted in a manner consistent with international and Newmont standards relating to the use of force and respect for human rights. Newmont takes seriously our obligation to respect and promote human rights, is a signatory to and active participant in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, and has adopted a Sustainability and Stakeholder Engagement Policy and Human Rights Standard in-line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Nonetheless, although the Company has implemented a number of significant measures and safeguards which are intended to ensure that personnel understand and uphold these standards, the implementation of these measures will not guarantee that personnel, national police or other security forces will uphold these standards in every instance. The evolving expectations related to human rights, human rights defenders, Indigenous rights, and environmental protections may result in opposition to our current and future operations, the development of new projects and mines, and exploration activities. Such opposition may take the form of legal or administrative proceedings or manifestations such as protests, roadblocks or other forms of public expression against our activities, and may have a negative impact on our local or global reputation and operations. Opposition by community and activist groups to our operations may require modification of, or preclude the operation or development of, our projects and mines or may require us to enter into agreements with such groups or local governments with respect to our projects and mines or exploration activities, in some cases, causing increased costs and significant delays to the advancement of our projects. For example, in Peru, our Conga project faced opposition from anti-mining activists, after which we suspended construction on the project’s mining facilities and eventually reclassified Conga’s reserves to resource as the result of certain operating and construction permits expiring at the end of 2015. The failure to conduct operations in accordance with Company \nstandards can result in harm to employees, community members or trespassers, increase community tensions, reputational harm to Newmont or result in criminal and/or civil liability and/or financial damages or penalties.\nOur operations and projects face substantial regulation of health and safety.\nOur operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations governing worker health and safety across our operating regions and our failure to comply with applicable legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. Future changes in applicable laws, regulations, permits and approvals or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could substantially increase costs to achieve compliance, lead to the revocation of existing or future exploration or mining rights or otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur mines are inspected on a regular basis by government regulators who may issue citations and orders when they believe a violation has occurred under local mining regulations. If inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines, penalties or sanctions and our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures. \nIn addition to potential government restrictions and regulatory fines, penalties or sanctions, our ability to operate (including the effect of any impact on our workforce) and thus, our results of operations and our financial position (including because of potential related fines and sanctions), could be adversely affected by accidents, injuries, fatalities or events detrimental (or perceived to be detrimental) to the health and safety of our employees, the environment or the communities in which we operate.\nOur operations and projects are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.\nOur exploration, development, mining and processing operations, and closed facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing land use and the protection of the environment, which generally apply to air and water, protection of endangered, protected or other specified species, hazardous and non-hazardous waste management and reclamation. Many of the countries in which we operate have laws and regulations related to water (quality and quantity), nature and greenhouse gas (“GHG\") emissions which are becoming increasingly more stringent. We have made, and expect to make in the future, significant expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs and burdens, and can cause delays in obtaining, or a failure to obtain or renew, or cancellation of, government permits and approvals which may adversely impact our operations and closure processes. Increased global attention or regulation on consumption of shared resources and use products or development of waste that have the potential to impact human health and the environment could similarly have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to increased compliance and input costs. Specific examples where we face such risks include:\nWaste Rock and Tailings Management\nOur gold and copper mining and ore refining/metals extraction processes generate waste by-products such as waste rock (managed in waste rock dumps or, in the case of Lihir, harbor waste rock platforms and permitted barge dumping locations) and tailings (managed by the use of tailings storage facilities, lacustrine deposition in the case of Brucejack or deep sea tailings placement in the case of Lihir and as proposed at Wafi-Golpu). Tailings storage facilities are constructed progressively throughout the life of the mine to support increasing capacity requirements. If there is a failure in the integrity of a tailings storage facility, there is a risk that tailings or large volumes of water and/or potentially contaminating materials may be released and cause material harm to human health and/or the environment downstream of the facility. Such an occurrence could severely damage our reputation and materially adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. It may also subject us to civil and/or criminal action, penalties and claims from environmental and planning regulators and/or affected third parties, and may lead to the suspension or disruption of our operations and projects. For example, in December 2023 at our now divested Telfer operation in Western Australia, cracking and sinkholes were detected on an internal embankment of the site’s TSF. Upon detection, the Company suspended its processing operations and a prohibition notice limiting the use of the facility was issued by the local regulator, which was lifted in September 2024 following completion of remediation works. See also risk factor under the heading \"Our operations and projects are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies and subject to water-related risk.\"\nTailings Storage Facilities and Dust Emissions at Cadia\nTailings deposition was suspended at Cadia Holdings Pty Ltd’s (“Cadia Holdings”) tailings storage facilities in March 2018 following an embankment slump of its Northern Tailings Storage Facility (“NTSF”). Use of the NTSF is subject to a prohibition notice issued by the NSW Resources Regulator and deposition is expected to remain suspended until repairs of the NTSF wall are completed. In December 2019, Cadia Holdings received approval from the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment (the “NSW DPE”) to fully utilize the decommissioned Cadia Hill mine pit for deposition of thickened tailings. In December 2021, the NSW DPE granted approval to increase the permitted processing capacity from 32 to 35 million tonnes of ore in a calendar year. Such approval is subject to certain conditions, including that Cadia Holdings commission and publish an independent air quality audit report that includes a description of the details and scheduling of all reasonable and feasible best practice measures that are being implemented by Cadia Holdings to minimize off-site air quality impacts of the mine.\nThe independent air quality audit report published by Cadia Holdings in August 2022 indicated that dust emitted from two ventilation exhaust rises which vent emissions from underground processing operations exceeded levels permitted by applicable law. \nDuring the quarter ended June 2023, the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (“NSW EPA”) issued variations to its Environment Protection License (“EPL”), a Prevention Notice and Notices to Provide Information regarding the management of, and investigation into potential breaches relating to, dust emissions and other air pollutants from the Cadia tailings storage facilities and ventilation rises. The license variations largely formalized the actions Cadia Holdings had developed in consultation with the NSW EPA and was already undertaking across a range of measures.\nCadia Holdings received a letter from the NSW EPA in June 2023 requiring it to immediately comply with specific statutory requirements and EPL conditions. Adjustments were implemented underground, including a reduction in mining rates, modifications to the ventilation circuit and the installation of additional dust sprays and spray curtains. Additional dust collection units were subsequently installed enabling normal mining rates to be restored.\nIn August 2023, the NSW EPA commenced proceedings in the Land and Environment Court of NSW (the “NSW Land and Environment Court”) against Cadia Holdings, alleging that air emissions from Cadia in March 2022 exceeded the standard of concentration for total solid particles permitted under applicable laws due to the use of surface exhaust fans at the mine. On September 29, 2023, Cadia Holdings entered a plea of guilty and the NSW Land and Environmental Court listed the case for a sentencing hearing on March 28, 2024. On October 13, 2023, the NSW EPA commenced additional proceedings in the NSW Land and Environment Court against Cadia Holdings, alleging two additional contraventions of applicable air emissions requirements in November 2021 and May 2023 and two contraventions related to alleged air pollution from tailings storage facilities on October 13 and 31, 2022. On November 24, 2023 Cadia Holdings entered a plea of guilty to the two additional charges relating to applicable air emissions requirements the sentencing hearing took place before the NSW Land and Environment Court on June 21, 2024. The matter has been adjourned pending the delivery of the judgment. On October 18, 2024, Cadia Holdings entered a plea of not guilty to the proceedings related to alleged air pollution from Cadia Holdings’ tailings storage facilities. The proceedings have been adjourned for further directions on February 21, 2025. The NSW EPA’s investigation regarding the management of air emissions from the mine is ongoing.\nWhile no specific relief has been sought by the NSW EPA in its proceeding against Cadia Holdings before the NSW Land and Environment Court, the court can impose penalties.\nFailure to maintain compliance with applicable law or Cadia Holdings’ EPL may result in the NSW EPA suspending or revoking Cadia Holdings’ EPL, seeking court orders or issuing additional prevention notices to modify or cease certain activities. Ongoing enforcement, and challenges in maintaining compliance, may impact Cadia Holdings’ ability to secure a future expansion of its project approval to extend the life of mine from 2031 to 2055. In addition, Cadia Holdings has previously been, and may in the future be, subject to prosecutions and penalties for noncompliance with air quality requirements or the terms of its EPL, including in respect of emissions from any vent rise or emissions from the NTSF and the Southern Tailings Storage Facility (“STSF”). Operational changes required to achieve or maintain compliance, including reductions in mining rates and other limitations on mining or processing operations, or additional requirements to install costly pollution control equipment, may adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nEnvironmental Sampling in the Cadia Area\nIn early 2023, residents living near Cadia raised concerns about potential impacts to drinking water supplies by various contaminants, including metals such as lead, nickel and copper, which they allege are related to emissions from the vent rises at Cadia, as well as periodic dust emission events at NTSF and STSF. In response to community concerns, the New South Wales Ministry of Health tested the quality of residents’ kitchen tap water and reported that it was safe to drink. The NSW EPA also undertook water testing in the local area and the majority of results from the kitchen tap samples show metal concentrations below the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines values. The majority of the instances of non-compliance from both Cadia Holdings’ and the NSW EPA’s sampling programs showed that such instances of non-compliance were influenced by building and plumbing materials. \nA particulate characterization study, which was undertaken by the Australian government’s Australian Nuclear Science Technology Organisation (the “ANSTO”) and commissioned by Cadia Holdings in collaboration with the local community, assessed the PM2.5 dust contribution from Cadia to the regional air shed over a two-year period and concluded that Cadia contributed only a small percentage of soil particulate matter. In fact, soil was determined to be the least significant source of air pollution over the two-year period, contributing less than 10% to the total PM2.5 mass. The ANSTO study also determined that metals of concern recently identified by the community, such as lead, nickel, selenium and chromium, occurred at very low levels in the PM2.5 fraction and did not exceed any national standard. The report is part of a comprehensive suite of independent air and water quality investigations, including with respect to sampling of drinking water sources, air quality monitoring, dispersion modelling and lead fingerprinting, that have been or are being conducted to determine the source of metals within the local airshed and to assess any health risks to the local community, if any, from air emissions from the Cadia mine site. \nIn 2024, some local residents reported perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl Substances (“PFAS”) and other contaminants were allegedly being detected in the river catchment surrounding Cadia. The NSW EPA conducted sampling and the results show PFAS, particularly perfluorooctane sulfonate (“PFOS”) and perfluorooctanoic acid (“PFOA”), at several sites in the river catchment upstream and downstream from Cadia. The EPA will continue its sampling program in 2025.\nIn light of these developments at Cadia, there is a heightened level of community concern relating to the perceived impact of mining activities on the health of the community, and the condition of residential properties, located in proximity to Cadia. These \ndevelopments, including community complaints associated with our activities at Cadia could give rise to reputational harm, operational disruptions, increased regulatory scrutiny of mining activities or delays to project development.\nOur operations and projects are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy.\nClimate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy is expected to impact Newmont in a number of ways. Producing gold is an energy-intensive business, currently resulting in a significant carbon footprint. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy will require significant investment and may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. Depending on the nature, speed, focus and jurisdiction of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to the business. \nA number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change that are viewed as the result of emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels. At the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (“UNFCC”) held in Paris in 2015, the Paris Agreement was adopted which was intended to govern emission reductions beyond 2020, and subsequent UN Climate Change Conferences reaffirmed the commitments of the Paris Agreement, although in January 2025 President Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement. Newmont supports the UNFCC goal of limiting global warming to “well below 2oC” compared to pre-industrial levels and plans to transition its operations to meet this goal by 2030, with an aspiration of carbon neutrality by 2050. In 2020, Newmont also announced plans to invest in climate change initiatives in support of this goal, and additional material investments and capital expenditures will be required in order to meet our climate targets in the future. Inconsistent implementation or significant delay in the implementation of country-level policy is likely to increase the risk for future regulatory impacts and rapid shifts to low-carbon technologies, including renewable energy use. In addition, the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties 2024 (COP29) reported several challenges in the transition to renewable energy, including that many countries are not transitioning as quickly as needed, which could jeopardize their ability to meet climate targets. This may cause competition for renewable resources, which may lead to increased costs and reliability issues for Newmont.\nPolicy and regulatory risk related to actual and proposed changes in climate- and water-related laws, regulations and taxes developed to regulate the transition to a low-carbon economy may result in increased costs for our operations, venture partners and our suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations. Regulatory uncertainty may cause us to incur higher costs and lower economic returns than originally estimated for new development projects and operations, including closure reclamation obligations. For example, operational and capital expenses are expected to increase in order to meet renewable portfolio standard requirements from current costs over the next 10 years in Australia, Canada, Mexico and the U.S. Carbon taxes, fuel switching and the transition to cleaner purchased power and/or on-site renewable energy generation will require significant upfront capital expenditures and may also increase operating costs. As another example, the carbon tax in Canada of C$80/tonne of CO2 set to increase to C$170 by 2030, is impacting operating costs at our Canadian operations. We expect the potential for similar tax increases in other jurisdictions. Additionally, we do not maintain insurance policies against such climate-related risks or taxes. \nThe development and deployment of technological improvements or innovations will be required to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, which could result in write-offs and early retirement of existing assets, increased costs to adopt and deploy new practices and processing including planning and design for mines, development of alternative power sources, site level efficiencies and other capital investments. Our investments in these technologies may also expose us to legal, operational and reputational and other risks. The pace of development of such technologies may be inadequate, such technologies may be insufficient, and we may not be able to deploy such technologies at a commercial scale. We will also consider the limited use of carbon neutralization or offsets in the future for hard to abate emissions to assist in meeting our 2050 carbon neutral goal, and there may be an insufficient supply of offsets to achieve our goals. \nThere will be varied and complex market impacts due to climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. There will be shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, products and services in connection with evolving consumer and investor sentiments. Market perceptions of the mining sector, and, in particular, the role that certain metals will or will not play in the transition to a low-carbon economy remains uncertain. Potential financial impacts may include reduced investment in gold due to shifts in investor sentiment, increased production costs due to changing input prices, re-pricing of land valuation and assets, increased global competition for key materials needed for new technologies (lithium, copper, rare earth minerals used in solar technology, etc.), potential cost increases by insurers and lenders, and potential increases in taxation of the mining and metals sector. \nShould the mining and metals sector not respond quickly enough to meeting globally accepted science-based reductions required to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change, industry members may be subject to an increased risk of future climate litigation. In the U.S. and Canada, lawsuits have been filed against oil and gas companies to assign liability for climate-related impacts. Over time, litigation may also apply to other resource intensive sectors that fail to set and/or meet long-term reduction targets. While the Company is not currently subject to any lawsuits related to climate, no assurances can be provided that similar suits will not be brought in the future.\nOur ability to meet our climate strategy commitments and goals is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and relies on, among other things, our ability to invest in emissions reduction projects, our ability to implement operational changes and the availability of technology to achieve such commitments and goals. In addition, our ability to achieve our Scope 3 emissions targets is subject to the actions of entities not within our control. There is also a risk that some or all of the expected benefits of achieving such commitments and goals may fail to materialize within our anticipated time frames or at all. Investors and other stakeholders may not agree with our climate strategy commitments and goals, and we also face pressure from some in the investment community and certain public interest groups to limit the focus on ESG in our decision-making, arguing that ESG considerations do not relate to financial outcomes. A failure to meet our climate strategy commitments and goals and/or societal or investor expectations could result in damage to our reputation, decreased investor confidence and challenges in maintaining positive community relations, which can pose additional obstacles to our ability to conduct our operations and develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, and growth prospects. Further, the Company’s financing strategy is tied to its ESG commitments. The interest rate of Newmont’s $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.600% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2032 is linked to Newmont’s performance against key ESG commitments regarding 2030 emissions reduction targets and the representation of women in senior leadership roles target. As such, a failure to meet our climate and sustainability targets can result in further expense and impact our financial condition and ability to raise capital in the future. \nOur targets are uniquely tailored to our business, operations and capabilities, which do not easily lend to benchmarking against similar sustainability performance targets, and the related performance, of other companies. In addition, our climate-related targets are aspirational and subject to change, and reflect assumptions that are necessarily uncertain and may not be realized. We continue to review and revise our approach, and our targets may be further adjusted to align with future updates to our approach. The acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited on November 7, 2023, required that we recalculate the target baseline years and trailing years GHG emissions data pursuant to our publicly disclosed greenhouse gas emissions calculation methodology framework. Additional rebaselining in connection with our pending and future assets sales is also expected. We are continuing to review our targets and roadmap which may result in additional adjustments in the future. Additionally, the methodologies that we use to calculate our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions may change over time based upon changing industry standards, which may impact, positively or negatively, our ability to satisfy our targets, which could in turn adversely affect our reputation. Any major acquisition, merger, consolidation or divestiture or any series of related acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or divestitures, by or involving us, may impact our ability to achieve our targets and commitments. There is currently no generally accepted global definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise) of, nor market consensus as to what criteria qualify as, “green,” “social,” “sustainable” or “sustainability-linked” (and, in addition, the requirements of any such label may evolve from time to time), and therefore no assurance is or can be given that Newmont will meet any or all investor expectations.\nOur operations and projects are subject to a range of transitional and physical risks related to climate change.\nWe believe that climate change has the potential to impact the regions and sites in which Newmont operates, as well as the surrounding communities. Long-term potential physical climate risks include, but are not limited to, higher temperature in all regions, higher intensity storm events in all regions, impacts to annual precipitation depending upon the latitude and proximity of the site to oceans, and more extreme heat for sites near the equator or in Australia. Unusually dry climates can increase the chance of our operations being impacted by bush or forest fires.\nPhysical risks related to extreme weather events such as extreme precipitation, flooding, longer wet or dry seasons, flooding and drought conditions, increased temperatures, sea level rise, landslides, mine flooding, tsunami, geysers and outbursts, avalanches, landslides, wildfires or brushfires, or more severe storms may have financial implications for the business. In particular, the effects of changes in rainfall and intensities, water shortages and changing storm patterns have from time to time adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our costs, production levels and financial performance. For example, we experienced severe flooding in early 2017 at our Tanami mine in Australia which led to shutdown of operations for several weeks. In 2019, Tanami completed the construction of a natural gas pipeline to deliver fuel to the site to replace diesel fuel that is trucked to the site on roads that regularly flood due to increasing seasonal rainfall. Our operations in Suriname and Peru have also experienced delays in connection with the delivery of key production supplies due to temporary flooding. In 2019, Cadia experienced droughts, which resulted in temporary process plant water shortages and lower processed volumes. In 2023, the Éléonore mine in Quebec Canada had to shut down for several weeks due to prolonged wildfires conditions nearby, and Lihir’s operating and financial performance was impacted by lower feed grade reflecting a higher proportion of low grade material being processed in the second half of the year, following extreme rainfall that limited pit access and caused materials handling issues at the mine crusher. This followed prolonged drought conditions across the province of New Ireland in PNG, where Lihir is located, which resulted in limited raw water supply to Lihir. Floods and wildfires have also occurred near Cadia and Red Chris in recent years.\nThere is also the potential for disruption to transport routes associated with the distribution of our products. For example, Brucejack’s glacial access road, which is an essential means of entering that mine site, may be subject to a risk of thawing due to the potential for an increase in average temperatures, which may be related to climate change. Severe storm events can also result in unpermitted off-site discharges, slope instability, mine pit erosion and structural failures, tailings storage facility overtopping and other impacts, including water storage and treatment facility capacity considerations. Extended dry seasons or unseasonal dry conditions could exacerbate dust generation from operating activities that may require additional controls for continued operation or result in compliance breaches. Changing climatic conditions may also affect the likelihood of meeting closure success criteria and require adjustments to mine site rehabilitation and closure plans. The higher potential for extreme heat conditions may affect equipment \nefficiency. For additional information, see risk factors under the headings “Our operations and projects are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies and subject to water-related risks” and “Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical, geothermal and hydrogeological challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.”\nSuch events can temporarily slow or halt operations due to physical damage to assets, reduced worker productivity for safety protocols on site related to extreme temperatures or lightening events, worker aviation and bus transport to or from the site, and local or global supply route disruptions that may limit transport of essential materials, chemicals and supplies, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. Additional financial impacts could include increased capital or operating costs to increase water storage and treatment capacity, obtain or develop maintenance and monitoring technologies, increase resiliency of facilities and establish supplier climate resiliency and contingency plans. \nAn increase in frequency and duration of extreme weather conditions can be followed by extended power outages. Energy disruptions can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position due to production delays or additional costs to ensure business continuity through reliable sources of on-site power generation. Energy transmission and supply may be impacted by wildfires, such as those that occurred in Australia in 2020, which may interrupt electrical power transmission lines to mine sites, and that may pose risks to on-site facilities and energy generators, fuel dispensing systems and supplies. In jurisdictions that rely on purchased hydroelectric power, such as in Ghana and Peru, extreme drought and extended dry seasons may impact the electric utility’s water supplies needed to generate hydroelectric power purchased by the mine to run operations, which would result in higher costs and/or limit energy availability for continuity of operations as well as impact our environmental systems and processes. \nOur Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical, geothermal, and hydrogeological challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.\nNewmont and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical, geothermal and hydrogeological challenges due to the older age of certain of our mines and a trend toward mining of more complex deposits, the use of deeper and larger pits and the use of deep, bulk or selective underground mining techniques. This leads to higher pit walls, more complex underground environments and increased exposure to geotechnical instability and geothermal and hydrogeological impacts. As our operations are maturing, the open pits at many of our sites are getting deeper and we have experienced geotechnical failures (such as pit wall and slope failures) at some of our mines, including, without limitation, at our operations in Australia, Ghana, Peru, Canada, Colorado and at NGM, in Nevada. See also the risk factor under the heading “Mining companies are increasingly required to consider and provide benefits to the communities and countries in which they operate in order to maintain operations”.\nAdditionally, there are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the block cave mining methods applied at Cadia, in New South Wales, Australia. These risks include a cave not propagating as anticipated, excessive air gaps forming during the cave propagation, unplanned ground movement occurring due to changes in stresses released in the surrounding rock and larger or more frequent mining-induced seismicity than anticipated. Additionally, during cave establishment and propagation, higher levels of seismic activity, and higher likelihood of damage to excavations from seismic events, are expected. This has been observed during the cave establishment phase of Cadia’s PC2-3 project and is expected during the establishment of Cadia’s PC1-2 project in the coming years. Such seismic events and associated damage may require changes to the mining plan and upgrades to ground support systems, which could take several months. Large seismic events may also occur after cave establishment and propagation and during steady state caving, although the likelihood of this is lower. Excessive water ingress, disturbance and the presence of fine materials may also give rise to unplanned releases of material of varying properties and of water through drawbells. Cadia recorded sudden unplanned releases of both dry fine ore material and wet mud material through drawbells in 2023.\nIn addition, there are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the application of techniques used in the civil engineering industry for the stabilization of steep open pit slopes by Newmont at Lihir, which is located in Papua New Guinea. These risks include variation to technical models when compared to actual conditions, performance of reinforcement system in hot ground and delays with the execution of the civil works due to lack of experience with these techniques. The success of our operations depends, in part, on implementing engineering solutions to particular geotechnical, hydrogeological and geothermal conditions. For example, underground operations, large vertical shafts need to be excavated in order to provide ventilation to the underground environment, and sometimes these shafts are excavated using unsupported techniques such as raiseboring, whereby the walls of the shafts cannot be supported until the excavation is completed. If adverse and unexpected geotechnical and hydrogeological conditions are encountered, the shaft walls may become unstable. To prevent this type of incident occurring, thorough geotechnical and hydrogeological investigations and stability assessments are required and, if needed, alternate excavation locations or techniques need to be implemented. One such shaft wall failure incident occurred at Cadia in 2022, resulting in the need to abandon and backfill a shaft shortly after the completion of excavation to prevent further unravelling of the shaft wall and potential interruptions to other operations.\n Operations may also experience challenges to operating conditions, such as inundation, inrush of water or other materials, airblast and those relating to elevated temperatures (including management and discharge of hot water encountered in the underground workings). These risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties, production facilities, equipment or other properties, personal injury or death of employees or third parties, environmental damage, community outrage, delays in mining, increased production costs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Our operations are also subject to risks associated with a natural disaster, which include risk of tsunami, wildfires, mine flooding, geysers and outbursts, cyclones, avalanches and landslides. In \naddition, seismic activity may impact operations that are located in seismically active areas and subject to risks of earthquakes, such as Cadia and, with the related risks of tidal surge and tsunamis, Lihir. For instance, a large seismic event in 2017 impacted Cadia resulting in a temporary suspension of operations. Seismic activity has also been experienced at our Éléonore mine. Additionally, our Lihir operation is located within the Luise Caldera of the Luise Volcano which is located on the east coast of the Aniolam Island. The caldera is geothermally active in the form of hot springs and fumaroles.\nAdverse geotechnical, geothermal and hydrogeological conditions, including surface or underground fires, floods, droughts, geysers and outbursts, coastal erosion and landslides, avalanches, cyclones and pit wall failures, can be difficult to predict. Such conditions are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. Such events may not be detected in advance.\nIn addition, Newmont has both operational (active and inactive) and closed tailings storage facilities (\"TSFs\") in a variety of climatic and geographic settings. Annually, Newmont manages and disposes more than 150 million tonnes of milled rock slurry, referred to as tailings, that are placed within engineered, surface containment facilities, or placed as structural backfill paste in underground mines (e.g., Éléonore, Porcupine). Newmont has experienced seepage and/or localized instability at TSFs which required us to re-evaluate our emergency response systems and make modifications to our TSFs. Issues with TSFs, such as instability, failure and/or seepage could occur in the future, and Newmont conducts detailed risk assessments considering potential failure modes to support understanding and development of risk mitigation measures in accordance with the As Low As Reasonably Practicable principle. The failure of a TSF embankment or a water storage dam at one of our mine sites could cause severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. For example, in early 2019, the extractive industry experienced a large-scale tailings dam failure at an unaffiliated mine in Brazil, which resulted in numerous fatalities and caused extensive property, environmental and reputational damage. Recognizing this risk, Newmont continues to review and refine our existing practices and, as a member of the International Council on Mining & Metals (\"ICMM\"), commits to implementation of the GISTM. Work is underway to bring all TSFs in our portfolio into conformance with the GISTM by August 2025, and no assurance can be given that conformance will be achieved by such deadline. Conformance with the GISTM as well as improved understanding of our tailings risks and requisite mitigation remains on-going and has and may continue to result in increases to our estimated sustaining costs and closure costs for existing tailings facilities. Despite these efforts, no assurance can be given that TSF failure events will not occur in the future. \nA geotechnical failure of a TSF, dam, or pit slope could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, regulatory actions or penalties, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs and other impacts, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. For example, in December 2023 the Company temporarily suspended its processing operations at the now divested Telfer operations in Western Australia after cracking and sinkholes were detected on an internal embankment of the site’s TSF. Remediation works were completed in September 2024.\nA failure to safely resolve any unexpected problems relating to these conditions at a commercially reasonable cost may result in damage to infrastructure or equipment or injury to personnel and may adversely impact the Company’s operating results and financial position. See also the risk factors under the heading “We may experience increased costs or losses resulting from the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining” and “Damage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects” and “Our operations and projects are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.”\nOur operations and projects may be adversely affected by rising energy prices or energy shortages.\nOur mining operations and development projects require significant amounts of energy. Some of our operations are in remote locations requiring long-distance transmission of power or energy sources needed to generate power, and in some locations we compete with other companies for access to third party power generators or electrical supply networks. A disruption in the generation or transmission of energy, inadequate energy transmission infrastructure or the termination of any of our energy supply contracts could interrupt our energy supply and adversely affect our operations.\nOur principal energy sources are purchased electricity, diesel fuel, heavy fuel oil and natural gas. A variety of factors, including higher energy usage in emerging market economies, actual and proposed taxation of carbon emissions as well as concerns surrounding global conflicts, could result in increased demand or limited supply of energy and/or sharply escalating diesel fuel, natural gas and other energy prices. A reduction in Northern Territory natural gas production is a specific concern for Tanami’s short-term energy prices. Availability of renewable power sources or conflicting government regulations, such as the proposed reform of the energy market in Mexico, may have an impact on our ability to meet our reduction targets with a specific timeline. Changes in energy laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, restrictions on energy supply and increased energy prices could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flow.\nAs our operations move to reduce our GHG emissions, renewable power sources and technology at our operations will continue to be evaluated and implemented. Such transitions are likely to require capital expenditures and may result in additional costs. Certain of our operations may also become more dependent upon access to electrical power supply as certain mines advance projects \naimed at the electrification of large haulage fleets. The availability to access renewable power (with greater competition) and the readiness of technology to support decarbonization with the timeframe of the 2030 and 2050 targets remains subject to uncertainties, which could impact ability to achieve targets. See the risk factor above under the heading “Our operations and projects are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy”. \nOur operations and projects are dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies and subject to water-related risks. \nWe recognize the right to clean, safe water and that reliable water supplies are vital for hygiene, sanitation, livelihoods and the health of the environment. Water is also critical to our business, and the increasing pressure on water resources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our management approach. We have set annual water efficiency targets at each of our operating sites. Additionally, we aim to achieve ambitious long-term water stewardship actions, which integrate our operations and value chain and support collective management of water through external partnerships and collaborations. A failure to meet our water targets and/or societal or investor expectations could also result in damage to our reputation, decreased investor confidence and challenges in maintaining positive community relations, which can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects. \nAcross the globe, water is a shared and regulated resource. Newmont operates in areas where watersheds are under stress with limited supply, increasing population and water demand, and impacted water in various forms. Increasing pressure on water use may occur due to in-migration of communities and increased populations in proximity to our operations. Although each of our operations currently has sufficient water rights, claims and contracts to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings or community negotiations relating to our water rights, claims, contracts and uses. \nWater shortages and surplus may also result from weather or climate impacts outside of the Company’s control. Changes in the quantity of water, whether in excess or deficient amounts, may impact exploration and development activities, mining and processing operations, water management and treatment facilities, tailings storage facilities, closure and reclamation efforts, and may increase levels of dust land erosion and wildfires in dry conditions, and increase slope instability and the risk of water ingress in the case of prolonged wet conditions. \nOur Peñasquito and CC&V operations are situated in areas with high baseline water stress. CC&V in Colorado must purchase water supply in order to meet site needs and augmentation requirements. Peñasquito in Mexico takes its water supply from the Cedros Aquifer which has limited and declining yield as it is located in a dry and arid area that is prone to drought, and also is relied upon by nearby communities as a water supply for drinking water and agriculture. The water supply at Peñasquito is thus subject to a significant degree of regulatory and community scrutiny, and increased costs, and Peñasquito has made long-term commitments to provide safe community water supplies.\nSeasonality and changes in the levels of rainfall can also impact our operations. For example, in January 2023, our Tanami site in Australia experienced unexpected and significant rain resulting in flooding and road closure limiting our ability to get supplies to the site, causing mill backup and impacts to production. Similarly, at Boddington in Australia severe weather and heavy rainfall at Boddington caused delays and impacted productivity during the third quarter of 2021 and 2022. There is also a risk at Boddington that extended below average rainfall or the occurrence of drought in southwest Australia could impact raw water supply for the site. While we have incorporated systems to address the impact of the dry season and water shortages as part of our operating plans, we can make no assurances that those systems will be sufficient to address all shortages in water supply, which could result in production and processing interruptions.\nIn 2023, Lihir’s performance was impacted following extreme rainfall limiting pit access and causing material handling issues at the crushers. Lihir has also experienced reduced milling rates due to limited raw water supply to the plant driven by drought conditions experienced across the New Ireland Province in PNG. Lihir has progressed options to improve its water management resilience, including improving its internal water recycling and identifying additional water sources and storage options. In addition, Cadia has previously experienced water scarcity from drought conditions in 2019 which resulted in a reduction in water use to assist the Orange community response to the drought.\nIncreased precipitation and severe storm events may potentially impact tailings storage facilities in the future by exceeding water management capacity, overtopping the facility, and/or undermining the geotechnical stability of the structure. We have experienced impacts at various sites in recent years due to heavy rainfall and severe storms. For example, in 2022, Yanacocha experienced heavy rainfall, above average historical levels, which resulted in significant water balance stress and required active emergency management. Refer to Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading Environmental Matters - Minera Yanacocha S.R.L, for additional information. Increased amounts of water may also result in flooding of mine pits, maintenance and storage facilities; or may exceed current water management and treatment capacity to store and treat water, physical conditions resulting in an unintended overflow and discharge either on or off of the mine site property. See the risk factor above under the heading “Our operations and projects are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy” for additional information.\nOperations have identified seepage from infrastructure (tailings, waste rock and ore stockpiles) that may have an impact on water resources (groundwater and/or surface water); for example, seepage has been detected in the shallow and deep aquifers underlying the tailings facility at Red Chris. We are currently managing this risk through monitoring, collection and treatment systems. There is a risk that the seepage could have an impact on beneficial use of groundwater resulting in increased requirements for collection and treatment as well as the potential requirement to provide alternative water sources. See also the risk factor under the heading “Our Company and the mining industry are facing continued geotechnical, geothermal and hydrogeological challenges, which could adversely impact our production and profitability.”\nLaws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could limit our access to sufficient water resources in our operations, thus adversely affecting our operations. Additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements are becoming increasingly stringent and may continue to require additional water management activities and/or water treatment during operation and into closure. We are also seeing increasingly stringent regulations of surface and groundwater at a number of our sites resulting in increased monitoring and potentially the need for pump back systems and treatment in the future. New requirements and regulation have resulted or may result in increased costs and could negatively impact our operating costs and cash flows in the future.\nFor more information on the Company’s reclamation and remediation liabilities, refer to Notes 6 and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the risk factor under the heading “Mine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made.”\nOur operations and projects are subject to risks related to our relationships and/or agreements with local communities, including Indigenous Peoples, and laws for the protection of cultural heritage.\nThe Company’s relationships with the communities that are located near its operations or on whose land it operates are essential to the success of its existing operations, exploration activities and the construction and development of its projects. A failure to manage relationships with such communities may lead to local dissatisfaction which, in turn, may lead to interruptions to the Company’s operations, exploration activities and development projects. Specific challenges in community relations include community concerns over management of increased traffic, migratory workforces, environmental impacts and resource depletion, social, environmental and cultural heritage impacts, increasing expectations regarding the level of benefits that communities receive, benefits sharing with Indigenous peoples’ governments, concerns focused on the level of transparency regarding the payment of compensation and the provision of other benefits to affected landholders and the wider community. In particular, opposition by Indigenous communities to the Company’s activities may require modifications to or preclude operation or development of its projects or may require entry into additional agreements with Indigenous communities, which may result in additional costs. Newmont’s current and future operations are subject to a risk that one or more Indigenous communities in the locations in which we operate may oppose continued operation, further development or new development of its projects or operations. Claims and protests driven by such opposition may disrupt or delay activities, including permitting, at the Newmont’s operations and projects. The negotiation and review of agreements, including components such as business development, participation, co-management and compensation and other benefits, involve complicated and sensitive issues, associated expectations and often competing interests. The nature and subject matter of these negotiations may result in community unrest which, in some instances, may lead to interruptions in our exploration programs, operational activities or delays to project implementation or development.\nAdditionally, the evolving obligations of governments and Indigenous people under international, national and local legislation and international conventions pertaining to the rights of Indigenous people may impact Newmont’s operations and projects. For example, the Government of British Columbia, Canada has adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (2019) to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (\"UNDRIP\") in British Columbia, which may impact Red Chris and Brucejack. \nOur operations are also subject to laws and regulations that provide for the protection and management of cultural heritage in the jurisdictions in which we operate. For example, following the destruction of Indigenous heritage sites at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia in 2020 and the inquiry and reports issued by the Commonwealth Parliament Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia in 2021, mining companies have come under heightened scrutiny regarding cultural heritage management, including, for example, with respect to their governance and management processes and procedures around cultural heritage, engagement with Indigenous communities and protection of cultural landscapes. Although the parliamentary inquiry focused on Indigenous cultural heritage, laws to protect and manage cultural heritage also cover non-Indigenous (historic) heritage. Another example, in Western Australia, where Boddington is located, a new Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2021 (WA) came into force in 2023, replacing the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA) and introducing new offenses and increased penalties aimed at better protecting Aboriginal cultural heritage in Western Australia. In 2023, the WA Premier announced that the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2021 (WA) will be completely repealed, with an amended Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA) replacing it. \nFurther, cultural heritage in PNG is protected under the National Cultural Property (Preservation) Act 1965 (PNG). The main government bodies responsible for enforcing this Act are the National Museum and Art Gallery of PNG and the National Cultural Commission. The Lihir operation has a culturally significant site called the Ailaya Rock, located near the mining operations. Significant civil reinforcement work is being undertaken to protect the surrounding area's structural integrity. A failure to maintain the integrity of the surrounding area could inadvertently damage the site, resulting in impacts to community relations and reputation.\nNewmont’s operations could inadvertently disturb protected cultural heritage assets, resulting in international scrutiny by investors and non-governmental organizations, negative impact on stockholder value, compensation and/or offset claims, increased costs to projects and operations, delays impacting construction or production or project development, court action or other legal proceedings and lasting reputational damage. \nRisks Related to the Jurisdictions in Which We Operate\nOur operations and projects are subject to risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions.\nExploration, development, production and mine closure activities are subject to regional, political, economic, community and other risks of doing business in multiple jurisdictions, including:\n•Potential instability of foreign governments and changes in government policies, including relating to or in response to changes of U.S. laws or foreign policies;\n•Expropriation or nationalization of property;\n•Restrictions on the ability to pay dividends offshore or to otherwise repatriate funds;\n•Restrictions on the ability of local operating companies to sell gold and other metals offshore for U.S. dollars, or on the ability of such companies to hold U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies in offshore bank accounts;\n•Import and export regulations, including restrictions on the export of gold, copper, silver, lead and/or zinc;\n•Disadvantages relating to submission to the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitration panels or enforcement or appeals of judgments at foreign courts or arbitration panels against a sovereign nation within its own territory;\n•Royalty and tax increases or claims, including retroactive increases and claims and requests to renegotiate terms of existing investment agreements, contracts of work, leases, royalties and taxes, by governmental entities, including such increases, claims and/or requests by the governments of Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Fiji, Ghana, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Suriname, the State of Colorado and the State of Nevada in the U.S.;\n•Changes in laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including in changes resulting from changes in political administrations;\n•Risk of increased taxation related to impacts to government revenue as a result of challenging socioeconomic conditions, including recessions and/or in connection with heath and community emergencies, such as pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks (including COVID-19 and related variants), and climate events;\n•Fines, fees, and sanctions imposed for failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n•Risk of loss due to inability to access our properties or operations;\n•Other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, including risks inherent in contracts with government owned entities such as unilateral cancellation or renegotiation of contracts, licenses or other mining rights;\n•Delays in obtaining or renewing, or the inability to obtain, maintain or renew, necessary governmental permits, mining or operating leases and other agreements and/or approvals;\n•Risk of loss due to civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism;\n•Claims for increased mineral royalties or ownership interests by local or Indigenous communities;\n•Increased expectations of local Indigenous communities for profit or other benefit sharing;\n•Risk of loss due to criminal activities such as trespass, blockade, local artisanal or illegal mining, organized crime by drug cartels, theft and vandalism;\n•Delays in obtaining or renewing collective bargaining or certain labor agreements, workforce unionization, or demand for profit sharing;\n•Disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to the rigorous laws and regulations of the U.S. or other jurisdictions, including without limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Dodd-Frank Act;\n•Increases in training and other costs and challenges relating to requirements by governmental entities to employ the nationals of the country in which a particular operation is located;\n•Increased financing costs;\n•Currency fluctuations, particularly in countries with high inflation;\n•Foreign exchange controls;\n•Increases in costs relating to, or restrictions or prohibitions on, the use of ports for concentrate storage and shipping, such as in relation to our Boddington operation where use of alternative ports is not currently economical, or in relation to our ability to procure economically feasible ports for developing projects;\n•Risk of disruption, damage or failure of information technology systems, and risk of loss and operational delays due to impacts to operational technology systems, such as due to cyber-attacks, malicious software computer viruses, security breaches, design failures and natural disasters;\n•Risk of loss due to disease, such as malaria or the zika virus, and other potential medical endemic or pandemic issues, such as Ebola or COVID-19, as a result of the potential related impact to employees, disruption to operations, supply chain delays, trade restrictions and impact on economic activity in affected countries or regions; and\n•Disadvantage and risk of loss due to the limitations of certain local health systems and infrastructure to contain diseases and potential endemic health issues.\nConsequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be affected by these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, some of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nNew or changing legislation and tax risks in certain operating jurisdictions could negatively affect us.\nWe have operations and conduct business in a number of jurisdictions, which may increase our susceptibility to sudden tax changes. For instance, a 12% export duty was imposed by the Argentina government in 2018, revised down to 8% thereafter, however, with the election of new government in 2023, the rate is now currently 0%. The state of New South Wales, Australia, passed 2023 legislation that imposes an increased stamp duty which materially affected the Newcrest transaction. Also in Australia, the Debt Deduction Creation Rules, introduced during 2024 and which will first apply to the 2025 year, could have the potential to limit the tax deductibility of intercompany interest expense. In the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, environmental taxes became effective in 2017 with little clarity on how the taxes are to be calculated. An ecological tax agreement was ratified in 2021 which provides clarity for 2021 to 2024, after which, the Company, along with other companies in the State of Zacatecas, will need to engage with governmental authorities to understand how the environmental tax would be levied year-over-year. Also, in Mexico, a 2021 tax reform bill proposed federal fees on revenue generated from mining which could impact our operations if passed. Furthermore, a new Economic Plan for 2022 (the \"Proposal\") was enacted. While the changes under the Proposal are not substantive in nature (in the sense that they do not create new taxes or increase applicable rates), they may increase the future cost of our compliance and pose additional uncertainties in application of the law. Further, the Mexican government has increased the Mining Tax rate from 7.5% to 8.5% effective on January 1, 2025. In the United States, at the federal and state level, regulatory changes which may be implemented in the area of tax reform remain uncertain and may adversely affect companies in the mining sector. For example, NGM could be impacted by the resolutions brought to the State of Nevada Legislature to amend the State Constitution to increase mining taxes. An example of this was the passing of Assembly Bill 495 in 2021 that results in a new excise tax on mining companies engaged in the business of extracting gold and silver in the state of Nevada. In 2024, Pillar II has been enacted in a number of countries. The Pillar II agreement was signed by 138 countries with the intent to equalize corporate tax around the world by implementing a global minimum tax of 15%. As Newmont primarily does business in jurisdictions with a tax rate greater than 15%, the Company does not anticipate a material impact to its financial statements. A number of changes in the laws, regulations and policies in PNG have recently been proposed or are currently being considered. See the risk factor under the heading “Our operations at Lihir and project at Wafi-Golpu in PNG are subject to political and regulatory risks and other uncertainties”. Taxation laws and other regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate are complex, subject to varying interpretations and applications by the relevant tax authorities and subject to changes and revisions in the ordinary course. It is difficult to predict whether proposed changes to regulations will be passed or to what extent they will impact the Company. Any additional and/or unexpected taxes imposed on us could have a material and adverse impact on our Company. See also the risk factor under the heading “Our operations and projects are subject to a range of risks related to transitioning the business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations for operating in a low-carbon economy” for a discussion of uncertainties and potential tax increases in connection with climate change considerations. \nChanges in mining or investment policies or shifts in political and social attitudes in the jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect our operations or profitability.\nOur operations may be affected in a number of ways by laws and regulations related, but not limited to: restrictions on production; price controls; export controls; import restrictions, such as restrictions applicable to, among other things, equipment, services and supplies, currency remittance, income taxes, expropriation of property, foreign investment, maintenance of mineral, mining, or surface land tenure, environmental legislation, land use, surface land access, land claims of local communities, water use, and mine safety. Failure to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to applying for and maintaining land and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as partners with carried or other interests, any of which may adversely affect our operations or profitability.\nIn addition, when governments struggle with deficits and concerns over the potential and actual effects of depressed economic conditions (which occurred in the past in connection with COVID-19 impacts), many of them have in the past, and may in the future, target the mining and metals sector in order to raise revenue. Governments are continually assessing the fiscal terms of the economic rent for a mining company to exploit resources in their countries. Numerous countries have implemented changes to their \nmining regimes that reflect increased government control over or participation in the mining sector, including, but not limited to, changes of law affecting foreign ownership and takeovers, mandatory government participation in mining enterprises, taxation and royalties, working conditions, rates of exchange, exchange controls, exploration licensing, export duties, requirements to sell to the government, repatriation of income or return of capital, environmental protection, as well as requirements intended to boost the local economy, including usage of local goods and employment of local and community staff or contractors, among other benefits to be provided to local residents. The effects of the various requirements and uncertainties related to the economic risks of operating in foreign jurisdictions cannot be accurately predicted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Some concern exists with respect to investments in parts of the world where civil unrest, war, nationalist movements, political violence or economic crises are possible. These countries may also pose heightened risks of expropriation of assets, business interruption, increased taxation or unilateral modification of concessions and contracts. We do not maintain insurance policies against political risk. Occurrence of events for which we are not insured may affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur operations at Yanacocha and projects in Peru are subject to political and social unrest risks.\nMinera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”), including the mining operations at Yanacocha and the Conga project in Peru, has been the target of local political and community protests, some of which blocked the road between the Yanacocha mine and Conga project complexes and the City of Cajamarca in Peru and resulted in vandalism and equipment damage. While recent roadblocks and protests have diminished, and there is focus on local political activism and labor disputes, we cannot predict whether similar or more significant incidents will occur in the future. The recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect the continued operation of Yanacocha and other projects in the area.\nConstruction activities on our Conga project were suspended in 2011, at the request of Peru’s central government following protests in Cajamarca by anti-mining activists led by the regional president. Based on the Company's internal project portfolio evaluation process, we have reprioritized other projects ahead of the Conga project, and therefore do not anticipate developing Conga in the next ten years. As a result, the Conga project is currently in care and maintenance and we will continue to evaluate long-term options to progress development of the Conga project. Should the Company be unable to develop the Conga project or conclude that future development is not in the best interest of the business, a future impairment charge may result.\nThe prior Central Government of Peru supported responsible mining as a vehicle for the growth and future development of Peru. However, following the presidential election in 2021, there has been considerable political unrest in Peru. In a close and contested election, Pedro Castillo was declared the president-elect of Peru in July 2021, which resulted in a period of protests, unrest and uncertainty around the political and social environment in Peru and Cajamarca. Amidst political turmoil and instability, Castillo made numerous changes to his cabinet, including ministers of mining, work and interior, and of prime ministers. Castillo was ultimately removed from office in late 2022 due to his attempt to dissolve the legislative body and install an emergency government. Political turmoil and division has continued in Peru as protest and demonstrations against the current President Dina Boluarte escalated in early 2023 resulting in clashes with security forces and violence.\nThe current Central Government’s legislative priorities and support for responsible mining in Peru remains uncertain. Previous regional governments of Cajamarca and other political parties actively opposed certain mining projects in the past, including by protests, community demands and road blockages, which may occur again in the future. We are unable to predict the positions that will be taken by the Central or regional government and neighboring communities in the future and whether such positions or changes in law will affect current operations and new projects in Peru. Risks related to mining and foreign investment under the new administration include, without limitation, risks to mineral, mining and surface, land tenure and permitting, increased taxes and royalties, nationalization of mining assets and increased labor regulations, environmental and other regulatory requirements. Any change in government positions or laws on these issues could adversely affect the assets and operations of Yanacocha or other projects in Peru, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, the inability to operate or expand at Yanacocha could have an adverse impact on our growth and production in the region. See also the risk factor under the heading “Mine closure, reclamation and remediation costs for environmental liabilities may exceed the provisions we have made” and refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the Company’s interest in Yanacocha.\nOur Merian operation in Suriname is subject to political, security and economic risks.\nWe hold a 75% interest in the Merian gold mine (“Merian”) in the mid-eastern part of Suriname. Suriname has experienced political instability and uncertainty in the past which may continue in future years. Suriname is faced with high debts to foreign creditors, significant inflation rates and has experienced a hyperinflationary economy. Significant devaluation of the Surinamese dollar against the U.S. dollar in recent years has resulted in an increase of the prices of certain goods and services within Suriname, including without limitation, the price of fuel, which had been subsidized by successive governments. The government of Suriname recently passed a new law to introduce Value Added Tax, which came into effect on January 1, 2023 and has drastically increased the cost of living and negatively impacts the purchasing power of the residents of Suriname, including our employees. These impacts and negative economic trends can cause social unrest, which may present risks for our operations in Suriname. \nOperations and development in Suriname are governed by a mineral agreement with the Republic of Suriname. The mineral agreement was approved by parliament and requires approval by parliament to change. However, in 2021, the government made requests for prepayment of taxes and special solidarity payments in light of budgetary concerns, it is possible that the government may \nrequest changes to the mineral agreement in the future. While the government is generally considered by the Company to be mining friendly, it is possible that the current or future government may adopt substantially different policies, make changes in taxation treatment or regulations, take arbitrary action which might halt operations, increase costs, or otherwise impact mining and exploration rights and/or permits, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company's future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nThe government of Suriname previously exercised an option to participate in a fully-funded 25 percent equity ownership stake in Merian. Suriname manages its participation through Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. (“Staatsolie”), a Surinamese corporation with the Republic of Suriname as sole stockholder. If Staatsolie does not have sufficient funds or borrowing ability to make their capital commitments in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement, our operations in Suriname could be impacted. See the risk factor under the heading “Future funding requirements may affect our business, our ability to pay cash dividends or our ability to engage in share repurchase transactions.” Earlier in this section under “Risks Related to Our Business”.\nOur operations at Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana are subject to political, economic and other risks.\nNewmont operates in Ghana pursuant to a Revised Investment Agreement ratified by Ghana’s Parliament in 2015, which established a fixed fiscal and legal regime, including fixed royalty and tax rates, for Newmont operations in Ghana. The financial and tax stability periods established by such agreements expire as early as 2025 for Ahafo and 2027 for Akyem. The tenure of the Revised Investments Agreement is linked to the mining leases. The Akyem mining leases, which were due to expire in January 2025, were renewed in September 2024 and are currently pending ratification in Parliament. The Republic of Ghana has experienced worsening socioeconomic conditions in recent years. The Ghanaian cedi has experienced significant depreciation with inflation accelerating to 54.1% at the end of 2022. Ghana’s credit rating worsened to speculative grade, at near default to default levels, as the Ghanaian Finance Ministry announced suspension of debt service payments in December 2022 on the majority of its external debt, including commercial and bilateral loans, and that Ghana was seeking to restructure its debt. Efforts in early 2023 to put in place a domestic debt exchange program have faced setbacks from pension funds and by individual bond holders leading to amended terms. Continued economic recession and/or unfavorable macroeconomic indicators have also resulted in pressures from the Government of Ghana to obtain more revenue and benefits from mining companies on the back of anti-mining sentiment and perceived inequities that the industry is not contributing its fair share. To address budgetary deficits, the Government of Ghana initiated measures to generate additional revenue from the mining industry and other sectors of the economy as it attempted to increase revenue collection through various tax audits and investigations, proposed new fees, increased revenue and tax initiatives and other vehicles, such as the Growth and Sustainability Levy, and in 2024, Emissions Levy and VAT on electricity. While the second half of 2023 experienced an improvement in the macroeconomic situation with inflation reducing to 23.2% in December 2023 and 23.8% in December 2024, the Ghanaian cedi being relatively stable, with support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in early 2024, significant economic risks remain. A new government was inaugurated on January 7, 2025 after a relatively peaceful election. Other risks include impacts to supply chain, restrictions and local procurement requirements under local content regulations. On the January 8, 2025 in the Daily Graphic newspaper, the Minerals Commission published the 6th edition of the Local Procurement List which includes a prohibition on mining by mining lease holders and requiring surface mining operations to be outsourced to companies with 100% Ghanaian stockholders and directors and underground operations to be outsourced to companies with 50% Ghanaian stockholders and directors. The Ghana Chamber of Mines, of which Newmont is a member, is reviewing the list and is to engage the government on this prohibition on owner mining. Additionally, there is a risk of increase in key commodity prices, more restrictive local banking requirements including requirements for repatriation of proceeds to banks domiciled in Ghana, limitations on capacity of banks to provide reclamation bonds, requests for further local employment requirements, requests for contract renegotiation and increases in contract rates and other costs. The government may grant artisanal mining rights or alternative mining rights, such as sand and gravel, in locations in which the Company has tenure rights, but no active operations, impacting the Company’s non-operational land positions. Economic setbacks and anti-mining sentiment can also result in an increase in community frustration and friction with artisanal small-scale mining resulting in conflicts, which can negatively impact our operations in Ghana.\nOur operations in Argentina are susceptible to risk as a result of economic and political instability in Argentina and labor unrest.\nWith the election of a new President at the end of 2023, the economic environment in Argentina has experienced stabilization during 2024. Although inflation was drastically reduced, it still is at a high level and will remain as a challenge for 2025. There continue to be risks relating to the uncertain and unpredictable political and economic environment in Argentina, especially at the provincial level in Santa Cruz where our Cerro Negro mine is located. Argentina’s central bank instituted a number of foreign currency controls in an effort to stabilize the local currency. Although some flexibility has been introduced, major restrictions and controls remain in place. For information on Argentina’s foreign currency controls and their effect on our operations, see the section titled “Foreign Currency Exchange Rates” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Maintaining operating revenues in Argentine pesos could expose us to the risks of peso devaluation and high domestic inflation. \nIn recent years, we experienced work stoppages by miners represented by unions at the Cerro Negro Mine. Disruptions may arise again in the future with the unions at the Cerro Negro mine that could adversely affect access to, and operations at, the Cerro Negro Mine. For more information see the risk factor under the heading “Our business depends on good relations with our employees.”\nOur operations at Lihir and project at Wafi-Golpu in PNG are subject to political and regulatory risks and other uncertainties.\nOur Lihir operation, which comprises an open pit mine that produces gold doré, is located on the island of Aniolam, PNG. We also hold a 50% interest in a joint venture that owns the Wafi-Golpu exploration project (“Wafi-Golpu” and such joint venture, “WGJV”), which is located in the province of Morobe, PNG. The current PNG administration, led by Prime Minister James Marape, has stated that it wants to increase benefits for PNG from extractive projects. Potential policy changes could include introducing a new production sharing regime for minerals and/or oil/gas, amending or replacing the PNG Mining Act of 1992, introducing domestic processing/refining requirements, changing the level and manner of local equity participation in projects and introducing new taxation regimes, banking and foreign exchange controls and/or controls pertaining to the holding of cash and remittance of profits and capital to parent companies. Any such change could impact our operating results and financial condition.\nIn 2020, the PNG Government announced that the special mining lease (\"SML\") for the Porgera mining operation (a major mining operation in PNG which was owned and operated by the Porgera JV and not Newmont) would not be renewed. It subsequently amended the Mining Act and issued a new SML for Porgera to Kumul Mineral Holdings Limited (a State-owned company). Since taking this decision, the PNG Government has been working with the Porgera JV participants and other key stakeholders to establish new arrangements for restarting and operating Porgera. During 2023, the parties signed various agreements and the Government passed specific enabling legislation for a restart of operations at Porgera under new commercial terms. The restart occurred in December 2023. The PNG Government has stated that the decision not to renew the Porgera SML is specifically related to environmental damages claims and resettlement at the Porgera mine and has no bearing on any other operations, including Lihir, or advanced exploration projects, including Wafi-Golpu.\nIn 2020, the PNG government prepared and submitted to the National Parliament of PNG (the “PNG Parliament”) a proposed new organic law to introduce a production sharing regime for the mining sector. The proposed organic law will require the approval of a two thirds majority of the PNG Parliament and, if passed in its current proposed form, purports to transfer ownership of minerals from the State of PNG to state-owned entities who would then be responsible for negotiating mineral production sharing arrangements. As currently drafted, the bill containing the proposed organic law will not apply to Lihir, but could potentially apply to Wafi-Golpu if a mining lease or mining development contract is not in place before the effective date for the proposed organic law. The bill is yet to be debated in the PNG Parliament. In December 2024 Prime Minister Marape reaffirmed the Government’s intention to reform PNG’s mining and oil/gas laws as part of PNG’s 50th anniversary of independence in 2025 and indicated a production sharing regime for minerals and/or oil/gas remains under consideration.\nOn October 29, 2021, Prime Minister Marape announced proposed legislation which, if enacted, would regulate the export of gold from PNG and require that mining companies operating in PNG refine gold with a new national mint. At this stage, it is unclear whether this proposed legislation will become law and, if so, when it would take effect. In addition, in June 2023, the PNG government released a new national gold bullion policy setting out the government’s objective of establishing a domestic gold bullion program to refine gold, hold gold reserves and eventually enter into trading in the world gold market. It is unclear when or how the new national gold bullion policy will be implemented, and how the policy will interact with the legislation proposed in 2021. Under the terms of the Lihir mining development contract, we may be required to refine a portion of our Lihir gold production within PNG if certain quality and security requirements are met and the terms offered are commercially competitive, but it is otherwise free to enter into arms’ length refining contracts with refineries outside of PNG.\nThe PNG government has also announced that it is considering replacing the current PNG Income Tax Act with a new Income Tax Act (the “NITA”) with limited consultation undertaken to date. The latest draft legislation provides that the NITA will come into force from January 1, 2026, with further consultation and amendments expected during 2025. It remains uncertain as to whether existing tax attributes of Lihir and Wafi-Golpu will be transitioned under the new law due to the lack of key regulations and other key ancillary pieces of legislation. Any adverse changes to the tax laws and regulations will affect Lihir because its Mining Development Contract does not provide protection against income tax law change. Such changes may also affect Wafi-Golpu depending on the terms of any project agreements that may be entered into with the PNG Government.\nThere is also the potential for legal challenges to the Wafi-Golpu permitting process as it progresses towards completion, including by PNG provincial governments, landowner groups and civil society organizations. For example, in March 2021 and December 2022, the governor of Morobe Province and certain residents of the surrounding areas of Wafi-Golpu, respectively, commenced judicial review applications against the State of PNG, challenging the December 2020 grant of the environmental permit for Wafi-Golpu. Both reviews are still to be heard and determined. Any such legal challenges may adversely impact the Wafi-Golpu permitting process. In addition, WGJV is currently engaging with the State of PNG to progress the permitting of Wafi-Golpu and has commenced discussions relating to its application for a special mining lease, which was submitted to the PNG Mineral Resources Authority in 2016. In April 2023, WGJV signed a Framework Memorandum of Understanding with the State of PNG, which confirmed the parties’ intent to proceed with the project at Wafi-Golpu, subject to finalizing the permitting process and approvals of the boards of both Newcrest (now Newmont) and Harmony Gold, and progress toward signing a mining development contract, which is a prerequisite to granting a special mining lease. The timing for completing the discussions is uncertain and there is no assurance of the outcomes.\nChanges in the laws, regulations and policies described above, or to the manner in which they are interpreted or applied to us, may also adversely impact our ability to extend the Lihir special mining lease upon its expiration in 2035.\nOur operations and projects in Canada are subject to legal and regulatory risks and other uncertainties in connection with claims and challenges by Indigenous groups.\nFirst Nations have made claims in respect of Indigenous rights and title to substantial portions of land and water across Canada, which could impact our exploration projects, and operations at Red Chris, Porcupine, Musselwhite, Éléonore and Brucejack. Some of these claims are made outside of treaty and other processes. The effect of such claims on any particular area of land will not be determinable until the exact nature of historical use, occupancy and rights to such property have been clarified, whether by a decision of the Canadian courts or definition in a treaty or otherwise. First Nations throughout Canada are seeking settlements with respect to these claims, including compensation from governments, and are seeking rights to regulate activities by companies within their traditional territories. The effect of these claims cannot be estimated at this time. The federal and provincial governments in Canada have been seeking to negotiate settlements with respective groups in order to resolve many of these claims, and the government routinely delegates procedural aspects of its duty to consult the First Nations to project proponents, particularly with respect to the permitting process. For example, a Statement of Claim filed in November 2024 asserts that resumption of open pit mining at the Pamour mine in Timmins, Ontario, Canada would be without proper consultation or consideration of the cumulative impacts of Taykwa Tagamou Nation's traditional territory and Aboriginal rights, and as such, the associated environmental permits previously issued by the Ontario government with respect to Pamour ought to be revoked (see Note 25 - Commitments and contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding this claim).\nWe hold a 70% interest in the Red Chris operation, which comprises an open pit mine that produces gold, copper and silver concentrate, located in British Columbia, Canada. Our Brucejack operation, which comprises an underground mine that produces gold/silver doré and flotation concentrate and hosts the Valley of the Kings high-grade gold deposit, is also located in British Columbia, Canada. In British Columbia, as well as in Canada more generally, the nature and extent of Indigenous rights and title remains the subject of active debate, claims and litigation issues surrounding Indigenous title and rights remain ongoing.\nIn addition, the government of British Columbia has adopted the UNDRIP and committed to implement UNDRIP in British Columbia, with federal government following suit in 2021 where UNDRIP became federal law in 2021. The provincial and federal legislations commits to systematically review the province’s laws for alignment with UNDRIP principles, while also encouraging new agreements with Indigenous groups that are intended to address outstanding governance questions around the nature of Indigenous rights and title interests in Canada and in British Columbia. In November 2023 a consent-based decision making agreement under section 7 of the UNDRIP was entered into between the government of British Columbia and the Tahltan Central Government (“TCG”) of the Tahltan Nation outlining the process for consent-based decision making for the review of substantial changes to the environmental assessment certificate for the Red Chris mine. The processes outlined in this agreement will apply to changes to the Red Chris environmental assessment certificate relating to the proposed development and operation of the Red Chris block cave mine. Failure or delays in implementing the agreement or to obtain prior informed consent of the TCG may impact the proposed development of the Red Chris block cave mine.\nAdditionally, the government of British Columbia has committed to reform the Mineral Tenure Act, which governs the acquisition and holding of mineral tenures in British Columbia, in consultation with First Nations and First Nation organizations. This follows challenges by several First Nations in British Columbia against the “free entry” mineral staking regime in the province and a September 2023 Supreme Court of British Columbia decision that held that the province of British Columbia has a duty to consult Indigenous groups when registering mineral claims under the Mineral Tenure Act within their traditional territories. As this reform work remains on-going, the impacts of these developments on the acquisition and renewal of mineral tenures in British Columbia are not yet known.\nRisks Related to Our Workforce\nOur business depends on good relations with our employees.\nProduction at our mines is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. Due to union activities or other employee actions, we could experience labor disputes, work stops or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us. For example, in recent years, there have been work stoppages by miners represented by unions at our Peñasquito, Cerro Negro and Merian mines, which have disrupted operations. Certain regions in which we operate, including Central and Latin America, have witnessed notable trends in labor relations, including increasing emphasis on workers' rights and labor protections. Governments and civil society organizations have been advocating for improved labor standards, wages and working conditions, leading to the implementation of new labor laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions. Additionally, collective bargaining has gained prominence as a means to negotiate and secure favorable terms for workers.\nAt December 31, 2024, various unions represented approximately 30.4% of our employee workforce worldwide. In 2022, Newmont implemented a new employment model in Ghana converting permanent employees into two-year fixed term contracts. Although 99.8% of eligible employees accepted the new fixed term contract and, received severance for their years of service, following implementation of the new employment model, the two unions requested and were granted new collective bargaining certificates from Ghana’s Chief Labor Officer for bargaining rights for the class of workers to be represented. The two unions are litigating for bargaining rights to be determined based on verification of membership numbers resulting in targeted efforts to increase \nmembership and a writ of summons was issued by the Ghana Mine Workers Union and the suit is ongoing. In Peru, our two labor agreements expire in 2026 and 2027. In Suriname, the collective bargaining with the union for our Merian mine was entered into in 2023, and will expire in 2025. In Argentina where there are three district unions; one union has an expired agreement and another has an agreement in place until 2024. In Timmins, Ontario, we renegotiated a five-year collective bargaining agreement for our Porcupine mine with the United Steelworkers Union in October 2023, which will be in effect through October 2028. In Mexico, following negotiations, we reached a profit sharing agreement in 2022 whereby union represented workforce will participate in uncapped profit-sharing bonus up to 10%, which will result in increased labor costs in the future. A collective bargaining agreement expired in 2024 and in October 2024 Newmont Peñasquito and the National Union of Mining, Metallurgical, Steel, and Similar Workers of Mexico (the Union) agreed on a new Collective Bargain Agreement (CBA) for 2024-2026, reflecting the mutual commitment of all parties. Red Chris has a unionized workforce and has a collective agreement in place from April 2023 until April 2025. One provision of the Red Chris Collective Bargaining Agreement (“CBA”) is still being resolved through arbitration. There is an existing employee enterprise agreement in place at Cadia with a nominal expiry date in 2025. A failure to successfully enter into new contracts or resolve ongoing union complaints could result in future labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Future disputes at the Company’s operations, projects or joint ventures may not be resolved without disruptions.\nOur Peñasquito operation in Mexico is subject to social, political, regulatory, and economic risks.\nOur Peñasquito operation has in the past, and may in the future, be affected significantly and adversely by social, political, regulatory, or economic developments in Mexico. A wide range of general and industry-specific Mexican federal and state environmental laws and regulations apply to our operations. These laws and regulations are often difficult and costly to comply with and carry substantial penalties for non-compliance. For example, in the State of Zacatecas, Mexico, environmental taxes became effective in 2017 with little clarity on how the taxes are to be calculated. An ecological tax agreement was ratified in 2021 which provides clarity for 2021 to 2024, after which, the Company, along with other companies in the State of Zacatecas, will need to engage with governmental authorities to understand how the environmental tax would be levied year-over-year. Additionally, in May 2023, the Mexican government published several amendments to laws relating to the country's mining industry, which includes changes to Mexico's Mining Law, National Waters Law, General Law of Ecological Equilibrium and Environmental Protection and General Law for the Prevention and Integral Handling of Wastes (“Mining Reform”). The Mining Reform is expected to add significant uncertainty for foreign investors in Mexico and companies operating in the mining sector, including Newmont. As a result of the Mining Reform, we expect that it will be more difficult for us to access/maintain rights to land and water, thereby negatively impacting our mining activities within Mexico, raising concerns around exploration programs, security of concessions, and out of cycle community negotiations. If political and regulatory trends continue in a manner that is increasingly less supportive of mining, it can have an adverse impact on our operations and financial results. On June, 2023, the Company filed an injunction (Amparo) against the reforms, and was served with a provisional suspension to the applicability of several provisions of the Mining Reform on January 2024. Additionally, in February 2024, Mexico's president presented before parliament a series of new constitutional reforms. The proposed reforms include a possible ban on the granting of open pit mining concessions and banning activities related to the exploration, exploitation, benefit or use of minerals or metals using open pit mining methods, and potential limitations on water concessions in certain areas of the country. If proposed reforms were to be enacted it could materially impact our exploration activities and operations at Peñasquito and adversely impact financial results.\nProduction at our Peñasquito operation is dependent upon the efforts of our employees and, consequently, our maintenance of good relationships with our employees. In recent years, we have had several disputes with the National Union of Mine and Metal Workers of the Mexican Republic (“the Union”). Following negotiations in 2022, Newmont and the Union reached a CBA in June 2022 whereby Union represented workforce will participate in uncapped profit-sharing bonus up to 10%, which resulted in increased labor costs. In June 2023, the Union made claims regarding violations of legal regulations and labor agreements (which the Company refuted) and notified the Company of a strike action demanding an increase in the uncapped profit-sharing benefit provided for in the CBA that represented a 100 percent increase equivalent to a 20 percent instead of 10 percent profit-sharing. The Company urged the Union to abide by the mutually agreed CBA and engaged in dialogue with the Union and the government, but the disagreement remained unresolved until October 2023 when the parties reached a definitive agreement to end the strike. Per the agreement, the Company paid Peñasquito workers a fixed amount equivalent to approximately 60% of wages for the duration of the strike, and an additional bonus of two months’ wages to be paid out in the second quarter of 2024, given that the Peñasquito mine reported no profit in 2023 as a consequence of the strike. Additionally, as a part of a separate annual negotiation under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Company agreed to an annual salary increase of 8% effective as of August 1, 2023, which is in line with the Mexican mining industry wage increases for 2023. In October 2024, Newmont Peñasquito and the Union agreed on a new CBA for 2024-2026, reflecting the mutual commitment of all parties.\nFrom June 2023 to October 2023, Minera Peñasquito suspended operations, which negatively impacted production and revenue. Any failure to successfully resolve future union complaints could result in additional work stoppages and/or other future disruptions in production and labor issues that could adversely affect our operations and financial performance and our ability to achieve expected results and guidance. \nA deterioration in Mexico’s economy, social instability, political unrest, or other adverse social developments in Mexico could also adversely affect operating results at Peñasquito, as well as the safety and security of the site and workforce. For example, in recent years, Mexico has experienced a period of increasing criminal activity, primarily due to the activities of drug cartels and related \ncriminal organizations, including in the State of Zacatecas. Any increase in the level of violence or a concentration of violence near or around the Peñasquito mine could have an adverse effect on operating results.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, we are dependent upon our employees being able to perform their jobs in a safe and respectful work environment.\nWe depend upon the services of a number of key executives and management personnel. Our success is also dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. Our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse personnel to execute on our strategy. There continues to be competition over highly skilled personnel in our industry. If we lose key personnel, or one or more members of our senior management team and/or executive leadership team and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse employees, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. Additionally, efforts to retain, attract and develop key personnel may also result in additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial performance and profitability.\nOur business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness or fatality. If we experience periods where our employees are unable to perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as COVID-19), our operations could be adversely affected. See the risk factor under the heading “Our operations and business have in the past been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be materially and adversely impacted in the future by pandemics, epidemics and other health emergencies.”\nIn addition to physical safety, protecting the psychological safety of our employees is necessary to maintaining a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment. We are fundamentally committed to creating and maintaining a work environment in which employees are treated fairly, with dignity, decency, respect and in accordance with all applicable laws. We recognize that bullying, sexual misconduct and sexual harassment, and harassment based on other protected categories, including race, have been prevalent in every industry, including the mining industry. Features of the mining industry, such as being a historically hierarchical and male-dominated culture, create risk factors for harmful workplace behavior. While we do not tolerate discrimination and harassment of any kind (including but not limited to gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, age, or disability, among others), our policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential harmful workplace behaviors. We occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in harmful behaviors and improper, inappropriate or unlawful conduct, including but not limited to bullying, discrimination and harassment. If the Company fails to maintain a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment, it could impact our ability to retain talent and maintain a diverse workforce and damage the Company’s reputation.\nIf the Company fails to maintain a safe environment that is free of harassment, discrimination or bullying, it could adversely impact employee engagement, performance and productivity, result in potential legal claims and/or damage the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or adversely affect the Company’s market value. See also the risk factor under the heading \"Damage to our reputation may result in decreased investor confidence, challenges in maintaining positive community relations and can pose additional obstacles to our ability to develop our projects, which may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.”\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects.\nA significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n•Negotiating agreements with contractors on acceptable terms;\n•New legislation limiting or altering the ability to utilize contractors or outsourced resources;\n•The inability to replace a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n•Reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n•Failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n•Interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n•Failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; \n•Problems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other employment issues; and\n•Liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors.\nA failure of contractors to align employment practices with Newmont standards can also result in reactions from our employees and our workforce as they express solidarity with their counterparts in the field.\nIn addition, laws and regulations relating to the use of contractors may vary in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and changes in legal and regulatory restrictions may also impact our ability to utilize contractors and outsourcing services. For example, new mining industry regulations came into effect in Ghana, Africa, which require that the supply of specific products and services, and certain roles, be reserved for citizens, which may limit the pool of available contractors and service providers and restrict our ability to utilize certain contractors. Additionally, the Mexican government enacted labor and tax laws in April 2021, significantly restricting certain subcontracting and outsourcing of personnel, which has required the conversion of certain contractors to employee status and resulted in increased labor costs. Further changes in law and the occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nLegal Risks\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other related anti-bribery laws and regulations. A breach or violation of these rules and regulations could lead to substantial sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of licenses or permits and other collateral consequences and reputational harm.\nWe operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws and heightened expectations of enforcement authorities may be in tension with certain local customs and practices. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws with extraterritorial reach, including the U.K. Bribery Act, and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other improper commercial advantage. We have a business integrity and compliance program which includes our Code of Conduct, Business Integrity Policy and other policies, standards, and procedures, all of which mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws by the Company and its affiliates and their personnel, and also by third parties when they are engaged on our behalf. Our program also includes preventative and detective controls, and a well-publicized business integrity helpline for raising complaints (including the option for anonymity if the reporter so chooses), questions and concerns as well as processes for evaluating and investigating such concerns and assurances of non-retaliation for persons who raise concerns in good faith. We report regularly to the executive leadership team and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors on such program components.\nWe could be held responsible if our internal controls, policies, and procedures fail to protect us from misinterpretation of, or noncompliance with, applicable anti-bribery laws, regulations and internal policies, recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, agents, or associated persons for which we might be considered responsible. As such, our corporate internal controls policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. In addition, and despite the fact that Newmont undertook significant pre and post-acquisition due diligence efforts, the compliance mechanisms and monitoring programs adopted and implemented by Newcrest prior to our acquisition of Newcrest in November 2023 may not have adequately prevented or detected all possible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and/or other applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations attributable to Newcrest prior to Newmont's acquisition and we may be held liable for any such violations. \nWe occasionally identify or are apprised of information or allegations that certain employees, affiliates, agents or associated persons may have engaged in improper or unlawful conduct for which we might be held responsible. Our policy when receiving credible information or allegations is to conduct investigations and compliance reviews to evaluate that information, determine compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and regulations and company policies and take such remedial steps as may be warranted, including the possibility of making a voluntary self-disclosure to the applicable authorities. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to substantial investigation and remedial costs, sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution, as well as fines and penalties, litigation, loss of operating licenses or permits and other collateral consequences, and may damage the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common shares to decline.\nOur business is subject to U.S. export control laws, economic sanctions, and other international trade compliance regulations with extraterritorial reach. A breach or violation of these laws could lead to substantial sanctions, civil and criminal prosecution, fines, penalties, litigation, loss of licenses or permits, and other collateral consequences, including reputational harm.\nExport control laws, economic sanctions and international trade compliance regulations are always changing. As such, we have established a trade compliance program that includes policies, standards, and procedures, designed to ensure compliance with these regulations. Our program includes preventive and detective controls, employee training, and a robust third-party screening and ongoing monitoring program. Despite these efforts, our internal controls, policies, and procedures may not detect or prevent all violations of trade compliance laws, and we could be held accountable for misconduct, errors, or failures by employees, affiliates, agents, or third-party partners. Additionally, in the context of our recent acquisition of Newcrest in November 2023, prior compliance mechanisms and monitoring efforts by Newcrest may not have adequately prevented or detected all violations of applicable trade compliance laws. We \nconduct investigations and evaluations in response to credible allegations of noncompliance, and may take remedial actions, including, where applicable, voluntary disclosures to authorities. Violations or allegations of trade compliance breaches could result in significant investigation costs, sanctions, litigation, loss of licenses, and reputational damage, which may materially impact our financial condition, operations, and the market value of our common shares.\nTitle to some of our properties may be insufficient, defective, or challenged.\nThe sufficiency or validity of the Company's Legal Title in and to its properties may be uncertain or subject to challenges by third parties, including governmental authorities, Indigenous or communal groups, or private entities. For example, at our Conga project in Peru, we continue to seek resolution to a land dispute with local residents. In Mexico, exploration and mining rights are granted through a mining concession, pertaining to the mineral estate, and do not confer rights of ownership, possession, use, or access in or to the corresponding surface estate. Surface rights must be acquired through purchase, lease, or easement from private parties, local communities, or governmental authorities. We enter into temporary occupation agreements ranging from five to thirty years with the Ejido communities, which allow us to use the surface of the lands for our mining operations, and at any particular time we may be involved in negotiations to enter into new temporary occupation agreements or other surface access agreements or amend existing agreements. Failure to reach new, or renewal of existing, agreements or disputes regarding these agreements may lead to, blockades, suspension of operations, project delays, and on occasion, may lead to legal disputes. \nIn addition, certain Australian and Canadian properties are owned by Indigenous peoples or are subject to certain inherent aboriginal rights, treaty rights, and/or asserted rights in and to their traditional territories, and our ability to acquire necessary rights to explore, develop, or mine these properties is dependent on agreements with them. Our ability to secure permits, licenses and/or agreements may be dependent on formal determinations of Indigenous or Native title rights issued by governmental authorities, the lack or delay of which may impede the Company’s ability to explore, develop, or mine. In Ghana, Peru, and Suriname, our Legal Title may be subject to challenge based on the presence and activities of artisanal miners or other trespassers due to adverse possession and/or the inability of the Company to satisfy its statutory, regulatory, or contractual obligations required to maintain, extend, or renew Legal Title in and to its land tenure. See risk factors under the headings “We may be unable to obtain or retain necessary permits and land or mining tenure, which could adversely affect our operations”, “Illegal mining and artisanal mining occurs on or adjacent to certain of our properties exposing such sites to security risks”, and “Civil disturbances and criminal activities can disrupt business and expose the Company to liability” above for further information. A determination of insufficient or defective Legal Title, or an adverse outcome from a challenge to our Legal Title, could result in loss, litigation, insurance claims, reputational damage, and the impairment, suspension, or cessation of exploration, development, or mining activities. Such outcomes could materially impact our operations, and result in significant financial losses that affect the Company's business as a whole. \nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to sell the common stock at the price you paid or at prices you find attractive.\nAs a publicly traded company with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\"), the Australian Securities Exchange (\"ASX\"), and the Papua New Guinea Stock Exchange (\"PNGX\") the market price and volume of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding the performance of our operations, business prospects or liquidity. Among the factors that could affect the price of our common stock are: (i) changes in gold, and to a lesser extent, silver, copper, zinc or lead prices; (ii) operating and financial performance that vary from the guidance we provided to securities analysts and investors or the expectations of securities analysts and investors or changes in our outlook; (iii) developments in our business or in the mining sector generally; (iv) regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations; (v) the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us; (vi) announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions, dispositions and other material events by us or our competitors; (vii) our ability to integrate and operate the companies and the businesses that we acquire; (viii) the perception of the Company’s ESG performance and its ability to deliver on ESG commitments and expectations, including in connection with the Company's climate strategy; (ix) response to activism; and (x) changes in global financial markets and macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, an escalation of sanctions, tariffs, or other trade tensions, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company, and has in the past been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and global conflicts, and could in the future be impacted by geopolitical and other macroeconomic factors. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, securities class action litigation is often brought against companies after periods of volatility in the market price of their securities, such as the securities class action filed in January 2025 asserting that statements we made in conjunction with our financial outlook from February 2024 to October 2024 were false or misleading, or failed to include material information (see Note 25 - Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding this class action law suit). We may in the future be the target of similar litigation which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.\nNewmont CHESS depositary interest (\"CDIs\") are quoted and trade on the ASX in Australian dollars, whereas Newmont common stock is quoted and trade on NYSE in US dollars. While Newmont CDI holders cannot directly trade the underlying Newmont \nstock on the NYSE, they are entitled to transmute their Newmont CDIs into common stock. There is a risk that the liquidity in the market for Newmont CDIs reduces for a range of reasons including a reduction in the number of CDIs on issue due to the conversion of CDIs to Newmont common stock. Reduced liquidity in the market can impact the speed at which CDIs are able to be bought or sold and the price at which they trade. For a range of reasons, including liquidity, market sentiment and the AUD:USD exchange rate, there is potential CDIs may trade at a discount to our common stock trading on NYSE. \nNewmont PETS depository interests (“PDIs”) on PNGX have similar risks to Newmont CDIs as set out above. In addition, as PNG is a developing country, PNGX is a stock exchange located in an emerging market set within a dynamic political landscape. As a result of this, the PNGX and its listing rules may be liable to review and overhaul. This recently occurred with the introduction of a new suite of PNGX Listing Rules which came into effect on July 3, 2023. As the PNGX currently has only 11 companies listed, these new PNGX Listing Rules are largely yet to be tested in practice and, as the PNGX has complete discretion over any application for listing, a risk of uncertainty arises as to their application, particularly in respect of PDIs, as changes to the PNGX Business Rules addressing PDI’s were not included in the recent suite of amendments.\nIn addition, it is possible that further changes to the PNGX Listing Rules or the PNGX Business Rules will be made in the future, either in respect of PDIs or more generally. Uncertainty created as a result of changing or untested PNGX Listing Rules or PNGX Business Rules may give rise to delays in actions sought to be taken by Newmont, by Newmont PDI holders, and any new compliance requirements may impact on the desirability of Newmont PDIs as a security.\nThe PNGX is a small market resulting in limited liquidity. Newmont does not know the extent to which investor interest will lead to the development of an active trading market for the Newmont PDIs or how liquid that market may become. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for the Newmont PDIs will develop or that the price of the Newmont PDIs will increase. There may be relatively few potential buyers or sellers of the Newmont PDIs on the PNGX at any time. This may increase the volatility of the market price of the Newmont PDIs. It may also affect the prevailing market price at which stockholders are able to sell their Newmont PDIs. This may result in stockholders receiving a market price for their Newmont PDIs that is less than the price that the stockholder paid.\nHolders of our common stock, CDIs and PDIs may not receive dividends.\nHolders of our common stock (including those who hold Newmont CDIs and Newmont PDIs) are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be determined based on Newmont’s financial results, balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity requirements, future prospects, gold and commodity prices and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to declare cash dividends on our common stock (and, by extension, Newmont CDIs and PDIs). An annualized dividend payout level has not been declared by the Board of Directors, and the declaration and payment of future dividends, including future quarterly dividends, remains at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Our dividend framework is non-binding, and our Board of Directors may modify the dividend framework or reduce, defer or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. A reduction or suspension in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nCompliance with exchange listing rules as a foreign exempt listing may differ from investor expectations.\nNewmont is subject to the listing standards of the NYSE, as its primary stock exchange. In addition, it is subject to additional requirements and standards of its secondary listings on the ASX, TSX and PNGX. For example, as part of Newmont’s acquisition of Newcrest, Newmont was admitted to the Official List of ASX Limited as a foreign exempt listing. As a foreign exempt listing, Newmont is exempt from complying with substantially all of the ASX Listing Rules on the basis that Newmont must comply with the rules of its home exchange, the NYSE. ASX Listing Rules with regard to Foreign Exempt Listings which apply to Newmont include: (i) providing the ASX with copies of its public filings; (ii) continuing to comply with the NYSE Listing Rules; (iii) registering as a foreign company carrying on business in Australia under the Corporations Act; and (iv) complying with certain ASX Listing Rules concerning procedural and administrative matters, including lodging announcements, trading halt, suspension and removal. While a benefit of holding CDIs for Australian investors is that it enables trading of Newmont stock on the ASX (via a Newmont CDI), individual investors need to weigh this convenience with the risks inherent in trading CDIs on the ASX rather than the underlying stock on the NYSE, including the potential for delays in disclosure being released to the ASX and fluctuations in price due to trading in underlying Newmont common stock on the NYSE that occurs outside of the ASX trading hours (and which may be influenced by disclosures made outside of ASX trading hours). There may also be a commercial or other disadvantage to investors from the differing disclosure regimes and expectations, as between a stock with a primary listing on the ASX compared to a CDI that is underpinned by a stock with a primary listing on the NYSE. Accordingly, investors in Australia, Canada and PNG should be aware that under applicable listing rules, Newmont’s disclosure obligations as a foreign exempt listing will differ from those of companies with a primary or non-exempt listing on ASX, TSX or PNGX, including without limitation, in connection with certain filing and distribution requirements, financial presentation requirements, and reserve and resource declaration requirements.\nRisks Related to Assets Held for Sale and Divestitures\nAssets held for sale may not ultimately be divested and we may not receive any or all deferred consideration.\nExpectations regarding the planned divestment of assets held for sale are subject to risks and uncertainties. Based on a comprehensive review of the Company’s portfolio of assets, the Company announced a portfolio optimization program to divest six non-core assets and a development project in February 2024. While the Company concluded that these non-core assets and the development project met the accounting requirements to be presented as assets held for sale, there is a possibility that these assets may not be sold for more than one year from the date management committed to sell them, or that they may not be sold at all, due to events or circumstances beyond the Company's control. No assurances can be provided with respect to the satisfaction of closing conditions, including but not limited to entering into transition service agreements, the timing of closing of the transactions or receipt of contingent consideration in the future. While the Telfer/Havieron sale has closed, the terms of the agreement included deferred contingent cash consideration of up to $100. No assurance can be provided with respect to our receipt of such deferred consideration which may be payable to Newmont in cash through a gold price linked payment structure with a 50% price upside participation by Newmont in respect of gold produced from Havieron for five calendar years following the declaration of commercial production, subject to a hurdle gold price of $1,850/oz. The closing of the Akyem sale transaction remains pending as of the date of this report and is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions precedent, including but not limited to, the purchaser obtaining certain filings, approvals, or registrations. Similarly, receipt of $900 in cash consideration for the Akyem sale transaction is subject to closing of the transaction, and an additional $100 in cash consideration may be paid after the earliest to occur of the ratification of the currently renewed Akyem East and West mining leases by the Parliament of Ghana, or the five-year anniversary of the closing date. Additionally, the Akyem sale includes an indemnification in which the Company will indemnify the buyer for losses up to $200 resulting from (i) non-ratification of the Akyem East and West mining leases by the Parliament of Ghana, for a five-year claim period; or (ii) government actions stopping operations within eight months of the transaction close. The purchase price payable at the closing is subject to adjustments for closing cash, working capital, inventory, finished goods inventory, and other customary purchase price adjustment items. The closing of the Musselwhite sale remains subject to no material adverse changes and completion of the pre-closing reorganization and key regulatory approvals, including the Canadian Competition Act. Similarly, receipt of $810 in cash consideration for the Musselwhite sale transaction is subject to closing of the transaction, and an additional $40 in cash consideration may be paid in two installments of $20 at the one- and two-year anniversary of the closing date, subject to certain hurdle gold price of $2,900/oz and $3,000/oz, respectively. The purchase price payable at the closing is subject to adjustments for working capital, finished goods inventory, and other customary purchase price adjustment items. The closing of the Éléonore sale remains subject to no material adverse change and no transaction-related litigation, the completion of the pre-closing reorganization, and regulatory approvals, including the Canadian Competition Act. Similarly, receipt of $795 in cash consideration for the Éléonore sale transaction is subject to closing of the transaction subject to adjustments for working capital, finished goods inventory, and other customary purchase price adjustment items. The closing of the CC&V sale remains subject to no material adverse change and no transaction-related litigation, the completion of the pre-closing reorganization, and regulatory approvals, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act review in the United States. Similarly, receipt of $100 in cash consideration for the CC&V sale transaction is subject to closing of the transaction, and an additional $175 in cash consideration may be paid in two equal installments upon certain regulatory approvals and finalization of remediation plans. Additionally, the CC&V sale includes an indemnification in which the Company will indemnify the buyer for 90% of closure costs over $500 with an opportunity to eliminate via a one-time payment. The purchase price payable at the closing is subject to adjustments for working capital, finished goods inventory, and other customary purchase price adjustment items. No assurances can be provided with respect to the timing of closing for these pending sales, receipt of contingent consideration payments in the future, or adjustments due to indemnification requirements or liabilities. \nThe Company’s asset divestitures place demands on the Company’s management and resources, the sale of divested assets may not occur as planned or at all, and the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures.\nThe divestiture process involves numerous risks, including significant costs and expenses such as transaction-related fees and potential tax liabilities. If we are unable to complete divestitures on favorable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The anticipated benefits of these divestitures, such as cost savings, and productivity improvements, depend on the efficient and effective transition of operations from Newmont to the asset purchasers. In addition, certain closing conditions rely on performance by the purchaser or third parties including government agencies. No assurances can be provided that the necessary government approvals will be obtained on acceptable terms, or at all, or that the other closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all.\nDivestitures require the transition of systems and personnel, which may involve anticipated and unanticipated liabilities, costs, and the loss of key employees. Additionally, the transition process could disrupt existing relationships with suppliers, employees, customers, and other stakeholders. Demands will be placed on our managerial, operational, and financial personnel and systems to close these transactions, transition the assets, and provide transition services which may potentially extend for up to a year post closing. In the period between signing and closing, we are required to maintain an as-is state until transition. The resources required by the Company to effect and support the transition depend on the requirements of the purchaser. For example, we may be required to enter into transitional support agreements with the purchasers of these assets, which may require that we provide services and support in areas such as IT, procurement, human resources and finance. The transition process will likely involve, amongst other items, \ntransitioning contracts, licenses, software, and other physical assets, and assisting the purchasers in setting up system to be in a position to run the assets.\nThere can be no assurance that our systems, procedures, and controls will be adequate to support the transitional services and associated complexities. Challenges or delays in the successful transition of services could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Certain closing conditions may require that the Company be liable for limited specific performance post-closing of the divested business or otherwise be exposed to greater-than-anticipated liabilities, including liabilities if a purchaser fails to honor its commitments. These factors may impact the value attributable to or derived from the divested business.",
