      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nHistory and Organization\nHuntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (\"HII\", the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") is a global, all-domain defense partner, building and delivering the world's most powerful, survivable naval ships and technologies that safeguard America’s seas, sky, land, space, and cyber. For more than a century, our Ingalls Shipbuilding segment (\"Ingalls\") in Mississippi and Newport News Shipbuilding segment (\"Newport News\") in Virginia have built more ships in more ship classes than any other U.S. naval shipbuilder, making us America's largest shipbuilder. Our Mission Technologies segment develops integrated technology solutions and products that enable today's connected, all domain force. Headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, we employ over 44,000 people domestically and internationally.\nWe conduct most of our business with the U.S. Government, primarily the Department of Defense (\"DoD\"). As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or partner, we participate in many high-priority U.S. defense programs. Ingalls includes our non-nuclear ship design, construction, repair, and maintenance businesses. Newport News includes all of our nuclear ship design, construction, overhaul, refueling, and repair and maintenance businesses. Our Mission Technologies segment provides a wide range of services and products, including command, control, computers, communications, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and operations; the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to battlefield decisions; defense and offensive cyberspace strategies and electronic warfare; uncrewed autonomous systems; live, virtual, and constructive training solutions; fleet sustainment; and critical nuclear operations.\nIngalls\n\nThrough our Ingalls segment, we design and construct non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, including amphibious assault ships, expeditionary warfare ships, surface combatants, and national security cutters (\"NSC\"). We are the sole builder of amphibious assault ships and one of two builders of surface combatants for the U.S. Navy. We are the sole builder of large multi-mission NSCs for the U.S. Coast Guard. Our Ingalls segment is located in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 800 acres along the Pascagoula River.\nAmphibious Assault Ships\n\nWe construct amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S. Navy, which include U.S. Navy large deck amphibious assault ships (\"LHA\") and amphibious transport dock ships (\"LPD\"), respectively. The LHA is a key component of the Department of the Navy's requirement for Expeditionary Strike Groups/Amphibious Readiness Groups, and design, construction, and modernization of LHAs are core to our Ingalls operations. In 2007, we were awarded the construction contract for USS America (LHA 6), the first in a class of enhanced amphibious assault ships designed from the keel up to be an aviation optimized Marine assault platform. We are currently constructing Bougainville (LHA 8) and Fallujah (LHA 9). In 2023, we were awarded a long-lead-time material contract for Helmand Province (LHA 10), and in 2024, we were awarded a contract modification for the detail design and construction of Helmand Province (LHA 10).\n\nThe LPD program is a long-running production program of expeditionary warfare ships. We delivered USS Fort Lauderdale (LPD 28) in 2022 and Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29) in 2024. We are currently constructing Harrisburg (LPD 30), and Pittsburgh (LPD 31). In 2023, we were awarded a contract to construct Philadelphia (LPD 32). In 2024, we were awarded a multi-ship procurement contract for the construction of Travis Manion (LPD 33), LPD 34 (unnamed), and LPD 35 (unnamed).\nSurface Combatants\n\nWe are a design agent for, and one of only two companies that constructs, Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyers (\"DDG\"), a class of surface combatant. We have delivered 35 Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers to the U.S. Navy, including USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125) in 2023, USS Lenah H. Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG 123) in 2022, and USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. (DDG 121) in 2021. In 2018, we were awarded a multi-year contract for construction of six Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers and, in 2020,a contract to construct an additional \n\n\n\nArleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyer. In 2023, we were awarded a multi-year contract for construction of six more Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers, as well as the first option ship, for a total of seven ships. We are currently constructing Ted Stevens (DDG 128), Jeremiah Denton (DDG 129), George M. Neal (DDG 131), Sam Nunn (DDG 133), and Thad Cochran (DDG 135). \n\nNational Security Cutters\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard's recapitalization program is replacing aging and operationally expansive ships and aircraft used to conduct missions in excess of 50 miles from the shoreline. The flagship of this program is the Legend class NSC, a multi-mission platform we designed and continue to build. In 2018, we were awarded long-lead-time material and construction contracts for Calhoun (NSC 10), which was delivered to the U.S. Coast Guard in 2023.\nNewport News\nThe core business of our Newport News segment is designing and constructing nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines, and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Our Newport News shipyard is located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the James River, which adjoins the Chesapeake Bay.\nDesign, Construction, Refueling and Complex Overhaul, and Inactivation of Aircraft Carriers\nEngineering, design, and construction of U.S. Navy nuclear aircraft carriers (\"CVN\") are core to Newport News operations. Aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the U.S. Navy's fleet, with a displacement of over 90,000 tons. Newport News has designed and built more than 31 aircraft carriers for the U.S. Navy since 1933, including all ten Nimitz class (CVN 68) aircraft carriers currently in active service, as well as the first ship of the next generation Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers.\n\nWe delivered USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), the first aircraft carrier of the Gerald R. Ford class to the U.S. Navy in 2017. Beginning in 2009, we received contract awards totaling $8.8 billion for construction preparation, detail design, and construction of the second Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carrier, John F. Kennedy (CVN 79). In addition, we have received contract awards valued at $15.3 billion for detail design and construction of the Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers, Enterprise (CVN 80) and Doris Miller (CVN 81).\n\nWe continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul (\"RCOH\"). Each RCOH takes nearly four years to complete, with the work accounting for approximately 35% of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carrier's 50 year service life. RCOH services include propulsion work (refueling of reactors; propulsion plant modernization; and propulsion plant repairs), restoration of service life (dry docking, tank, and void maintenance; hull, shafting, propellers, and rudders; launch and recovery system; piping repairs; and component refurbishment), and modernization (electrical systems; aviation support systems; warfare; interoperability; and environmental compliance). We provide ongoing maintenance services for the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier fleet through both RCOH and fleet support services worldwide. \nUSS George Washington (CVN 73) was redelivered to the U.S. Navy in 2023 after completion of its RCOH, and we are currently performing the RCOH of USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). We believe our current position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our RCOH performance on the first seven Nimitz class (CVN 68) carriers, our highly trained workforce, the capital-intensive nature of RCOH work, and high barriers to entry due to required nuclear expertise position us well for RCOH contract awards on the remaining Nimitz class (CVN 68) carriers, as well as future RCOH work on Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers.\nAircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years, and we believe the ten Nimitz class (CVN 68) carriers we delivered that are currently in active service, as well as Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers, present significant opportunities for inactivation contracts as they reach the end of their lifespans. We believe we are well positioned to be the U.S. Navy's shipyard of choice for these contract awards.\nDesign and Construction of Nuclear-Powered Submarines\n\nWe are one of only two companies in the United States currently capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. Newport News has delivered 64 submarines to the U.S. Navy since 1960, comprised \n\n\n\nof 50 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Our nuclear submarine program, located at our Newport News shipyard, includes construction, engineering, design, research, and integrated planning. \nVirginia Class (SSN 774) Submarines\nWe have a teaming agreement with Electric Boat Corporation (\"Electric Boat\"), a division of General Dynamics Corporation (\"General Dynamics\"), to build Virginia class (SSN 774) fast attack nuclear submarines. Under the teaming arrangement, we build the stern, habitability and machinery spaces, torpedo room, sail, and bow, while Electric Boat builds the engine room, control room, and pressure hull structure. Work on the reactor plant and the final assembly, test, outfit, and delivery of the submarines to the U.S. Navy alternates between Electric Boat and us. \nThe four submarines of the first block, six submarines of the second block, and eight submarines of the third block of Virginia class (SSN 774) submarines have been delivered. In 2014, the team was awarded a construction contract for the fourth block of ten Virginia class (SSN 774) submarines, which contemplated production of two submarines per year. The first submarine of the Block IV contract was delivered in 2020, and five more submarines have been delivered through 2024. The remaining four boats of the Block IV contract are in the final assembly and test phases of construction. \nIn 2019, the team was awarded a construction contract for the fifth block of nine Virginia class (SSN 774) submarines, and, in 2021, an option for a 10th submarine was exercised, continuing the two submarines per year production rate. Ten of the Block V boats are in manufacturing and outfitting stages of construction.\nIn 2023, the team was awarded a contract modification for advance procurement for long lead-time material in support of two additional Block V boats, bringing the total Block V boats to 12. In 2023 and 2024, the team received contract awards for advance procurement of long-lead-time material in support of all ten Block VI boats.\nColumbia Class (SSBN 826) Submarines\nNewport News is participating in the design and construction of the Columbia class (SSBN 826) nuclear ballistic missile submarines (\"SSBN\") as a replacement for the current aging Ohio class submarines, which were first introduced into service in 1981. The Columbia class (SSBN 826) program currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines. We perform design work as a subcontractor to Electric Boat, and we have entered into a teaming agreement with Electric Boat to build modules for the entire Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarine program that leverages our Virginia class (SSN 774) experience. Contract award for the first two Columbia class submarines (SSBN 826 and SSBN 827) and construction start of the first Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarine occurred in late 2020. In 2023, we were awarded a contract modification for long-lead-time material and advance construction in support of five additional Columbia class (SSBN 826) boats, also referred to as Build II of the class.\nNaval Nuclear Support Services\nNewport News provides additional services to and in support of the U.S. Navy, ranging from services supporting the Navy's carrier and submarine fleets to maintenance services at U.S. Navy training facilities. Fleet support services include design, construction, maintenance, and disposal activities for in-service U.S. Navy nuclear ships worldwide through mobile and in-house capabilities. We also provide maintenance services on nuclear reactor prototypes, such as those at the Kenneth A. Kesselring Site, a research and development facility in New York that supports the U.S. Navy, which were completed in 2024.\nMission Technologies \nOur Mission Technologies segment is organized into four groups, All-Domain Operations, Warfare Systems, Global Security, and Uncrewed Systems, and specializes in a wide range of services and products across our capabilities. Capabilities including command, control, computers, communications, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and operations; the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to battlefield decisions; defense and offensive cyberspace strategies and electronic warfare; uncrewed autonomous systems; live, virtual, and constructive training solutions; fleet sustainment; and critical nuclear operations.\n\n\n\nCommand, control, computers, communications, cyber, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (\"C5ISR\")\nDesigns, develops, integrates, and manages the sensors, systems, and other assets necessary to support integrated C5ISR operations and accelerated decision-making. These business activities provide data fusion and mission management capabilities for the DoD, the combatant commands, and the intelligence community. \nCyber and electronic warfare (\"CEW&S\")\nWorks within our nation’s intelligence and cyber operations communities to defend U.S. interests in cyberspace and anticipate emerging threats. Our capabilities in cybersecurity, network architecture, reverse engineering, software, and hardware development uniquely enable our ability to support sensitive missions for the U.S. military and federal agency partners. We also develop, test, and integrate leading-edge AI and machine learning algorithms to optimize and accelerate the nation’s mission-critical systems and platforms. \nLive, virtual, and constructive solutions (\"LVC\")\nA trusted partner to our military customers, our capabilities include designing, developing, and operating the largest live, virtual, and constructive enterprise that prepares warfighters for cross-domain battle. Our training connects live environments with virtual platforms and simulated (constructive) threats to prepare trainees through integrated, real-world scenarios before they are in harm’s way. This is a modern and distributed approach to U.S. military training.\nFleet Sustainment\nProvides comprehensive life-cycle sustainment to the U.S. Navy fleet and other DoD and commercial maritime customers. Services include maintenance, modernization, and repair on all ship classes; naval architecture, marine engineering, and design; integrated logistics support; technical documentation development; warehousing, asset management, and material readiness; operational and maintenance training development and delivery; software design and development; IT infrastructure support and data delivery and management; and cyber security and information assurance. We also provide undersea vehicle and specialized craft development and prototyping services.\nUncrewed systems\nDevelops advanced uncrewed systems for defense, marine research, and commercial applications. Serving customers in more than 30 countries, we provide design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations, and sustainment of uncrewed systems, including uncrewed underwater vehicles and uncrewed surface vessels.\nNuclear and Environmental Services\nNuclear and Environmental Services support the Department of Energy’s (\"DoE\") national security mission through the management and operation of DoE sites, as well as the safe cleanup of legacy waste across the country. Through participation in joint ventures, including Newport News Nuclear BWXT Los Alamos, LLC (\"N3B\"), Mission Support and Test Services, LLC (\"MSTS\"), and Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC (\"SRNS\"), we meet customers’ toughest nuclear and environmental challenges. \nCustomers\nOur revenues are primarily derived from the U.S. Government, including the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, the DoD, the DoE, and other federal agencies. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, approximately 80%, 81%, and 82%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from the U.S. Navy.\nIntellectual Property\nWe develop new technologies that are incorporated into the products and services we provide to our customers. We also develop new manufacturing processes and systems-integration technologies and processes that we use to produce our products and to provide services to our customers. In addition to owning intellectual property, we license intellectual property rights to and from other parties. The U.S. Government generally receives non-exclusive \n\n\n\nlicenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of U.S. Government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our U.S. Government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense. The U.S. Government may use or authorize other parties to use the intellectual property we license to the government. While our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property.\nSeasonality\nNo material portion of our business is seasonal. The timing of our revenue recognition is based on multiple factors, including the timing of contract awards, the incurrence of contract costs, contract cost estimation, and unit deliveries. See Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8.\nBacklog\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our total backlog was approximately $48.7 billion and $48.1 billion, respectively. We expect approximately 21% of backlog at December 31, 2024, to be converted into sales in 2025. \nRaw Materials\n\nWe rely on third parties to provide raw materials. The most significant material we use is steel. Other materials we use in large quantities include paint, aluminum, pipe, electrical cables, electronic components, fittings, custom machine items, and sensors. In connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. For long-term contracts, we generally solicit price quotations for many of our material requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing. While we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source, we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts as a result of consolidation in the defense industry. We have experienced challenges with access to, and the pricing of, certain raw materials, components, and other supplies due to, in part, labor shortages and inflation. The inability to procure the necessary raw materials, components, and other supplies for our products on a timely and cost-effective basis has negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. We endeavor to mitigate supply chain risk through various measures, such as negotiating long-term agreements with certain raw material suppliers and through price escalation provisions in certain customer contracts. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials.\nRegulatory Matters\nWe operate in heavily regulated markets and must comply with a variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts, as well as legal and regulatory requirements relating to, among others, cybersecurity, environmental protection, and our nuclear operations. These requirements increase our contract performance costs and compliance costs and risks. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further discussion regarding risks related to regulatory matters.\nGovernment Contracting\nWe are overseen and audited by the U.S. Government and its agencies, including the U.S. Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\"), and the Defense Contract Management Agency (\"DCMA\"). These agencies evaluate our contract performance, cost structures, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings, which could result in fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory, treble, or other damages. Certain U.S. Government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export privileges.\nU.S. Government agencies also evaluate the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to U.S. Government requirements. Our business systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems, purchasing systems, government property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management accounting systems. The U.S. Government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, with little or no prior notice, for convenience or for default based upon performance. In the event of termination of a contract for convenience, a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on incurred costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. Such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program. A termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities, including excess re-procurement costs, and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts. \nOur contracts with the U.S. Government sometimes result in Requests for Equitable Adjustments (\"REAs\"), which represent requests for the U.S. Government to make appropriate adjustments to contract terms, including pricing, delivery schedule, technical requirements, or other affected terms, due to changes to the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption for which the U.S. Government is responsible. We submit and negotiate REAs in the ordinary course of business, and large REAs are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and RCOH activities. REAs can result in claims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 in cases in which we cannot reach agreement with the U.S. Government.\n\nU.S. Government regulations determine contractor costs that are allowable and therefore recoverable from the government, and certain costs are not allowable and therefore not recoverable. The U.S. Government also regulates the methods by which allowable costs, including overhead, are allocated to government contracts. Costs we incur that are not allowable under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (the “FAR”) or U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (“CAS”) or that are otherwise determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract are not recoverable or must be refunded if already reimbursed.\n\nOur business, including contracts with U.S. Government agencies and subcontracts with other prime contractors, is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including the FAR, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (\"DFARS\"), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act, CAS, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in contract values, contract modifications or terminations, penalties, fines, repayments, compensatory, treble, or other damages, or suspension or debarment. We are also subject to evolving cyber security and data privacy and protection laws and regulations, which increase our costs and compliance risks and may affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to damage claims, substantial fines, and other penalties. See Note 6: Revenue under Item 8 and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further information regarding our contracts.\nNuclear\nOur nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, the DoE, and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the event of noncompliance, these agencies may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, or shut down our operations, depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance. In addition, new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, the DoE, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures.\nSubject to certain requirements and limitations, our contracts with the U.S. Navy and the DoE generally provide for indemnity by the U.S. Government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations. For our commercial nuclear operations, we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation, and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further information regarding nuclear regulatory matters.\nEnvironmental\nOur operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Substantial fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance, and certain environmental laws impose joint and several \"strict liability\" for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties.\n\n\n\nWe accrue estimated costs to perform environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future, in amounts we can reasonably estimate, to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities, or at sites where we are named a Potentially Responsible Party (\"PRP\") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") or similarly designated by another environmental agency. Uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation, determination of legally responsible parties, and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations make future environmental remediation costs difficult to estimate and can cause our estimated remediation costs to change.\nWe believe we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business. We could be affected by new or evolving environmental laws, regulations, or policies. We have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental legal requirements, but we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations. We do not currently believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A and Note 15: Commitments and Contingencies under Item 8 for further information regarding environmental matters.\nCompetitive Environment\nIn our business of designing, building, overhauling, and repairing military ships, we primarily compete with General Dynamics and, in the case of certain non-nuclear shipbuilding programs, smaller shipyards. The smaller shipyards sometimes team with large defense contractors. Intense competition related to programs, resources, funding, and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our shipbuilding business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general. It is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another party, become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party. It is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and simultaneously serve as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding long-term contracts, enables companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries.\nWe believe we are well-positioned in our shipbuilding markets. Because we are the only company currently capable of building, refueling, and inactivating the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, we believe we are positioned well to be awarded future contracts to perform such activities. Even so, the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities. If a U.S. Government shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our market position would likely be significantly and adversely affected.\nWhile we have competed with another large defense contractor to build large deck amphibious ships, we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S. Navy, including LHAs and LPDs. We are also the sole builder of NSCs for the U.S. Coast Guard. We are one of only two companies currently capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy, and we are party to long-term teaming agreements with the other company for the production of both Virginia class (SSN 774) fast attack nuclear submarines and Columbia class (SSBN 826) ballistic missile submarines. We are one of only two companies that builds the U.S. Navy's current fleet of Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers and are positioned well to be awarded future contracts for surface combatant ships. \nOur Mission Technologies segment competes domestically and internationally against large aerospace and defense (\"A&D\") companies, primarily L3 Harris, Amentum, ManTech, Leidos, and, increasingly, small businesses serving the intelligence community. To a lesser extent, our lines of business compete on certain contracts with major prime A&D contractors, including Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, RTX Corporation, and Boeing.\nKey competitive factors in the Mission Technologies segment include technology capabilities; innovative cyber advances and artificial intelligence; the ability to develop and implement complex, integrated solutions; the ability to meet delivery schedules; and cost effectiveness. Our success depends on investments in our people, technologies, and products to meet the evolving needs of our customers. To remain competitive, we must be able to identify emerging technology trends and consistently provide superior service, while understanding customer priorities and maintaining customer relationships.\n\n\n\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop, market, produce, and deliver our products and services at costs and on schedules consistent with our customers' expectations, as well as our ability to provide the workforce, technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe recognize that our employees are our most important resources and serve as the foundation for our ability to achieve financial and strategic objectives. Our employees are critical to driving operational execution, meeting customer expectations, delivering strong financial performance, advancing innovation, and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program. Our leaders believe each employee contributes to our success.\n\nWe have over 44,000 employees. We are the largest industrial employer in Virginia and the largest private employer in Mississippi. We employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades, with approximately 7,000 engineers and designers and approximately 4,600 employees with advanced degrees. Our workforce contains many third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation employees, and approximately 1,525 employees with more than 40 years of continuous service. Employees in our shipbuilding segments with more than 40 years of continuous service achieve the honor of “Master Shipbuilder.” As of December 31, 2024, we had 1,260 Master Shipbuilders at Newport News and 213 at Ingalls. We also employ more than 6,500 veterans across the enterprise.\nIn addition, over 1,400 apprentices are enrolled in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs at our two shipbuilding segments. From nuclear pipe welders to senior executives, we employ approximately 4,100 apprentice school alumni at Newport News and Ingalls.\nApproximately 45% of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements. Newport News has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, which expire in February 2027, December 2027 and April 2029. Ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, all of which expire in March 2026. Approximately 15 Mission Technologies employees in Klamath Falls, Oregon are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in June 2025. \nWe have not experienced a work stoppage in more than 25 years at Newport News and more than 17 years at Ingalls. We are committed to working effectively with our existing unions and believe our relationship with our represented employees is satisfactory. \nThe success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and develop a skilled workforce of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. To succeed in the markets in which we compete for labor, we have developed key workforce development, recruitment, and retention strategies and objectives that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies and objectives form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies, and initiatives:\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits - Our compensation programs are designed to ensure we have the ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees to achieve our objectives.\n•We provide employee base wages and salaries that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location.\n•We utilize nationally recognized surveys and outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our employee and executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry. \n•The structure of our executive compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance, and we align our executive long-term equity compensation metrics with long-term shareholder interests.\n•Employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, 401(k) plans, and life and disability/accident insurance coverage. We also offer a variety of benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including: annual leave/paid time off; paid holidays, flexible work arrangements/schedules; telemedicine; parental leave; and a wellness program that includes physical, mental, and financial wellness components. We also fund the operation of Family Health Centers near our two shipyards, which provide a full range of medical, lab, pharmacy, dental, physical therapy, and vision services.\n\n\n\nRecruitment, Training, and Workforce Development - We are focused on attracting, retaining, and developing a skilled workforce, and in 2024, we hired approximately 10,000 new employees. To help us meet the increasing demand for talent, we maintain multiple talent pipelines and continue to review and update our talent management strategies to meet operational needs. \nOne of the key components of our approach to workforce development is to “grow our own.” We operate two apprentice schools, one at Ingalls and one at Newport News. The Newport News Apprentice School was founded in 1919, and the Ingalls Apprentice School was founded in 1952. The two apprentice schools combined have graduated over 15,500 graduates since their inceptions. The schools are nationally renowned and are critical to training both our craft/trades and technical workforce, as well as developing the future leaders of our company. The Ingalls Apprentice School has partnered with the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College to permit their apprentices to earn credits toward an associate’s degree. The Newport News Apprentice School has partnered with two community colleges, as well as Old Dominion University, to enable apprentices to earn a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Modeling & Simulation. \nIn addition to operating our own apprentice schools, we maintain partnerships with colleges and universities, military bases for transitioning veterans, and regional community colleges to enable us to recruit and hire engineering, IT, and other technical talent. Working closely with state and local government leaders, we also have facilitated local, regional, and state-wide workforce development and education initiatives that include pre-K programs, high school trades programs/talent development labs, pre-hire trades/technical community college programs, interns/co-ops with colleges and universities, adult trades programs, veterans and military spouses training programs, and unemployed/underemployed training programs.\nWe view our workforce development process as critical to our success and have developed a robust and effective succession planning process that ensures continuity in our leadership ranks. Since our founding in 2011, we have followed our succession plans over 80% of the time when replacing a vacancy in an existing vice president position, and we have filled approximately 80% of newly created vice president positions with internal hires. See \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A for further information regarding our human capital resources.\nEnvironmental, Health & Safety (“EH&S”) - The health, safety, and well-being of our employees, together with protection of the environment in the communities in which we operate, is one of our core values and rooted in our culture across the enterprise. We prioritize, manage, and carefully track safety performance and integrate sound environmental, safety, and health practices to make a meaningful difference in every facet of our operations, particularly at our shipbuilding segments and at DoE sites on which Mission Technologies segment employees work. \n\nSafety goals are included in operational metrics under the Newport News and Ingalls compensation programs. We also use a wide variety of training courses, pre-job “Take Five” crew talks, medical surveillance programs, and employee involvement to focus our workforce on EH&S. At Newport News and Ingalls, a key component of our EH&S program is the utilization of health and safety teams, which are comprised of production and maintenance employees and front-line managers whose goal is to educate, engage, and empower our workforce toward a culture that strives to reduce injury, illness, and environmental impacts. We employ programs focused on identifying, reporting, and abating near misses and other programs that aim to recognize, evaluate, and control hazards, and track multiple metrics related to occupational injuries as one of several methods to monitor our safety performance. \nAvailable Information\nWe maintain a website at the following address: hii.com.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. We encourage you to consider carefully the risk factors described below when evaluating the information contained in this report as the outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business is subject to a number of risks that, if realized, could materially affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. These risks are discussed more fully below, and include, but are not limited to, the following:\nIndustry and Economic Risk Factors\n•We depend on the U.S. Government for substantially all of our business, and risks associated with conducting business with the U.S. Government could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n•Significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and/or changes in customer priorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n•Changes in estimates used in contract accounting and contract cost growth have affected and could continue to affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\n•Changes to DoD business practices could have a material effect on DoD's procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards.\n•Competition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share.\n•Our level of indebtedness and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or our ability to incur additional debt.\n•We have classified contracts with the U.S. government, which limits investor insight into portions of our business.\nBusiness and Operational Risk Factors\n•Cost growth on flexibly priced contracts that does not result in higher contract prices due from customers reduces our profit and exposes us to the potential loss of future business.\n•We depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and challenges associated with our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel have harmed and may continue to negatively impact our business.\n•Our earnings and profitability depend, in part, upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing.\n•Our future success depends in part on our ability to increase our current and future shipbuilding capacity. If we are unable to do so, or to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n•Many of our contracts include performance obligations that incorporate innovative designs, state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise, or new technologies, or otherwise are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control, and failure to meet performance expectations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects.\n•Changes in key estimates and assumptions associated with postretirement benefit plans, such as discount rates and assumed long-term returns on assets, actual investment returns on our pension plan assets, and legislative and regulatory actions could significantly affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. \n•We could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber security threats, and related disruptions.\n•We utilize artificial intelligence, which could expose us to liability or adversely affect our business, especially if we are unable to compete effectively with others in adopting artificial intelligence.\n•Our business is subject to disruptions caused by natural disasters, environmental disasters, and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n•We face risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks.\n\n\n\n•Our business could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful negotiating new collective bargaining agreements.\n•Changes in future business conditions could cause business investments, recorded goodwill, and/or purchased intangible assets to become impaired, resulting in losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk Factors\n•As a U.S. Government contractor, we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or negative findings from a U.S. Government audit or investigation.\n•We are subject to investigations, claims, litigation, disputes and other legal proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us.\n•Environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n•Our nuclear operations subject us to environmental, regulatory, financial, and other risks.\n•Our reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents, suppliers, subcontractors or business partners.\n•Changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\n•We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to compete.\n•Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law, as well as regulatory requirements, could delay or prevent a change in control.\n•Our Restated Bylaws include an exclusive forum requirement for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for such disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n•Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position.\n•Market volatility and adverse capital market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors.\n•If we fail to manage acquisitions, joint ventures, equity investments, and other transactions successfully or if acquired businesses or equity investments fail to perform as expected, our financial results, business, and future prospects could be harmed.\n•We can provide no assurance we will continue to increase our dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nIndustry and Economic Risk Factors\nWe depend on the U.S. Government for substantially all of our business, and risks associated with conducting business with the U.S. Government could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe conduct most of our business with the U.S. Government, primarily the DoD. The majority of our business consists of the design, construction, repair, and maintenance of nuclear-powered ships and non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and coastal defense surface ships for the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as the refueling and overhaul and inactivation of nuclear-powered ships for the U.S. Navy. We also provide integrated solutions that enable today's connected, all-domain force, including C5ISR systems and operations; the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to battlefield decisions; defense and offensive cyberspace strategies and electronic warfare; uncrewed autonomous systems; live, virtual, and constructive training solutions; fleet sustainment; and critical nuclear operations. Substantially all of our revenues in 2024 were derived from products and services sold to the U.S. Government, and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, substantially all of our backlog as of December 31, 2024, was related to products and services deliverable to the U.S. Government. Our U.S. Government contracts are subject to various risks, including customer political and budgetary constraints and processes, changes in customer short-term and long-term strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, significant changes in contract scheduling, recessionary impacts on government spending, intense contract award and funding \n\n\n\ncompetition, challenges forecasting costs and schedules for bids on developmental and sophisticated technical work, and contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain legal or regulatory violations. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business with the U.S. Government and our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, with little or no prior notice, for convenience or for default based upon performance. In the event of termination of a contract for the U.S. Government's convenience, a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on incurred costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. Our unfunded backlog contains management’s estimate of revenues expected to be realized on unfunded contracts that may never be realized. Any termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program. A termination resulting from our default can expose us to various liabilities, including excess re-procurement costs, and could negatively affect our ability to compete for future contracts. Any contract termination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSignificant delays or reductions in appropriations for our programs and/or changes in customer priorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we depend on Congressional funding of our U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and other federal programs. U.S. Government programs are subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. When Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills before the beginning of a fiscal year, a continuing resolution can be enacted to provide stopgap funding for a specified period of time at a specified rate, often the prior year’s appropriations level. When the U.S. Government operates under a continuing resolution, limitations can be placed on production increases, multi-year procurements, and new program starts, which may result in delays or cancellation of new contract awards. When the U.S. Government fails to enact annual appropriations or a continuing resolution, a full or partial federal government shutdown may occur. A federal government shutdown could, in turn, result in the delay or cancellation of government programs, or the delay of contract payments, which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results of operations.\nCongress sometimes appropriates funds on an annual fiscal year basis for programs for which the performance period may extend over multiple years. Such programs are funded initially on a partial basis, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we or our subcontractors incur costs in excess of existing funding on a contract, we are generally at risk for reimbursement and may not recover those costs unless and until additional funds are appropriated. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding or funding for individual programs will be included, increased, or reduced as part of the annual budget process or through continuing resolutions or individual supplemental appropriations.\nIn addition, pressures on, as well as laws and plans relating to, the federal budget, potential changes in the threat environment, priorities and defense spending, the timing and substance of the annual budget process, use of continuing resolutions, and the federal debt limit, have impacted and could continue to impact the amount and timing of funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payments by our customers. For additional information relating to the U.S. defense budget, see the Business Environment section under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7. Current U.S. Government spending levels for defense-related or other programs may not be sustained, and future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide products or services or are less likely to be awarded contracts. Such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of uncertainty surrounding the federal budget, increasing political pressure and legislation, shifts in spending priorities from defense-related or other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds, the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors. For example, the military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas have resulted in increased security assistance to Ukraine and Israel, respectively. Changes in defense budgetary priorities as a result of such conflicts or otherwise could have an adverse impact on the programs in which we participate and, ultimately, our results. \nDemand for our products and services also can be affected by shifts in customer priorities resulting from changes in military strategy and planning. In response to the need for less expensive alternatives and the increasing proliferation of advanced weapons, future strategy reassessments by the DoD may result in decreased demand for our shipbuilding programs, including our aircraft carrier programs. We cannot predict the impact of changes to \n\n\n\ncustomer priorities on existing, follow-on, replacement, or future programs. A shift of priorities to programs in which we do not participate and related reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nChanges in estimates used in contract accounting and contract cost growth have affected and could continue to affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\n\nContract accounting requires risk-based judgments regarding estimated contract revenues and costs, and assumptions regarding schedule and technical matters. Our ability to estimate total revenues and costs at completion depends on many variables, including the size and nature of our contracts. For new shipbuilding programs, our estimates are based on contracts for the construction of ships that are not completely designed, which subjects our risk assessments, revenue and cost estimates, and related assumptions to the variability of the final ship design and an evolving scope of work. Our assessment, estimation, and assumption processes significantly impact our contract accounting, and materially different amounts can result if different assumptions are used or if actual events differ from our assumptions.\nWe aim to mitigate the risk associated with our use of estimates through our contractual terms, and have submitted, and may submit, requests for equitable adjustment, engineering change proposals, or other claims to seek recovery, in whole or in part, of our increased costs. We have also sought, and will seek, other means or contract vehicles, as appropriate, to compensate the Company for certain unexpected cost increases. However, our contracts may not enable full recovery or the government may disagree with our requests or may not have funding to cover them. \nChanges in our assumptions, circumstances, or estimates and the inability to recover increased cost growth have in the past had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See the Contracts section under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.\nChanges to DoD business practices could have a material effect on DoD's procurement process and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards.\nOur industry has experienced, and we expect will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices resulting from greater focus on affordability, efficiencies, business systems, recovery of costs, and a reprioritization of defense funding. These initiatives and changes to procurement practices may change the way U.S. Government contracts are solicited, negotiated, and managed, and may impact whether and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the U.S. Government, including the terms and conditions under which we do so, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Changes in procurement practices favoring incentive-based fee arrangements, different award fee criteria (such as the evaluation of environmental factors), non-traditional contract provisions, and cost mandates from the government may affect our profitability and the predictability of our profit rates. \nThe U.S. Government also is pursuing alternatives to shift additional responsibility and performance risks to contractors. For example, the DoD is accelerating development and acquisition of new technologies through rapid acquisition alternatives and procedures, including through other transaction authority agreements (“OTAs”). In recent years, the DoD has increased the frequency and size of OTAs, and we expect this trend to continue in the future. OTAs are exempt from many traditional procurement laws, including the FAR, and may be used, subject to certain conditions, for research, prototype development, and follow-on production for a successful prototype. OTA awards include, in certain instances, that a significant portion of the work under the OTA be performed by a non-traditional defense contractor or that a portion of the cost of the prototype project be funded by non-governmental sources. If we cannot successfully adapt to the DoD’s accelerated acquisition processes or if the DoD significantly increases the use of OTAs with non-traditional defense contractors or increases cost sharing mandates, we may lose new strategic business opportunities in high-growth areas and our future performance and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the DoD's business practice initiatives, the DCMA and DCAA have implemented cost recovery/cost savings initiatives to prioritize cost recovery/savings. As a result, we have experienced and may continue to experience a higher number of audits and/or lengthened periods of time required to close open audits. These audits may result in costs being challenged, debated, and in certain cases, withheld or modified, and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n\n\nCompetition within our markets or an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenues and market share.\n\nOur shipbuilding business operates in a highly competitive market, in part, due to the limited number of U.S. shipyards that compete for contracts to construct, overhaul, repair, maintain, and convert naval vessels. In addition, the competition for certain of our products, such as aircraft carriers, submarines, amphibious assault ships, surface combatants, and other ships, is heightened due to changes in budgetary pressures and priorities, and our programs and products may compete with each other for available funding in addition to other defense products and services provided by our competitors. We expect competition for future shipbuilding programs to continue to be intense.\nWe compete with another large defense contractor for contracts to build surface combatants, submarines, and large deck amphibious ships, and smaller shipyards have entered the market for surface combatants. We may compete in the future with the same contractor and other shipyards to build new and different classes of ships, as well as ships for which we are currently the sole source, including expeditionary warfare and amphibious assault ships. Moreover, reductions in U.S. defense spending that reduce the demand for the types of ships we build and services we provide increase our exposure to market competition risk. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully, we may generate lower revenues and lose market share, which would negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to compete for future defense contracts could be impacted.\nAlthough we are the only company currently capable of refueling nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, two existing U.S. Government shipyards may be able to refuel nuclear-powered aircraft carriers if they made substantial investments in facilities, personnel, and training. U.S. Government-owned shipyards currently engage in the refueling, overhaul, and inactivation of Los Angeles class (SSN 688) submarines and are capable of repairing and overhauling non-nuclear ships. If a U.S. Government-owned shipyard became capable of, and engaged, in the refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows would likely be adversely affected.\n\nWe also compete in the shipbuilding engineering, planning, and design market with companies that provide engineering support services. Such competition increases the risk we may not be the successful bidder on future U.S. Navy engineering proposals, including aircraft carrier research and development, submarine design, and surface combatant and amphibious assault ship program contracts.\n\nMission Technologies competes domestically and internationally against large A&D companies, primarily L3 Harris, Amentum, ManTech, Leidos, and, increasingly, small businesses serving the intelligence community. To a lesser extent, our lines of business compete on certain contracts with major prime A&D contractors, including Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, and Boeing. The success of our Mission Technologies division in competing depends, in part, on its ability to remain cost-competitive and differentiate its products and services offerings from other market participants. \nOur competitive environment also is affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. As the competitive environment intensifies, the number of bid protests may increase. Bid protests can result in an award decision being overturned, requiring a re-bid of the contract. Even when a bid protest does not result in a re-bid, resolution of the matter typically extends the time until contract performance can begin, which can reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise be performed.\nOur level of indebtedness and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or our ability to incur additional debt.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our current or future indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations, financings, or asset sales, which may be subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other unfavorable actions, including reducing funding for working capital, capital expenditures, and general corporate purposes; reducing our cash dividend rate and/or share repurchases; or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the defense industry could be impaired. In the event of a default on any of our indebtedness, the lenders who hold such debt could accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of our other indebtedness.\n\n\n\nWe have classified contracts with the U.S. government, which limits investor insight into portions of our business.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the U.S. Government and its agencies that are subject to security restrictions (e.g., contracts involving classified information and classified programs), which preclude the dissemination of information and technology that is classified for national security purposes under applicable law and regulation. In general, access to classified information, technology, facilities or programs requires appropriate personnel security clearances, is subject to additional contract oversight and potential liability and may also require appropriate facility clearances and other specialized infrastructure. In the event of a security incident involving classified information, technology, facilities, programs or personnel holding clearances, we may be subject to legal, financial, operational and reputational harm. We are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs, their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified business and our business overall. However, historically the business risks associated with our work on classified programs have not differed materially from those of our other government contracts.\nBusiness and Operational Risk Factors\nCost growth on flexibly priced contracts that does not result in higher contract prices due from customers reduces our profit and exposes us to the potential loss of future business.\nOur operating income is adversely affected when we incur certain contract costs or certain increases in contract costs that cannot be billed to customers. Contract cost growth has occurred and may occur in the future when expenses to complete a contract increase and/or differ materially from our initial estimates. Factors that have caused, and may in the future cause, contract cost growth include, but are not limited to, inflation, technical challenges, manufacturing difficulties, delays, workforce-related issues, including labor shortages and reduced productivity, changes in the nature and complexity of the work performed, the timeliness, availability and cost of materials or equipment, subcontractor performance or product quality issues, performance delays, availability and timing of customer funding, changes in trade policy, and natural disasters. A significant increase in contract costs from our original cost estimates on one or more contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. For example, our results for the year ended December 31, 2024, were adversely affected by significant challenges relating to labor availability, our supply chain, and inflation, among other challenges. We cannot clearly predict how long these challenges will continue, whether these challenges will change over time, or whether our actions to address these challenges will be successful. \nOur risk varies and our ability to recover costs on contracts with our U.S. Government customers depends upon the type of contract under which we are performing: firm fixed-price, fixed-price incentive, cost-type, or time and material. See the Contracts section under Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 for descriptions of the types of contracts that comprise our business.\nApproximately 48% of our revenues in 2024 were generated under fixed-price incentive contracts, approximately 47% were generated under cost-type contracts, approximately 2% were generated under time and material contracts, and approximately 3% were generated under firm fixed-price contracts. Fixed-price contracts generally tend to have more financial risk than cost-type contracts, including as a result of inflationary pressures, wage pressures and labor shortages, and supplier challenges. These contracts increase the risk that we may not recover all of our costs or will generate less profit or a loss if our costs exceed initial estimates. With cost-type contracts, allowable costs are generally subject to reimbursement plus an award or incentive fee, which is uncertain and may be earned over time. Under each type of contract, our operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to control costs, particularly if we are unable to negotiate an increase in contract price, or recover increased costs, with our customers. \nU.S. Government contracts often extend for years, and unforeseen events, such as technology difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, a significant increase in or sustained period of higher inflation, supplier issues, including equipment delays, challenging labor market conditions, unexpected rework, and cost overruns, have in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in contract prices becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. Higher interest rates resulting from inflationary pressures can also impact the fair values of our contracts. Moreover, if we fail to meet contract deadlines or specifications, we may be required to \n\n\n\nrenegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages, or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. \nCost overruns have adversely impacted, and may continue to impact, our results of operations, which are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts. This risk would be greater if our contracts shifted toward a greater percentage of fixed-price contracts, particularly firm fixed-price contracts. Cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing programs and win future contract awards. In addition, changes in contract financing policy for fixed-price contracts, such as changes in performance and progress payments policies, could significantly affect the timing of our cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations, in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties relating to final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability. \nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and challenges associated with our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel have harmed and may continue to negatively impact our business.\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, our performance is dependent upon our ability to identify, attract, train, and retain a qualified workforce with the requisite skills in multiple areas, including: engineering, nuclear, trades and crafts, manufacturing, information technology, and cybersecurity, and who are able to operate effectively consistent with our values and culture. Our performance also is dependent upon personnel who hold security clearances and receive substantial training to work on certain programs or tasks and can be difficult to replace on a timely basis if we experience unplanned attrition. \nA growing portion of our current workforce is nearing or eligible for retirement. To the extent we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we hire new qualified personnel, develop and train inexperienced employees, and successfully manage the short and long-term transfer of critical knowledge and skills. We have recently experienced situations where our personnel have failed to achieve expected performance improvements on certain of our long-term contracts, which resulted in unexpected inefficiency, and in some cases, to rework, that negatively impacted our ability to achieve certain performance milestones under those contracts. Our ability to overcome these challenges in the short and long term will have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow.\nCompetition for talent is intense, and this has affected, and may continue to affect, our ability to successfully attract or retain personnel with the requisite skills or clearances. We continue to face increased competition for talent, both with traditional defense companies and commercial companies, and with increasing wage rates. We also compete with commercial technology companies outside of the shipbuilding and defense industry for qualified technical positions. Such companies may be able to offer more attractive compensation and other benefits to candidates, including in the recruitment of our existing employees. As a result of the above factors, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant difficulties hiring and retaining personnel with relevant qualifications and experience, which has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow, and could impact our ability to perform under our contracts and compete for new contracts. We have also experienced higher labor, recruiting, and training costs to attract and retain such employees, which has negatively impacted our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow. A shortage of skilled employees has and may continue to impact our ability to perform our contracts and may impact our ability to compete for new contracts.\nOur earnings and profitability depend, in part, upon subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing.\n\nWe rely on third parties to provide raw materials, major components and sub-systems, hardware elements, and sub-assemblies for our products and to perform certain services we provide to our customers, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including applicable DoD cybersecurity requirements. Disruptions and performance issues from our suppliers and subcontractors, unanticipated cost growth for the products and services they provide, or inconsistencies between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers, have adversely impacted and may continue to impact our ability to meet our commitments to customers. Our ability to satisfy our obligations on a timely basis are adversely affected if one or \n\n\n\nmore of our suppliers or subcontractors are unable to provide agreed-upon products, materials, or services in a timely, compliant, and cost-effective manner, or they otherwise fail to satisfy contractual requirements. The inability of our suppliers or subcontractors to meet expectations could also result in our need to transition to alternate parties, if available, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay, or the need for us to provide other supplemental support to our existing suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nOur costs to manufacture our products can increase over the terms of our contracts, including as a result of increases in material costs and wages. Although we may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions, the difference in basis between our actual material costs and industry indices may expose us to cost recovery risk. Our bids for longer-term firm fixed-price contracts typically include assumptions for labor and other contract costs that historically have been sufficient to cover cost increases over the period of performance. If, however, recent inflationary conditions continue over the long-term, our cost assumptions may not be sufficient to cover potential contract cost growth. In addition, significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials, which may occur as a result of shortage or pricing, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nIn some cases, only one supplier may exist for certain components and parts required to manufacture our products. The inability of a sole source supplier to provide a necessary component or part on a timely, compliant, and cost-effective basis could increase our contract cost and affect our ability to satisfy our contract obligations.\nOur procurement practices are intended to provide materials, components, parts, and services that meet contract specifications and to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of unauthorized, non-compliant, or deficient goods and services. We rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and the obligations set forth in the HII Supplier Code of Conduct, through representations and certifications from our subcontractors and suppliers regarding such compliance. We also conduct technical assessments, inspections, and audits, as necessary, with subcontractors and suppliers. Notwithstanding the actions we take to mitigate the risk of receiving non-compliant materials, components, parts, and services, subcontractors and suppliers sometimes provide us with unauthorized, non-compliant, or deficient goods and services, which can increase our contract costs and impact our ability to satisfy our contract obligations to our customers.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to increase our current and future shipbuilding capacity. If we are unable to do so, or to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe expect that we will need to increase our shipbuilding capacity to meet current and future production demands. We are utilizing and may in the future utilize one or more strategies to increase such capacity including, among others, increasing investment in our current shipyards, identifying and retaining additional qualified personnel, utilizing third parties to support production needs and identifying efficiencies in our current production process to support increased production. We also may seek to increase our capacity through acquisitions, partnerships or other arrangements. Our ability to increase capacity is subject to risks and uncertainties. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to successfully expand production capacity, or to do so on a cost-effective basis. In addition, our ability to expand our shipbuilding capacity will also greatly depend on our ability to hire, train and retain an adequate number of personnel, in particular personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, background and skills. Should we be unable to hire such personnel, our business and financial results would be negatively impacted. \nMany of our contracts include performance obligations that incorporate innovative designs, state-of-the-art manufacturing expertise, or new technologies, or otherwise are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control, and failure to meet performance expectations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects.\n\nWe design, develop, and manufacture products and perform services that often involve innovative designs, new technologies, and complex manufacturing processes. Delays and issues with product development, technology implementation, manufacturing, or subcontractor components or services can impact our contract performance.\n\nFirst-in-class ships, also known as lead ships, usually include new technologies supplied by the U.S. Navy or other contractors or developed by us. Problems associated with development or implementation of these new technologies or design changes in the construction process can lead to delays in the design and construction schedule. The risks associated with new technologies or design changes during construction can both increase the cost of a ship and delay delivery.\n\n\n\n\nOur products cannot always be tested and proven and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems, including premature failure of elements that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, substandard quality or workmanship, and unexpected degradation of product performance. These failures could result in loss of life or property and could negatively affect our results of operations as a result of unanticipated expenses that we don't recover, diversion of management attention, loss of follow-on work, and, in the case of certain contracts, reimbursement to the customer of contract costs and fee payments previously received.\n\nWe periodically experience quality issues with respect to products and services that we sell to our U.S. Government customers. These issues can and have required significant resources to determine the source of the deficiencies and implement corrective actions. We may discover quality issues in the future related to our products and services that require analysis and corrective action. Such issues and our responses and corrective actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nChanges in key estimates and assumptions associated with postretirement benefit plans, such as discount rates and assumed long-term returns on assets, actual investment returns on our pension plan assets, and legislative and regulatory actions could significantly affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur pension and retiree health care costs are dependent upon various estimates and assumptions, including regarding discount rates, mortality and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, which to a large extent reflect the financial markets and economic conditions. Changes to these estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets could significantly impact our retirement related expense, the funded status of benefit plans, and contributions to our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, which could have material adverse effects on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, pension cost recoveries under CAS for our U.S. Government contracts occur in different periods from those in which pension expense is recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") or the periods in which we make contributions to our benefit plans, and changes to estimates and assumptions and differences between expected and actual returns could adversely affect the timing of those pension cost recoveries.\nWe have taken certain actions intended to mitigate the risk related to our defined benefit pension plans including pension risk transfer transactions whereby we purchase group annuity contracts (“GACs”) from insurance companies using assets from the pension trust. We expect to continue to evaluate such transactions in the future. Although we are relieved of all responsibility for the associated pension obligations under the GACs we have purchased to date, we may in the future purchase GACs whereby the insurance company reimburses the pension plans but we remain responsible for paying benefits under the plans to covered retirees and beneficiaries and are subject to the risk that the insurance company will default on its obligations to reimburse the pension trusts. While we believe pension risk transfer transactions are beneficial, future transactions, depending on their size, could result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust and/or require us to recognize noncash settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period. \nWe could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber security threats, and related disruptions.\nAs a defense contractor, we face significant cyber and other security threats. These threats include, among others, threats to our information technology infrastructure, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to classified, proprietary or other sensitive information or otherwise compromise the integrity, confidentiality and/or availability of our systems, hardware and networks or those of our suppliers and subcontractors; insider threats; ransomware; threats to the safety of our directors, officers and employees; threats to our facilities, infrastructure, products (we produce and use), and subcontractors or other suppliers; and threats from terrorist acts, espionage, civil unrest and other acts of aggression. \nOur information technology infrastructure is critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations. We rely on this infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including classified and other sensitive information of the U.S. Government. We face substantial cyber security threats, including threats to our and the U.S. Government's proprietary and classified information from advanced nation state threat actors and non-state actors, sophisticated cybercrime syndicates, hacktivists, and insiders. These cyber security threats are continuously evolving and include security breaches (whether through \n\n\n\ncyber attack, cyber intrusion, or insider threat) via the internet; malicious software, including ransomware; computer viruses; attachments to emails; persons inside our organization or with access to systems inside our organization; subcontractors or suppliers; or other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems or those of our suppliers or subcontractors, including through the use of new and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. Some of these threats are zero-day attacks associated with previously unknown vulnerabilities in third party software products we utilize in our business. \nWe have experienced cybersecurity attacks and expect we will continue to experience additional attacks in the future. Breaches of our information technology may lead to the following types of adverse consequences: losses or misuse of sensitive information or capabilities; theft or corruption of data; harm to personnel, infrastructure or products; financial costs and liabilities; protracted interruptions of our operations and performance; significant recovery and restoration expenses; degraded performance on existing contracts; the misuse of our products; and exposure to reputational damage, potential liability, or the loss of current or future contracts, including work on sensitive or classified systems for the U.S. Government, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWhile we implement robust countermeasures to mitigate the risks posed by cyber security threats, external and internal threat actors continuously seek to evade our cyber security countermeasures to gain unauthorized and unlawful access to our information technology infrastructure, assets, and data, both on premises and in the cloud. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cybersecurity attacks and cyber intrusions or disruptions, regularly occur and will continue to occur in the future and the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we are not always able to anticipate techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures. \nOur suppliers, subcontractors, and other business partners also face cyber and other security threats. Although we undertake cooperative efforts with our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other business partners to facilitate their understanding of cyber security threats they face and potential cyber security countermeasures to mitigate potential cyber attacks and other security threats, we rely substantially on the safeguards implemented by these organizations, which affects the security of our information. These organizations have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards, and their relationships with U.S. Government contractors increases the likelihood that they are or will be impacted by the same cyber security threats we face.\nWe also face increasing and evolving disclosure and reporting obligations related to cybersecurity events. Despite rigorous processes, we may be unable to meet existing or future disclosure obligations and risk potentially having our disclosures when made misinterpreted. National security or public safety considerations may further affect, or in some instances prevent, our public disclosure of a cybersecurity incident in certain circumstances.\nWe could also encounter threats to our physical security, including our facilities and personnel, and threats from workplace violence, civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, and other local security issues, any of which could disrupt our business. Our customers and suppliers face similar risks that, if realized, could also adversely impact our operations. Any such events could cause delays or disruption or otherwise impact our business, and or all of which may require us to incur greater costs for security or to shut down operations for a period of time.\nThe occurrence and impact of these various risks are difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe utilize artificial intelligence, which could expose us to liability or adversely affect our business, especially if we are unable to compete effectively with others in adopting artificial intelligence.\nWe utilize artificial intelligence, including generative artificial intelligence, machine learning, and similar tools and technologies that collect, aggregate, analyze, or generate data or other materials or content (collectively, “AI”) in connection with our business, including to enhance productivity and operational efficiency and optimize processes utilized in our business. There is inherent risk and uncertainty involved in using AI and we cannot provide assurances that our use of AI will enhance our products or services, produce the intended results, or keep pace with our competitors. We have implemented an AI Governance and Enablement Program to oversee the use of AI in our business. If the AI tools that we use are deficient, inaccurate, or controversial, we could incur operational inefficiencies, competitive harm, legal liability, brand or reputational harm, or other adverse impacts on our business and financial results. If we do not have sufficient rights to use the data or other material or content on which the AI \n\n\n\ntools we use rely, we also may incur liability through the violation of applicable laws and regulations, third-party intellectual property, data privacy, or other rights, or contracts to which we are a party.\nIn addition, AI regulation is rapidly evolving worldwide as legislators and regulators increasingly focus on these powerful emerging technologies. The technologies underlying AI and its uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including intellectual property, data privacy and security, consumer protection, competition, and equal opportunity laws, and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws and regulations. AI is the subject of ongoing review by various U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies, and various U.S. states and other foreign jurisdictions are applying, or are considering applying, their platform moderation, data privacy, and security laws and regulations to AI or are considering general legal\nframeworks for AI. We may not be able to anticipate how to respond to these rapidly evolving frameworks, and we may need to expend resources to adjust our operations or offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. Furthermore, because AI technology itself is highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all of the legal, operational, or technological risks that may arise relating to the use of AI.\nOur business is subject to disruptions caused by natural disasters, environmental disasters, and other events that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nWe have significant operations located in regions of the United States that have been and may in the future be exposed to damaging storms, such as hurricanes and floods, the intensity and frequency of which are being exacerbated by climate change, other impacts of climate change, including rising sea waters, and environmental disasters, such as oil spills. Natural disasters can disrupt our workforce, electrical and other power distribution networks, computer and internet operations and accessibility, and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations, which can adversely affect our contract performance and, as a result, our financial results. Environmental disasters, particularly oil spills in waterways and bodies of water we use for transporting and testing our ships, can cause schedule delays under our contracts with the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard.\nDamage and disruption resulting from natural and environmental disasters may be significant. Disruptions could also impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs, or result in a lack of available coverage. If insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms is unavailable or insufficient to recover material costs associated with natural or environmental disasters or other events, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nOur suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to natural and environmental disasters that could affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform their contracts. Performance failures by our subcontractors or suppliers due to natural or environmental disasters may adversely affect our ability to perform our contracts, which could reduce our profitability in the event damages or other costs are not recoverable from the subcontractor or supplier, our customer, or insurers. Such events could also result in a termination of the prime contract and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks.\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks, including global health crises like COVID-19. Such risks include disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work or work effectively, temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers or suppliers, delays in supplier deliveries, and delays in customer contract awards. We experienced higher employee absentee rates as a result of COVID-19, which increased our costs and generated delay and disruption, impacted our performance on our contracts, and degraded our financial performance.\nThe COVID-19 health crisis also created challenges for our suppliers relative to their workforces, access to necessary components, materials, and other supplies at reasonable prices, and access to support services, such as shipping and transportation. These challenges have impacted the ability of suppliers to provide agreed-upon goods and services in a timely, compliant, and cost-effective manner. We may in the future incur additional costs and performance challenges, including as a result of higher prices, schedule delays, or the need to identify and develop alternative suppliers.\n\n\n\nIf an epidemic, pandemic or similar outbreak were to occur, we could incur similar impacts in the future, in connection with health epidemics, pandemics, or similar outbreaks, and related cost increases may not be fully recoverable under our contracts or adequately covered by insurance, which could impact our profitability. \nOur business could be negatively impacted if we are unsuccessful negotiating new collective bargaining agreements.\n\nApproximately 45% of our employees are covered by a total of nine collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements generally expire after three to five years and are subject to renegotiation at that time. We generally have been able to renegotiate renewals to expiring agreements without significant disruption of operating activities. While we believe we maintain satisfactory relationships with our represented workers, it is possible we may experience difficulties with renewals and renegotiating expiring collective bargaining agreements. We have experienced in the past work stoppages, strikes, and other labor disruptions associated with the collective bargaining of new labor agreements. If we experience such events in the future, or if our employees pursue new collective representation, we could incur additional costs or work delays that could adversely affect programs served by employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nChanges in future business conditions could cause business investments, recorded goodwill, and/or purchased intangible assets to become impaired, resulting in losses and write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\n\nOur business strategy includes strategic business acquisitions and non-controlling investments in businesses. Acquisitions involve estimates, assumptions, and judgments to arrive at acquisition prices, which are allocated among acquired assets, including goodwill, based upon fair market values. As of December 31, 2024, goodwill and purchased intangible assets from prior business acquisitions accounted for approximately 22% and 6%, respectively, of our total assets. Notwithstanding our acquisition process and business integration efforts, actual operating results of businesses we acquire or in which we invest may vary from expectations. In such events, we may be required to write down our carrying values of the related goodwill, purchased intangible assets, or investments. A significant decrease in expected cash flows or unfavorable changes in market conditions, including declines in the trading price of our common stock, may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill or purchased intangible assets. Significant write-offs of goodwill or other purchased intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. \nLegal and Regulatory Risk Factors\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are heavily regulated and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or negative findings from a U.S. Government audit or investigation.\n\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to significant legal regulatory requirements, including specific regulations related to our nuclear operations. Government contracting requirements increase our contract performance costs and compliance costs and risks, and change on a routine basis. In addition, our nuclear operations are subject to an enhanced regulatory environment, which results in further performance and compliance requirements and higher costs. New laws, regulations, or procurement requirements, or changes to existing ones (including, for example, regulations related to cybersecurity, information protection, environment, cost accounting, counterfeit parts, specialty metals, among others), can increase our performance costs and compliance costs and risks, and reduce our profitability. In addition, If we are found to have engaged in illegal activities, or are found to not be presently responsible, as defined under the FAR, we may be subject to reductions in contract values, contract modifications or terminations, penalties, fines, repayments, compensatory, treble, or other damages, or suspension or debarment. \n\nWe operate in a heavily regulated environment and are overseen and routinely audited by the U.S. Government and its agencies, including the U.S. Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, the DCAA, and the DCMA. These agencies evaluate our performance, cost structures, and compliance, as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings, which could result in fines, penalties, repayments, sanctions, compensatory, treble, or other damages. Allegations of impropriety can also cause significant reputational damage.\nThe U.S. Government also has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems. The U.S. Government has, in certain instances, withheld \n\n\n\ncontract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems, which can have a material impact on the timing of our cash receipts.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government has from time to time recommended that certain of our contract prices be reduced, or that certain costs allocated to our contracts be disallowed. In response to U.S. Government audits, investigations, and inquiries, we have adjusted our contract prices and costs allocated to our government contracts. Such audits, investigations, and inquiries may result in future reductions of our contract prices, which could be substantial. Costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded to the customer if previously reimbursed.\n\nIf we or those with whom we do business do not comply with the laws, regulations, rules, contract terms and processes to which we are subject or if customer business practices or requirements change significantly, including with respect to allowable costs, it could affect our ability to compete, have a significant adverse impact on our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nWe are subject to investigations, claims, litigation, disputes and other legal proceedings that could ultimately be resolved against us.\nThe size, nature, and complexity of our business make us highly susceptible to investigations, claims, litigation, disputes, and other legal proceedings. We are and may become subject to various legal proceedings across a broad array of matters, including but not limited to, administrative, civil, and criminal litigation, environmental claims, income tax proceedings, compliance proceedings, customer claims, enforcement actions, audits, investigations and other legal proceedings, which can divert financial and management resources and result in fines, penalties, compensatory, treble, or other damages, or nonmonetary sanctions. Government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges. Suspension or debarment or criminal resolutions in particular could have a material adverse effect on our business because of our reliance on government contracts and authorizations. Any litigation, claim, dispute, audit, or investigation, even if pending or not ultimately substantiated or if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or acquire adequate insurance in the future. The negative resolution of investigations, claims, litigation, disputes or other legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 13: Investigations, Claims, and Litigation in Item 8.\n\nEnvironmental costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nOur operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal, and remediation of certain materials, substances, and wastes used in our operations. Future environmental laws or regulations could also impact us. Environmental laws and regulations may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges and/or to decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous material releases. We expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future laws and regulations for environmental protection and remediation, and such costs could be substantial, depending on the future proliferation of environmental requirements and the extent to which we discover currently unknown environmental conditions.\n\nShipbuilding operations require the use of hazardous materials. Our shipyards also generate significant quantities of wastewater, which we treat before discharging in compliance with applicable permits. To manage these materials, our shipyards have an extensive network of above ground and underground storage tanks, some of which have leaked and required remediation in the past. In addition, our use of hazardous materials has sometimes resulted in releases in our shipyards and occasionally in adjacent rivers and waterways in which we operate.\n\nVarious federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the transportation, storage, and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. Substantial fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance, and certain environmental laws impose joint and several \"strict liability\" for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations impose liability upon a party for environmental cleanup and remediation costs and damage without regard to the negligence or fault of such party and could expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties. Moreover, if we violate the Clean Air Act or the Clean \n\n\n\nWater Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be placed by the EPA on a list of facilities that generally cannot be used in performing on U.S. Government contracts until the violation is corrected.\nOur business may be affected by environmental impacts, including climate change, and evolving legal and regulatory requirements and stakeholder sentiment. Changes in environmental and climate-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, energy taxes, product efficiency standards, mandatory disclosure obligations, and other requirements, could increase our operational and compliance expenditures and those of our suppliers, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. We also may be impacted by stockholders or other stakeholders that oppose our sustainability efforts and/or legislation or other initiatives that oppose environmental, social and governance efforts, any or all of which could adversely impact our business. \n\nThe adoption of new environmental or climate change laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, imposition of new cleanup requirements, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental matters, our inability to recover related costs under our government contracts, or the financial insolvency of other responsible parties could cause us to incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur nuclear operations subject us to environmental, regulatory, financial, and other risks.\n\nThe design, construction, refueling and overhaul, repair, and inactivation of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines, our nuclear facilities used to support such activities, our nuclear operations at DoE sites, and our activities in the commercial nuclear market subject us to various risks, including:\n•Potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations and the storage, handling, and disposal of radioactive materials, including nuclear assemblies and their components;\n•Unplanned expenditures relating to maintenance, operations, security, and repairs, including repairs required by the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or the DoE;\n•Reputational damage;\n•Potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear incident whether or not it is within our control; and\n•Regulatory noncompliance and loss of authorizations or indemnifications necessary for our operations.\nFailure to properly store, handle, and dispose of nuclear materials could pose a health risk to humans and wildlife and could cause personal injury and property damage, including environmental contamination. If a nuclear accident were to occur, its severity could be significantly affected by the volume of the materials and the speed of remedial actions taken by us and emergency response personnel, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as weather and wind conditions. Actions we might take in response to an accident could result in significant costs.\nOur nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, the DoE, and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the event of noncompliance, these agencies may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, or shut down our operations, depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance. In addition, new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, DoE, and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission could require substantial capital and other expenditures. \nSubject to certain requirements and limitations, our contracts with the U.S. Navy and DoE generally provide for indemnity by the U.S. Government for costs arising out of or resulting from our nuclear operations. We may not, however, be indemnified for all liabilities we may incur in connection with our nuclear operations. To mitigate risks related to our commercial nuclear operations, we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators and our own limited insurance for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators. Such insurance, however, may not be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption relating to our commercial nuclear operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n\n\nOur reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents, suppliers, subcontractors or business partners.\n\nWe have implemented detailed compliance plans and related compliance controls, policies, procedures, and training, in addition to contractual terms, as applicable, designed to prevent and detect misconduct by our employees, agents, business partners, and others working on our behalf, including suppliers and subcontractors, that would violate the applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing improper payments to government officials, the protection of export controlled or classified information, false claims, procurement integrity cost accounting and billing, competition, and information security and data privacy. However, we cannot ensure that we will prevent all such misconduct committed by our employees, agents, suppliers, subcontractors, business partners or others working with us or on our behalf. We have been, and may in the future be, impacted by such misconduct. The risk of improper conduct may increase as we expand our operations into foreign jurisdictions, including as we pursue opportunities with local and new partners. In the ordinary course we form and are members of joint ventures. Notwithstanding our robust processes, we may be unable to prevent misconduct or violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures (including their officers, directors and employees) or our business partners. Any improper actions by our employees, agents, business partners, those with whom we do business and others working on our behalf could subject us to administrative, civil, or criminal investigations and enforcement actions, monetary and non-monetary penalties, including suspension or debarment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Moreover, actions that are inconsistent with our culture and values, including with respect to product safety or quality, legal or regulatory compliance, financial reporting, or people management, may cause us significant reputational damage.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, have affected and could affect our tax expense and profitability and cash flows.\nIn addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax liabilities will change periodically as a result of a number of factors, including the measurement of our defined benefit pension plans, actual cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, changes in the timing of contract taxable income, and changes in the amount and timing of depreciation and amortization deductions. We are also regularly under audit or examination by taxing authorities, including foreign tax authorities. The final determination of tax liabilities and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. See Note 11: Income Tax under Item 8 for further information regarding our estimated income tax liabilities and a discussion of tax years that are currently under examination by taxing authorities.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could affect our ability to compete.\nWe own patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property related to our business, and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The U.S. Government generally receives non-exclusive licenses to certain intellectual property we develop in the performance of U.S. Government contracts, and the U.S. Government may use or, in some cases, authorize third parties to use such intellectual property. The U.S. Government can take aggressive positions both as to the intellectual property to which they believe government use rights apply and to the acquisition of broad license rights. To the extent the U.S. Government is successful, the intellectual property on which we depend and our access to and use of certain supplier intellectual property could be negatively affected.\n\nWe also rely upon proprietary technology, information, processes, and know-how that are not protected by patents. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, subcontractors, and other parties, as well as through other measures. These agreements and other measures may not, however, adequately protect the trade secrets on which we depend. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by competitors.\nOur intellectual property is also subject to challenge, invalidation, infringement, misappropriation, or circumvention by third parties. In the event of infringement, misappropriation, breach of a confidentiality agreement, or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to protect our \n\n\n\nintellectual property. Litigation to determine the scope of our rights or to protect our rights, even if successful, could be costly and a diversion of management's attention. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our business could be adversely affected.\n\nWe also use certain intellectual property licensed to us by third parties. In the case of such licensed intellectual property, we may be unable in the future to secure the necessary licenses to use such intellectual property, or to secure the licenses on commercially reasonable terms.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law, as well as regulatory requirements, could delay or prevent a change in control.\n\nCertain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders might consider favorable. For example, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws currently require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations, and authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock and us. \nOur nuclear shipbuilding operations are considered vitally important to the U.S. Navy. As a result, our Navy contracts include notice and approval rights for the Navy and conditions regarding the Navy's obligations to indemnify us for losses relating to our naval nuclear operations, in the event of a change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations. Such provisions require us to provide the U.S. Navy with notice of any potential change of control of our nuclear shipbuilding operations and receive the Navy's consent to transfer certain related licenses to facilitate the Navy's ability to confirm that a potential buyer would continue to conduct our operations in a satisfactory manner.\n\nProvisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Restated Bylaws and our existing contracts with the U.S. Navy may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change of control of our company that may be beneficial to our stockholders and could have a negative impact on our stock price.\nOur Restated Bylaws include an exclusive forum requirement for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for such disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur Restated Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or as to which the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery, (iv) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or Restated Bylaws, (v) any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in Section 115 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or (vi) any action governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, which provides for exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. \nThe exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our Restated Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs and liabilities associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our significant risks or our insurers may deny coverage of material losses we incur, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial position.\n\nWe seek to insure our significant risks and potential liabilities that are insurable, including, among others, property loss from natural disasters, product liability, and business interruption resulting from an insured property loss. In some circumstances, we may be indemnified for losses by the U.S. Government, subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Not every risk or liability can be protected by insurance, and, for insurable risks, the limits of coverage we can reasonably purchase may not be sufficient to cover the full amount of our actual losses or liabilities, including, for example, in the case of a catastrophic hurricane. In addition, the nature of our business can make it difficult to quantify the disruptive impact and loss resulting from such events. Limitations on the availability of insurance coverage may result in substantial uninsured losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Even in cases for which we have insurance coverage, disputes with insurance carriers over coverage may affect the timing of cash flows and cause us to incur significant expense to pursue insurance claims. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in the event of litigation with an insurance carrier may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nMarket volatility and adverse capital market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and may expose us to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers and subcontractors.\nThe financial markets experience high levels of volatility and disruption from time to time, reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers. We access these markets from time to time to support certain business activities, including funding acquisitions and capital projects and refinancing existing indebtedness. We may also access these markets to acquire credit support for our workers' compensation self-insurance program and letters of credit. A number of factors could cause us to incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty accessing public and private debt markets, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook, or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, meet contractual commitments, make future investments or desirable acquisitions, or respond to competitive challenges.\n\nTightening capital markets could also adversely affect the ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing. Delays in the ability of our suppliers or subcontractors to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing, could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with us and, as a result, our ability to satisfy our contractual obligations. The inability of our suppliers and subcontractors to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers and subcontractors, which could result in us incurring significant incremental costs and delays.\nIf we fail to manage acquisitions, joint ventures, equity investments, and other transactions successfully or if acquired businesses or equity investments fail to perform as expected, our financial results, business, and future prospects could be harmed.\nAs part of our business strategy, we identify and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, and investments. When evaluating such transactions, we make significant judgments regarding the values of business opportunities, technologies, and other assets, the risks and costs of potential liabilities, and the future prospects of strategic acquisitions. We often compete with other potential buyers for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies; negotiate transaction terms; complete and close complex transactions; integrate acquired companies and employees; and realize anticipated operating synergies efficiently and effectively. Acquisition, joint venture, and investment transactions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. Unidentified or identified but un-indemnified or uninsured pre-closing liabilities could affect our future financial results, particularly through successor liability under procurement laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act or Truth in Negotiations Act, anti-corruption, environmental, tax, import-export, and technology transfer laws, which provide for civil and criminal penalties and the potential for debarment. We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, employee retention, transaction-related or other litigation, and other liabilities. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\n\n\nJoint ventures and other non-controlling investments operate under shared control with other parties. These investments typically include many of the same risks and uncertainties we incur, but may also expose us to additional risks not present if we retained full control. A joint venture partner may have economic or other business interests that are inconsistent with our interests, and we may be unable to prevent strategic decisions that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected by, or liable for, actions taken by joint ventures that we do not control, including violations of anti-corruption, import and export, taxation, and anti-boycott laws.\nWe can provide no assurance we will continue to increase our dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nThe payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock are subject to limitations under applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors, considered in the context of current conditions, including our earnings, other operating results, and capital requirements. Declines in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce stockholders’ equity. A deficit in stockholders’ equity could limit our ability under Delaware law to pay dividends and repurchase shares in the future. In addition, the timing and amount of share repurchases under board-approved share repurchase programs are within the discretion of management and depend upon many factors, including our share price, results of operations, capital requirements, and general business conditions, as well as applicable law.",
