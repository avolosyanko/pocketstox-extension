BUSINESS\n(Dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted)\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nGeneral Dynamics is a global aerospace and defense company that specializes in high-end design, engineering and manufacturing to deliver state-of-the-art solutions to our customers. We offer a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation; ship construction and repair; land combat vehicles, weapons systems and munitions; and technology products and services. Our leadership positions in attractive business aviation and defense markets enable us to deliver superior and enduring shareholder returns.\nOur company consists of 10 business units, which are organized into four operating segments: Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems and Technologies. We refer to the latter three collectively as our defense segments. To optimize market focus, customer intimacy, agility and operating expertise, each business unit is responsible for the development and execution of its strategy and operating results. This structure allows for a lean corporate function, which sets the overall strategy and governance for the company and is responsible for allocating and deploying capital.\nOur business units seek to deliver superior operating results by building industry-leading franchises. To achieve this goal, we invest in advanced technologies, pursue a culture of continuous improvement, and strive to be the low-cost, high-quality provider in each of our markets. The result is long-term value creation measured by strong earnings and cash flow and an attractive return on capital.\nOver the past decade, we have invested to create, renew or expand our portfolio of products and services across our businesses. This includes product development investments in Aerospace to bring to market an all-new lineup of business jet aircraft, capital investments in Marine Systems to support significant growth in U.S. Navy ship and submarine construction plans over the next two decades, development of next-generation platforms and technologies to meet customers’ emerging requirements in Combat Systems, and strategic acquisitions to achieve critical mass and build out a complete spectrum of solutions for our Technologies customers. We expect to realize an attractive return from these investments in each of our segments, and we will continue to evaluate our capital deployment opportunities to deliver long-term growth and enduring value to our shareholders.\nFollowing is additional information on each of our operating segments. For a supplemental discussion of segment performance and backlog, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.\nAEROSPACE\nOur Aerospace segment is recognized as a leading producer of business jets and the standard bearer in new technology aircraft, aircraft repair, customer support and custom completion services. The segment consists of our Gulfstream and Jet Aviation business units. We have earned our reputation through:\n![alt  10K_Aerospace_01.08.25.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/40533/000004053325000008/gd-20241231_g2.jpg)\n![alt  10K_Aerospace Map_01.15.25.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/40533/000004053325000008/gd-20241231_g3.jpg)\n•superior aircraft design, manufacturing excellence, quality, performance, safety and reliability;\n•technologically advanced flight deck and cabin systems; and\n•industry-leading customer support.\nWe believe the key to long-term value creation in the business jet industry is steady investment in new aircraft models and technologies and in customer service capabilities. Since acquiring Gulfstream more than 20 years ago, we have made significant investments in research and development (R&D), state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and maintenance and support through a combination of product development efforts, capital expansion and Jet Aviation’s global support network. We are also the industry leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and energy efficient engines.\nWe are committed to continual investment in R&D to create new aircraft that consistently broaden customer offerings while raising the bar for safety and performance. The result is the unprecedented development of an all-new lineup of the most technologically advanced business jet aircraft in the world. The Gulfstream family of aircraft offer industry-leading cabin, cockpit and safety technologies and the longest ranges at the fastest speeds in their respective classes.\nThe following represents Gulfstream’s current product line, along with the maximum range, maximum speed, cabin length (excluding baggage), and total number of city-pair speed records held for each aircraft: \nGulfstream’s in-service aircraft hold 405 city-pair speed records, more than any other business jet manufacturer, including the National Aeronautic Association’s polar and westbound around-the-world speed records.\nThe most recent addition to the in-service Gulfstream fleet is the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G700, which entered service following U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification in March 2024. It combines our most spacious cabin with our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck, the industry’s most technologically advanced flight deck, and the superior high-speed performance of all-new engines to create best-in-class capabilities. \nIn 2021, we introduced two new aircraft, the ultra-long-range, ultra-large-cabin G800 and the large-cabin G400, completing a nearly two decade effort to develop an all new family of Gulfstream aircraft. \nBoth aircraft feature our industry-leading high-speed range and efficiency, safety enhancements, and our advanced Symmetry Flight Deck. The G800 is Gulfstream’s longest-range aircraft, with an 8,000 nautical mile range at Mach 0.85. The G800 replaces the G650 and G650ER, which currently operate in 55 countries with more than 580 aircraft of this family in service. The G400 is a clean-sheet (i.e., all new) design developed in concert with the G500 and G600, thus expanding the commonality across the Gulfstream family of aircraft. The G400 will join a market segment in which Gulfstream has not participated for several decades. Both aircraft will enter service following FAA certification. \nThe G500 and G600 entered service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. These clean sheet aircraft replaced the G450 and G550 models, whose combined family has an installed base of more than 1,650 aircraft around the world. Our investment in the development of these aircraft included a new wing, new avionics, new fuselage and new ergonomically designed larger interiors, as well as systems and technologies to improve the manufacturing process and quality of the aircraft. As a result, the G500 and G600 are faster, more fuel efficient, and have greater cabin volume, reduced emissions, more range and improved flight controls compared with the aircraft they replaced. At year-end 2024, cumulative deliveries of the G500 and G600 aircraft totaled more than 300. \nOur disciplined and consistent approach to new product development has allowed us to introduce repeatedly first-to-market capabilities that set industry standards for safety, performance, quality, speed and comfort. Product enhancement and development efforts include initiatives in advanced avionics, composites, flight-control and vision systems, acoustics, and cabin technologies.\nGulfstream designs, develops and manufactures aircraft in Savannah, Georgia, including all large-cabin models. The mid-cabin G280 is assembled by a non-U.S. partner. All models are outfitted in Gulfstream’s and Jet Aviation’s facilities. As Gulfstream’s aircraft portfolio and customer base have grown and become increasingly global in reach over the years, we have invested in our facilities and operations around the world. At our Savannah campus, we added new purpose-built manufacturing facilities, increased aircraft service capacity, opened a customer-support distribution center and expanded our R&D capabilities.\nWe offer comprehensive support for the more than 3,000 Gulfstream aircraft in service around the world and operate an extensive network of factory-owned service centers. We continue to invest in these maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities and inventory to accommodate fleet growth. We also operate a 24/7 year-round customer support center and offer on-call Gulfstream aircraft technicians ready to deploy around the world for customer service requirements under our Field and Airborne Support Team (FAST) rapid-response unit.\nIn addition to expanding the reach of Gulfstream’s aircraft maintenance network outside the United States, Jet Aviation provides a comprehensive suite of innovative aircraft services for aircraft owners and operators around the world. With approximately 50 locations throughout North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region, our offerings include maintenance, completion, aircraft management, charter, staffing and fixed-base operator (FBO) services. \nJet Aviation manages approximately 310 business aircraft globally on behalf of individuals and corporate owners. We operate a leading global FBO network of approximately 30 facilities on four continents and support all aircraft types with a full range of maintenance services, including 24/7 global aircraft-on-ground support. We also operate one of the world’s largest custom completion and refurbishment centers for both narrow- and wide-body aircraft and perform modifications, upgrades and lifecycle sustainment support for various government fleets. We continue to grow our global footprint through acquisitions, expansions and significant renovations in strategic business aviation markets most \nfrequented by these customers. In 2024, we acquired FBO operations in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and broke ground on a new facility in Miami, Florida, at Opa Locka Executive Airport, expanding options in the Upper Midwest and on the East Coast for customers based in and traveling across these regions. \nThe following map displays the broad reach of our combined Gulfstream and Jet Aviation services network, including authorized service centers: \nThe Aerospace segment places a priority on sustainability throughout its manufacturing and service operations, producing aircraft that maximize fuel efficiency while offering customers options to reduce or eliminate their carbon footprints. Gulfstream and Jet Aviation have been at the forefront of the industry by adopting and expanding the availability of SAF, which achieves as much as an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per gallon over its lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. Gulfstream’s service and test aircraft have flown more than two million nautical miles on SAF since 2016, and in 2019, Gulfstream became the first business jet manufacturer to make SAF available to customers. In November 2023, Gulfstream conducted the world’s first transatlantic flight using 100% SAF. Gulfstream also offers operators the ability to achieve carbon-neutral travel by facilitating the purchase of carbon-offset credits. In addition to actively expanding the availability of SAF at its FBO locations, Jet Aviation allows customers to purchase SAF at locations where it is not available through a book-and-claim system. Since 2019, Jet Aviation has uploaded more than 11 million gallons of blended SAF to its customers.\nRevenue for the Aerospace segment was 24% of our consolidated revenue in 2024, 20% in 2023 and 22% in 2022. Revenue by major products and services was as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31                 2024   2023                    2022                 \nAircraft manufacturing           $7,811                   $5,710                  $5,876   \nAircraft services                 3,438                    2,911                   2,691   \nTotal Aerospace                 $11,249                   $8,621                  $8,567   \nMARINE SYSTEMS\nOur Marine Systems segment is the leading designer and builder of nuclear-powered submarines and a leader in surface combatant and auxiliary ship design and construction for the U.S. Navy. We also provide maintenance, modernization and lifecycle support services for Navy ships and maintain the most sophisticated marine engineering expertise in the world to support future capabilities. Our ability to design, build and maintain our nation’s most technologically sophisticated warships is a critical element of the U.S. defense industrial base. In addition to Navy ships, we have designed and built ocean-going Jones Act ships for commercial customers. Marine Systems consists of three business units — Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works and NASSCO.\nIn support of our Navy customer’s significant increase in demand for submarines and surface ships, we have made substantial investments to expand our facilities, grow and train our workforce, and expand our supply chain. The resulting increase in capacity and capabilities will support the unprecedented growth expected in our shipbuilding business, particularly submarines, over the next two decades.\nElectric Boat is the prime contractor and lead shipyard on all Navy nuclear-powered submarine programs. The business is responsible for all aspects of design and engineering and leads the construction of both Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarines and Virginia-class attack submarines.\nThe Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine is a 12-boat program that the Navy considers its top acquisition priority. Accordingly, the program has received the highest possible rating from the government’s Defense Priorities and Allocations System. These submarines will provide strategic deterrent capabilities for decades, with the first boat expected to deliver in 2028 to begin replacement of the current Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine fleet as it reaches the end of its service life. Construction is scheduled to span two decades, and the value of the Navy’s program of record is in excess of $125 billion.\nThe Navy procures Virginia-class submarines in multi-boat blocks. Along with an industry partner, we are currently working on Blocks IV and V in the program, with 14 Virginia-class submarines in our backlog scheduled for delivery through 2032. Ten of the planned boats in Block V will include the Virginia Payload Module, an 84-foot Electric Boat-designed-and-built hull section that adds four additional payload tubes, more than tripling the strike capacity of these submarines and providing unique capabilities to support special missions. \nWe have invested significant capital over the past several years in expanded and modernized facilities at Electric Boat to support the growth in submarine construction, and will work with our Navy customer on any additional construction needs that could develop in light of increased submarine demand. Equal to the commitment of capital is our commitment to developing our Electric Boat workforce. While the steepest portion of our personnel ramp is behind us, we still expect the Electric Boat workforce to continue to grow to enable sustained production of one Columbia-class submarine plus up to two Virginia-class submarines per year as the submarine industrial base expands to support that pace. Along with strong contributions from the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island, we continue to invest in the training and tools necessary for our skilled employees to deliver these next-generation submarines to the Navy. We continue to work with our growing network of approximately 3,000 suppliers to support the growth related to concurrent production of the two submarine programs.\nBath Iron Works builds the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer and manages modernization and lifecycle support for all Navy destroyers.

Given our deep product innovation experience, we were recently selected to build the Next Generation Survival radio for the U.S. Joint Forces. For the Canadian Army, we provide the Land Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) system.\nMission Systems continues to help advance our nation’s position in the space domain. The U.S. Space Development Agency (SDA) selected Mission Systems to establish the ground operations and integration segment for Tranche 1 and 2 of the National Defense Space Architecture by building ground entry points and operations centers, as well as providing network operations and systems integration services for the SDA’s next tranche of proliferated low-Earth orbit satellites. In addition, we provide critical subsystems for data processing and security of space assets across multiple space vehicle platforms.\nIn the maritime domain, we have a more than 60-year legacy of providing critical systems to the Navy’s submarine programs. These include advanced fire-control and weapon launch systems, tactical control systems, specialized hardware and software solutions for acoustics, cybersecurity, and torpedo guidance, and other core capabilities that are essential for submarine modernization with U.S. and allied forces.\nMission Systems also continues to invest in autonomous capabilities both undersea and in the air. Our Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) Manufacturing and Assembly Center of Excellence provides manufacturing, assembly, integration and testing capabilities for Mission Systems’ Bluefin Robotics UUVs, as well as the Hammerhead and MEDUSA programs for the Navy. In addition, we support a variety of manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms with mission-critical processing and security subsystems on both modern combat and ISR aircraft as well as emerging capabilities like the Collaborative Combat Aircraft.\nRevenue for the Technologies segment was 27% of our consolidated revenue in 2024, 31% in 2023 and 32% in 2022. Revenue by major products and services was as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31                 2024   2023                    2022                 \nIT services                      $8,761                   $8,459                  $8,195   \nC5ISR solutions                   4,366                    4,463                   4,297   \nTotal Technologies              $13,127                  $12,922                 $12,492   \nCUSTOMERS\nIn 2024, 69% of our consolidated revenue was from the U.S. government, 14% was from U.S. commercial customers, 10% was from non-U.S. government customers and the remaining 7% was from non-U.S. commercial customers.\nU.S. GOVERNMENT\nOur primary customer is the DoD. We also contract with other U.S. government customers, including the intelligence community and the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. Our revenue from the U.S. government was as follows:\n\nYear Ended December 31                       2024                     2023                     2022\nDoD                                   $27,191                  $24,720                  $22,250    \nNon-DoD                                 4,810                    4,711                    4,808    \nForeign military sales (FMS)*           1,063                      896                      633    \nTotal U.S. government                 $33,064                  $30,327                  $27,691    \n% of total revenue                         69   %                   72   %                   70   %\n*In addition to our direct non-U.S. sales, we sell to non-U.S. governments through the FMS program. Under the FMS program, we contract with and are paid by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government assumes the risk of collection from the non-U.S. government customer.\nOur U.S. government revenue is derived from fixed-price, cost-reimbursement and time-and-materials contracts. Our production contracts are primarily fixed-price. Under these contracts, we agree to perform a specific scope of work for a fixed amount. Contracts for research, engineering, repair and maintenance, and other services are typically cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer reimburses contract costs incurred and pays a fixed, incentive or award-based fee. The amount for an incentive or award fee is determined by our ability to achieve targets set in the contract, such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. Under time-and-materials contracts, the customer pays a fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses us for the cost of materials.\nOf our U.S. government revenue, fixed-price contracts accounted for 51% in 2024, 53% in 2023 and 56% in 2022; cost-reimbursement contracts accounted for 43% in 2024, 41% in 2023 and 38% in 2022; and time-and-materials contracts accounted for 6% in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nFor information on the advantages and disadvantages of each of these contract types, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nU.S. COMMERCIAL\nOur U.S. commercial revenue was $6.7 billion in 2024, $5.8 billion in 2023 and $5.7 billion in 2022, which represented 14%, 14% and 15% of our consolidated revenue in each of the respective years. The majority of this revenue was for business jet aircraft and related services where our customer base consists of individuals and public and privately held companies across a wide range of industries. \nNON-U.S.\nOur revenue from non-U.S. government and commercial customers was $8 billion in 2024, $6.1 billion in 2023 and $6 billion in 2022, which represented 17% of our consolidated revenue in 2024, 14% in 2023 and 15% in 2022.\nWe conduct business with customers around the world. Our non-U.S. defense subsidiaries maintain long-term relationships with their customers and have established themselves as principal regional suppliers and employers, providing a broad portfolio of products and services.\nOur non-U.S. commercial revenue consists primarily of business jet aircraft exports and worldwide aircraft services. While the installed base of aircraft is concentrated in North America, orders from \ncustomers outside North America represent a significant portion of our aircraft business with approximately 43% of the Aerospace segment’s aircraft backlog on December 31, 2024.\nCOMPETITION\nSeveral factors determine our ability to compete successfully in the defense and business aviation markets. While customers’ evaluation criteria vary, the principal competitive elements include:\n•the technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services;\n•our ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats;\n•successful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems;\n•our global footprint and accessibility to customers;\n•the reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; and\n•the successful management of customer relationships.\nDEFENSE MARKET COMPETITION\nThe U.S. government contracts with numerous domestic and non-U.S. companies for products and services. We compete against other contractors as well as smaller companies that specialize in a particular technology or capability. Outside the United States, we compete with global defense contractors’ exports and the offerings of local, private and state-owned defense manufacturers. Our Marine Systems segment has one primary competitor with which it also partners on the Virginia-class submarine program, and to which it subcontracts on the Columbia-class submarine program. For commercial and repair work, the Marine Systems segment competes with several additional U.S. shipyards. Our Combat Systems segment competes with a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. businesses. Our Technologies segment competes with many companies, from large government contracting and commercial technology companies to small niche competitors with specialized technologies or expertise. The operating cycle of many of our major programs can result in sustained periods of program continuity when we perform successfully.\nWe are involved in teaming and subcontracting relationships with some of our competitors. Competitions for major defense and other government contracting programs often require companies to form teams to bring together a spectrum of capabilities to meet the customer’s requirements. Opportunities associated with these programs include roles as the program’s integrator, overseeing and coordinating the efforts of all participants on a team, or as a provider of a specific component or subsystem.\nBUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT MARKET COMPETITION\nThe Aerospace segment has several competitors for each of its Gulfstream products. Key competitive factors include aircraft safety, reliability and performance; comfort and in-flight productivity; service quality, global footprint and responsiveness; technological and new-product innovation; and price. We believe that Gulfstream competes effectively in all of these areas.\nThe Aerospace segment competes worldwide in the business jet aircraft services market primarily on the basis of quality, price and timeliness. While competition for each type of service varies somewhat, the segment faces a number of competitors of varying sizes for each of its offerings. \nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe develop technology, manufacturing processes and systems-integration practices. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to and from others. The U.S. government holds licenses to many of our patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents. Although these intellectual property rights are important to the operation of our business, no existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nOur company is a global community of approximately 117,000 employees dedicated to our Ethos of transparency, trust, honesty and alignment. These four core values drive how we operate our business; govern how we interact with each other, our customers, partners and suppliers; guide the way that we treat our workforce; and determine how we connect with our communities. Our commitment to ethical business practices is outlined in our Standards of Business Ethics and Conduct, which states our expectation that all employees conduct business in accordance with our Ethos, applicable laws and our policies. Each employee is asked to acknowledge receipt, understanding of and compliance with our standards.\nDue to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and train skilled and qualified people to design and build the products and perform the services required by our customers. This includes upskilling employees to advance within the workplace. The health, welfare and safety of our employees is paramount throughout our workplaces. This effort starts with treating all employees with dignity and respect and providing them with fair, market-based, competitive and equitable compensation. We recognize and reward the performance of our employees in line with our pay-for-performance philosophy and provide a comprehensive suite of benefit options that aim to enable our employees and their dependents to live healthy and productive lives.\nAcross our businesses, we take measures to prevent workplace hazards, encourage healthy and safe behaviors and enforce a culture of continuous improvement to ensure that our processes help reduce safety incidents and illnesses and comply with applicable health and safety laws.\nWe recognize that our success as a company depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified people. Our commitment to promoting diversity of thought, experience, perspectives, backgrounds and capabilities to drive innovation strengthens the solutions we deliver to our customers. General Dynamics works hard to promote an environment that values and supports all employees. We proudly support a work environment that respects diverse opinions, values individual skills, celebrates unique experiences and cultivates teamwork. These efforts are a demonstration of our dedication to equal employment opportunities that foster and support a principled, productive and inclusive work environment. We stand for basic universal human rights, including that employment must be voluntary. We track, measure and analyze our workforce trends to establish accountability for putting people first across our businesses and at every level of our company.\nOur values motivate us to promote strong workplace practices with opportunities for development and training. Our training and development efforts focus on ensuring that our people are appropriately trained on critical job skills as well as on leadership behaviors that are consistent with our Ethos. We conduct rigorous succession planning exercises to ensure that key positions have the appropriate level of \nbench strength to provide for future key positions and leadership transitions. We listen to our people to assess areas of concern and levels of engagement.\n2024 WORKFORCE STATISTICS\n•Approximately 84% of our employees are based in the United States, of which roughly 69% are white, 31% are people of color, 19% are veterans of the U.S. armed forces and 8% have self-reported having a disability. The remaining 16% of our workforce is based internationally in over 65 countries with the primary concentrations being in North America and Europe. Approximately 21% of our workforce is represented by collective bargaining agreements.\n•Our global workforce is 76% male and 24% female, and our senior leadership teams across the business are represented by 75% males and 25% females. During 2024, we hired more than 23,800 individuals of which 74% were male and 26% were female. For our approximately 19,400 U.S.-based hires in 2024, 58% were white and 42% were people of color.\nRAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS\nWe depend on suppliers and subcontractors for raw materials, components and subsystems. Our U.S. government customer is a supplier for some of our programs. These supply networks can experience price fluctuations and capacity constraints, which can put pressure on our costs. Effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance. If our sources of supply are disrupted, particularly in instances where we rely on only one or two sources of supply, or in the event that international conflicts result in the disruption of manufacturing or trade relations for some supply components, our ability to meet our customer commitments could be adversely impacted. We attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into long-term agreements and leveraging company-wide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nU.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS\nU.S. government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) govern the majority of our contracts. The FAR mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. government acquisitions and purchased services. Also, individual agencies can have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR. For example, the DoD implements the FAR through the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). For all federal government entities, the FAR regulates the phases of any product or service acquisition, including:\n•acquisition planning;\n•competition requirements;\n•contractor qualifications;\n•protection of source selection and supplier information; and\n•acquisition procedures.\nIn addition, the FAR addresses the allowability of our costs, while the CAS addresses the allocation of those costs to contracts. The FAR and CAS subject us to audits and other government reviews \ncovering issues such as cost, performance, internal controls and accounting practices relating to our contracts.\nNON-U.S. REGULATORY\nOur non-U.S. operations are subject to the applicable government regulations and procurement policies and practices, as well as U.S. policies and regulations. We are also subject to regulations governing investments, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings and import-export control.\nBUSINESS JET AIRCRAFT\nThe Aerospace segment is subject to FAA regulation in the United States and other similar aviation regulatory authorities internationally, including the Civil Aviation Administration of Israel (CAAI), the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness. Aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority, which is often accomplished through a supplemental type certificate. Aviation authorities can require changes to a specific aircraft or model type before granting approval. Maintenance facilities and charter operations must be licensed by aviation authorities as well.\nENVIRONMENTAL\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal, investigation and remediation of materials, substances and wastes identified in the laws and regulations. We are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigations or remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party sites that we do not own but where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP) by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or a state environmental agency. As a PRP, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the cost of remediating contamination. In cases where we have been designated a PRP, we generally seek to mitigate these environmental liabilities through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate cost-recovery actions. In the unlikely event that we are required to fully fund the remediation of a site, the current statutory framework would allow us to pursue contributions from other PRPs. We regularly assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters.\nOperating and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of contaminated sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. Historically, these costs have not been material. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, the timing and effect of which are difficult to assess.\nChanges in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs or facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs. Environmental costs are often recoverable under our contracts with the U.S. government. Based on information currently available and current U.S. government policies relating to cost recovery, we do not expect continued compliance with environmental regulations, including costs associated with changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional information relating to the impact of environmental matters, see Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe file reports and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). These reports and information include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and proxy statements. Free copies of these items, and any amendments to those items filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are made available on our website (gd.com) as soon as practicable after we electronically file such items with, or furnish them to, the SEC. The SEC maintains a website (sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information.\nIn addition to the information contained in this Form 10-K, information about the company can be found on our website and our Investor Relations website (investorrelations.gd.com). Our Investor Relations website contains a significant amount of information about the company, including financial information, our corporate governance principles and practices, and other information for investors. We encourage investors to visit our website, as we frequently update and post new information about our company, and it is possible that this information could be deemed material information.\nReferences to our website and the SEC’s website in this Form 10-K do not constitute, and should not be viewed as, incorporation by reference of the information contained on, or available through, the websites. The information should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K, unless otherwise expressly incorporated by reference.",

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. Investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our securities.\nInvestment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. The market risks faced by an investor in our securities are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. There are some risks that apply more specifically to our business.\nOur revenue is concentrated with the U.S. government. This customer relationship involves some specific risks. In addition, our sales to non-U.S. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. Despite the varying nature of our government and commercial operations and the markets they serve, each segment shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe U.S. government provides a significant portion of our revenue. Approximately 70% of our consolidated revenue was from the U.S. government. Levels of U.S. defense spending may be impacted by numerous factors, such as the domestic political environment, changes in national and international priorities, and threats to national security. Competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending. Decreases in U.S. government defense and other spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance.\nFor additional information relating to U.S. government budget and funding matters, see the Business Environment section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.\nU.S. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay. Our U.S. government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an October-to-September fiscal year. Early each calendar year, the President of the United States presents to the Congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. This budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is typically the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. For the remainder of the year, the Appropriations and Authorization Committees of the Congress typically review the president’s budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. Once these levels are enacted into law, the Executive Office of the President administers the funds to the agencies.\nThere are two primary risks associated with the U.S. government budget cycle. First, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted. If the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the U.S. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels, which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards. Second, the Congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. Future revenue under existing multi-year contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. Changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. Delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content.\nGovernment contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. If a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. The government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. If a contract is terminated for default, the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted. Many foreign contracts have similar termination rights by customers. The termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings.\nGovernment contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the U.S. government. Numerous U.S. government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. government also reviews the adequacy of, and compliance with, internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, material, earned value management and accounting systems. In some cases, audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. If an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities, civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made. In some cases, audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements, arbitration or litigation. Moreover, new laws, regulations or standards, or changes to existing ones, can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our revenue and earnings.\nOur Aerospace segment is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. The business jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by corporate, individual and government customers in the United States and around the world. Customer demand can be affected by a number of factors, including changes in general economic conditions, the availability and cost of credit, pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets. An adverse change in customer demand for our business-aviation products and services could materially affect our future revenue and earnings. In addition, if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced, the segment’s anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially.\nEarnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts. When agreeing to contractual terms, our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events. The accounting for our contracts requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events. These projections and estimates assess, among other things:\n•the productivity and availability of labor;\n•the complexity of the work to be performed;\n•the cost and availability of materials and components; and\n•schedule requirements.\nIf there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances, estimates or assumptions, or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately, the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected. This could affect earnings and margin materially.\nRevenue, earnings and margin depend in part on supplier performance. We rely on other companies and our government customers to provide materials, components and subsystems for our products. Suppliers, including subcontractors, sometimes perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. We depend on these suppliers and government entities to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law. Misconduct by suppliers, such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities, may harm our future revenue, earnings and margin. \nWe sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply, and any disruption in our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, some of our operating segments rely on the supply of semiconductors for the manufacture of our products, and any inability of or delay by our suppliers to meet our order demands (including due to the suppliers’ competing commercial priorities, any military conflict resulting in a disruption of manufacturing or trade relations, or any other business disruption) could delay or disrupt our ability to procure semiconductors. Our ability to perform our obligations to our customers, and our future revenue, earnings and margin, may be materially adversely affected if (1) any one or more of our suppliers is unable to or otherwise fails to, provide the agreed-upon materials or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or engages in misconduct or other improper activities or (2) we are unable to otherwise obtain necessary materials, components, subsystems or services in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. Many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system-integration processes. Our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at \ncost-effective prices. Many of our new products must meet extensive and time-consuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control and may result in unanticipated delays. Additionally, due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers and to develop and manufacture our products. To the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees. If we were unable to develop new products that meet customers’ changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our International Operations\nOperations outside the United States are subject to various risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries. In some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political instability, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. Our non-U.S. operations may be sensitive to and impacted by (1) changes in a foreign government’s national policies and priorities, political leadership and budgets, which may be influenced by changes in threat environments, geopolitical uncertainties, volatility in economic conditions and other economic and political factors including inflationary pressures; (2) changes in U.S., foreign, and international laws, regulations, and policies; (3) energy, natural resource and other commodity shortages; and (4) global trade disputes and supply chain disruptions. For example, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has resulted in the imposition of numerous economic and trade sanctions, export controls, and other restrictions targeting Russia and Belarus, and the Russian government has implemented counter-sanctions and export controls targeting the U.S. and various foreign countries in which we operate. These actions have caused some economic disruptions around the world and have exacerbated global supply chain challenges. Changes and developments in any of these matters or factors may occur suddenly and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments. \nNon-U.S. transactions can involve increased risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability, which could, among other things, negatively impact sales and the translation of our international revenue from local currencies into U.S. dollars, and differing legal systems. Our non-U.S. operations are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption laws, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). An unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with U.S. or foreign laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings.\nIn addition, some non-U.S. government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements. We may also be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy investment or other commitments or face penalties. Offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these commitments. If we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Acquisitions and Similar Investment Activities\nWe have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. When evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved; the performance of the underlying products, capabilities, or technologies; market conditions following the acquisition; and acquired liabilities, including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition. These factors could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business. We review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting units or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50%. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. We face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including the risk factors discussed in this section. We may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets. Future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOther Business and Operational Risks\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity events and other disruptions. We face various cybersecurity threats, including threats to our IT infrastructure and attempts to gain unauthorized access to our proprietary or classified information, denial-of-service attacks, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts. We also design and manage IT systems and products for various customers. We generally face the same security threats for these systems and products as for our own internal systems. In addition, we face cybersecurity threats from entities and persons that may seek to target us through our customers, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business. Many of these cybersecurity threats are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. Accordingly, we maintain information security staff, policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems, and we review and update our policies, procedures and practices in light of evolving threats. We conduct employee training on cybersecurity to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats, and we report cybersecurity events or losses of customer data to affected customers and applicable regulatory authorities. However, there can be no assurance that any such actions, including the timeliness of our efforts to review, update or implement policies, procedures and practices in light of evolving threats, or the safeguards put in place by our customers, suppliers and other parties on which we rely, will be sufficient to detect, prevent and mitigate cybersecurity breaches or disruptions, or the unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data.\nWe have experienced cybersecurity events and disruptions such as viruses and attacks targeting our IT systems. Such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, future threats could have a materially adverse impact on our company by, among other things, causing harm to our business, financial condition, results of operations or \nreputation; disrupting our operations; exposing us to potential liability, regulatory actions and loss of business; and challenging our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.\nOur business may continue to be negatively impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and could be negatively impacted by other pandemics and outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Other outbreaks of contagious diseases, including new variants of COVID-19, or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate or our customers are located, could similarly adversely affect our business. This includes disruptions or restrictions on our employees’ ability to work effectively, temporary closures of our facilities and the facilities of our customers, and the imposition of quarantine and travel restrictions that have and may in the future negatively affect demand for our products and services and result in supply-chain disruptions. Any such effects could materially adversely affect our ability to perform on our contracts. Any cost increases that result from these effects may not be fully recoverable on our contracts or adequately covered by insurance.\nGlobal climate change could negatively affect our business. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in state, federal or international requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming, such as the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms, stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, or other business restrictions or compliance requirements regarding reducing or mitigating global climate change. If environmental or climate-change laws or regulations are adopted or changed that directly or indirectly impose significant new costs, operational restrictions or compliance requirements on our business, products, customers or suppliers, they could increase our costs, require additional capital expenditures, reduce our margins and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, while we continuously evaluate and seek opportunities to improve our climate-related measures, there can be no assurance that changes in customer demand patterns and competition, as well as potential reputational risks, related to climate change will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis annual report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions.
