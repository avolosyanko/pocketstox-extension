      "text": "Item 1.   Business\nOverview\nUlta Beauty is the largest specialty beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care products, hair care products, and salon services. Key aspects of our business include:\nOne-of-a-kind Assortment. We offer guests a differentiated assortment of approximately 29,000 products from approximately 600 established and emerging beauty brands across a variety of categories and price points. We offer a wide selection of beauty and wellness categories, from mass to prestige price points, across cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products, professional hair products, and salon styling tools.\nStore Footprint. We operate more than 1,400 stores predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations. With a bright and open store environment, we make it easy for guests to discover new products and services. Our store design, fixtures, and open layout provide the flexibility to respond to consumer trends and changes in our merchandising strategy. We also offer beauty services in nearly every store, including a full-service hair salon and a BenefitTM Brow Bar. In addition to our free-standing locations, through our partnership with Target Corporation we have more than 600 Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shops which provide guests with a highly-curated, prestige beauty assortment in a unique and elevated presentation in 1,000 square feet of dedicated space within certain Target locations.\nLeading Digital Experiences. Through our website, Ulta.com, and our mobile applications, we offer guests convenient, immersive, and personalized digital experiences. Our digital channels enable always-on shopping and discovery, and our diverse fulfillment options, including buy online pick-up in store, buy online pick-up curbside, ship from store, ship from distribution center, and same-day delivery, provide guests with value and convenience. In addition to e-commerce platforms, we offer guests a variety of unique digital experiences, including virtual try-on and skin analysis tools, which leverage augmented reality capabilities and artificial intelligence tools to provide guests with personalized experiences. \nBest-in-Class Loyalty Program. Our best-in-class loyalty program, Ulta Beauty Rewards, enables members to earn points for every dollar spent on products and beauty services at Ulta Beauty, through purchases on our private label and co-branded credit cards, and purchases at Ulta Beauty at Target. In addition to unique membership benefits, members can redeem points for discounts on any product or service at Ulta Beauty. With more than 95% of total sales coming from members, we are uniquely positioned with a deep understanding of our customers and their preferences, enabling us to personalize experiences, recommendations, and promotions through our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform and support our brand partners’ growth. \nGreat Guest Experiences. We cultivate human connection with warm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our channels. Our knowledgeable and approachable store associates, our differentiated service offerings, and our efforts to create relevant, compelling digital content are competitive advantages and enable us to build strong engagement with guests.\n\nWe were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass, and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products; drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products; and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, select beauty services, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. We define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category, uses beauty for self-expression, experimentation, and self-investment, and has high expectations for the shopping experience. We estimate there are approximately 140 million beauty enthusiasts in the U.S.\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nThe following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 and our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur strategy\nWe target beauty enthusiasts across multiple demographics and shopping behaviors. Beauty enthusiasts have a deep emotional connection with beauty, and historically, this connection has not diminished in softer economic environments. Our proprietary consumer research confirms engagement with the beauty category remains strong. Strong engagement paired with increasing use of social media and the convergence of beauty and wellness has invited even more consumers into the beauty category and expanded the addressable market. At the same time, the beauty landscape is evolving and guest expectations are rising, which will require continued innovation and investment to further our leadership position. \nReflecting our understanding about how the consumer and beauty category are evolving, in 2024 we refreshed our strategic framework. Through a focus on four foundational areas, our strategies are designed to position Ulta Beauty as the destination for beauty enthusiasts for a lifetime, drive market share leadership in beauty and wellness, and deliver long-term profitable growth. \nAssortment: Curating the best of all things beauty and wellness for all beauty enthusiasts. Beauty enthusiasts enjoy the experience of discovering and trying new products and consider beauty very much part of their self-care and wellness journey. Reflecting these insights, our objective is to engage and continuously delight beauty enthusiasts with a curated, differentiated beauty and wellness assortment. We intend to drive product newness through a differentiated portfolio of exclusive, emerging and established brands, including Ulta Beauty Collection, and accelerate our leadership position in wellness with an expanded assortment and elevated experience.\nExperience: Fostering authentic, empowering human connections that inspire, delight and engage guests at every touchpoint. The guest experience is central to driving guest love and loyalty. Our consumer research suggests there are several important experience elements that are most critical to the beauty enthusiast including: creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, providing trusted guidance, offering convenience and ease, and delivering fun and immersion. To deliver on these critical needs and foster authentic, empowering human connections that inspire, delight and engage guests at every touchpoint, we intend to enhance the in-store experience by investing in our best-in-class store associates and stylists, distinct service offerings, and signature events and heighten omnichannel satisfaction, meeting every guest where they are with a robust suite of offerings and increased convenience.\nLoyalty: Building lifelong loyalty and brand love through member growth and personalization. To understand longer-term shifts in consumer values, perceptions, and behaviors, as well as of-the-moment insights, we have developed a robust consumer research capability. In addition, with more than 95% of total sales coming from our 44.6 million active Ulta Beauty Rewards loyalty program members, we have unique insights about customer preferences and behavior. Based on our proprietary insights, we know beauty enthusiasts have an emotional, personal, and deep connection with beauty. Social media contributes to this connection, and we expect the influence and reach of beauty will continue to grow as engagement with social platforms increases. To build lifelong loyalty and brand love, we intend to deepen guest engagement through community building and advanced personalization with the goal of expanding our loyalty program from approximately 44 million to 50 million members by 2028 by reaching new segments of beauty enthusiasts.\nAccess: Engaging our guests wherever they want to shop by expanding our reach through seamless and immersive omnichannel experiences.  Beauty enthusiasts continue to demonstrate their commitment to and preference for the in-person shopping experience, while also embracing the use of online shopping to supplement discovery and convenience. We have built a powerful omnichannel ecosystem that enables guests to shop in ways most convenient to them, whether in stores, on our app or website, or through our partnership with Ulta Beauty at Target. In addition, we have increased our fulfillment options, providing guests with choice, convenience, and speed. To achieve our objective of engaging our guests by expanding our reach, we intend to accelerate new store openings, targeting more than 1,800 stores over the long term; elevate digital engagement by fueling discovery through continued innovation and streamlining the shopping experience; and grow beyond our traditional channels through our partnership with Target Corporation and through international expansion in Mexico and the Middle East.\n5\n\n\n\nCulture and Talent: Underpinning our strategy with exceptional people, culture, and execution. We have developed and nurtured a guest and associate-centric, values-based, and high-performance culture. We are focused on reenergizing the core tenets of our culture on how we lead with a winning mindset and how we live our values to care for our guests and for each other. We have talented associates and leaders, and we value and encourage collaboration and enterprise thinking. To support our growth and enhance the guest experience, we will continue to attract, develop and retain talent at all levels and in all functional areas, and we will continue to work to create an environment that positions our associates to fully contribute and have opportunities for growth. We have achieved our success through strong operational execution. \n\nOur market\nWe operate within the large and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry. In 2024, this market represented approximately $186 billion in sales, according to forecasted Euromonitor International and IBIS World Inc. In 2024, the beauty products industry totaled approximately $118 billion and included cosmetics, haircare, fragrance, bath and body, skincare, salon styling tools, and other toiletries. We estimate that Ulta Beauty had only a 9% share of the $118 billion beauty product industry. Within this market, we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige, mass, and salon products. In 2024, the salon services industry totaled approximately $68 billion and included hair, skin, and nail services. We estimate that Ulta Beauty had less than 1% share of this industry. We have full-service hair salons in substantially every store and operate brow bars in most of our stores, as well as makeup and ear piercing services through our salons. In addition, we offer skin services in approximately 150 locations.\nCompetition\nOur major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores, specialty stores, grocery stores, drug stores, mass merchandisers, and the online capabilities of national retailers and brands, as well as pure-play e-commerce companies and online marketplaces. The market for salon services and products is highly fragmented. Our competitors for salon services and products include chain and independent salons.\nOur retail channels\nWe are committed to meeting guests where and how they want to shop and strive to offer guests a compelling, personalized shopping experience through our stores, digital platforms, and partnerships.\nStores\nOur member data and customer research suggests our guests prefer to transact in physical stores, where they can discover and interact with products and other beauty enthusiasts. In our fiscal year ended February 1, 2025 (fiscal 2024), 75% of our loyalty members transacted with us solely in one of our stores. Our retail stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power strip centers. Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. We also have a smaller footprint store prototype ranging between approximately 5,000 and 7,500 square feet which provides increased flexibility to enter smaller markets or shopping centers.\nWe offer a full range of beauty services in our stores, focusing on hair, makeup, brow, and skin services. The vast majority of our stores include an open and modern salon area, with most of our stores offering brow services on the salon floor. In addition, stores offering skin services include a skin treatment room or dedicated skin treatment area on the sales floor. The salon features a concierge desk, approximately five to ten stations, and a shampoo and hair color processing area. We employ highly skilled, licensed professional stylists and estheticians who offer services as well as educational experiences, including consultations, styling lessons, makeup applications, skincare services, and at-home care recommendations. \n\n\n6\n\n\n\nIn addition to opening new stores, we also remodeled and relocated certain stores, as shown in the following table:\n​\n\n               ​                   ​        ​         ​         ​         ​         ​     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​                                  ​                                     Fiscal year ended\n​                                      February 1,         February 3,         January 28,\n​                                  ​          2025   ​            2024   ​            2023\nTotal stores beginning of period   ​         1,385   ​           1,355   ​           1,308\nStores opened                      ​            66   ​              33   ​              47\nStores closed                      ​           (6)   ​             (3)   ​               –\nTotal stores end of period         ​         1,445   ​           1,385   ​           1,355\n​                                  ​             ​   ​               ​   ​               ​\nTotal square footage               ​    15,110,170   ​      14,515,593   ​      14,200,403\nAverage square footage per store   ​        10,457   ​          10,481   ​          10,480\n​                                  ​             ​   ​               ​   ​               ​\nStores remodeled                   ​            41   ​              18   ​              20\nStores relocated                   ​             2   ​               7   ​              12\n​\nOur real estate vision is to make Ulta Beauty accessible and convenient to more consumers across a variety of markets and is a key driver of how we plan to expand our market share over time. We believe that over the long term, we have the potential to grow our store footprint to more than 1,800 freestanding Ulta Beauty stores in the United States. \nWe leverage a variety of insights to identify the best new store locations and optimize our current store locations, including beauty market share information and insights from our loyalty members. This insight-led, analytical approach to site selection has resulted in a high performing real estate portfolio. The average investment required to open a new Ulta Beauty store is approximately $2.1 million, which includes capital investments, net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory, net of payables. Our net investment required to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors, including geographic location and store size. \nOur traditional layout is organized by price point, with prestige makeup and skincare on one side of the store and mass makeup and skincare on the other. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance and evolve our in-store experience to engage our guests, we also have a layout in select stores that brings together like categories with intuitive adjacencies to magnify our differentiated assortment. This additional layout features elevated gondolas to showcase key, iconic, and service brands and Beauty Bars that offer our brow and makeup services, support in-store events, and highlight beauty-in-action. In addition, select store layouts may vary due to square footage or location. \n​\nDigital platform\nIn addition to store expansion, we continue to expand our digital capabilities as more of our guests choose to engage with us across physical and digital platforms. In fiscal 2024, 18% of our loyalty members shopped both in Ulta Beauty stores and through our digital platforms. Our omnichannel guests are extremely valuable, historically spending nearly three times as much as retail-only guests.\nOur e-commerce platform has two key roles: generating direct channel sales and profits by engaging our guests in an interactive, enjoyable way that reinforces the Ulta Beauty brand; and driving traffic to our stores, website, and native applications. As part of our digital store transformation, we recently completed a large-scale upgrade of our digital and e-commerce infrastructure to enable us to deliver immersive commerce experiences and position our e-commerce business for growth and scalability. We continue to develop and add new website and mobile features and functionality, marketing programs, new products and brands, and omnichannel integration points. In 2024, we launched Ulta Beauty Community, an online destination where beauty enthusiasts can connect and engage with one another over their shared joy for all things beauty. We continue to grow our digital business by providing our guests with a unique, rich online experience, with personalized recommendations, expanded assortments, engaging experiences, including virtual try-on and analysis capabilities, and social media content. \nWe continue to improve our order fulfillment capabilities with increased speed of delivery through existing distribution centers, fast fulfillment center (e-commerce only), market fulfillment centers, and select retail stores, through more \n\n\n7\n\n\n\nefficient processes designed for e-commerce order fulfillment. In addition to ship to home order fulfillment, we offer guests “Buy Online, Pick-up in Store,” “Curbside Pickup,” and “Store 2 Door,” which provides the ability for customers to order in-store and have products delivered to their homes. In addition, we offer same-day delivery for e-commerce orders in virtually all markets. \nPartnerships\nTo expand loyalty member engagement and introduce new guests to Ulta Beauty, we have a partnership with Target Corporation to create Ulta Beauty at Target, a “shop-in-shop” concept that offers a curated assortment of more than 60 established and emerging prestige brands across a variety of categories. Co-designed by Ulta Beauty and Target, the Ulta Beauty at Target shop is intended to reflect the Ulta Beauty experience with a unique and elevated presentation in 1,000 square feet of dedicated space separate but adjacent to Target’s core beauty department. The shop is staffed by Target team members who are trained by Ulta Beauty to provide recommendations and answer product questions. Members in our loyalty program, Ulta Beauty Rewards, can earn points for purchases made in the Ulta Beauty at Target shop. Loyalty points can only be redeemed in Ulta Beauty stores, on Ulta.com or through our mobile applications. As of February 1, 2025, Ulta Beauty at Target was available in over 600 Target locations and on target.com. Over time, we believe Ulta Beauty at Target could be in up to 800 Target locations, in addition to our freestanding Ulta Beauty stores.\nWe are committed to growing our business outside of the U.S. through international expansion in Mexico and the Middle East. In Mexico, we have a joint venture partnership with Grupo Axo, an experienced operator of global brands to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico beginning in 2025. In the Middle East, we entered into a franchise partnership with Alshaya Group, a leading international franchise operator, whereby Alshaya will license the Ulta Beauty brand name and operating model in the Middle East.\nMerchandising \nOverview\nWe offer one of the most extensive product and brand selections in our industry, including a broad assortment of branded and private label beauty and wellness products in cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products, and salon styling tools. Across our stores, Ulta.com and our mobile applications, we offer approximately 29,000 products from approximately 600 well-established and emerging beauty and wellness brands across all categories and price points, including Ulta Beauty’s own private label, Ulta Beauty Collection. Our merchandising team continually monitors beauty and wellness trends, sales trends, and new product launches to keep Ulta Beauty’s product assortment fresh and relevant and to ensure that our assortment reflects the diversity of our guests. We believe our broad selection of merchandise, from moderately-priced brands to higher-end luxury brands, creates a unique shopping experience for our guests.\n\nIn addition to our partners’ brands, we believe our recently relaunched private label brand, Ulta Beauty Collection, is a strategically important opportunity for growth and profit contribution. Our objective is to provide quality, trend-right private label products to continue to strengthen our guests’ perception of Ulta Beauty, and serve as an important pillar of the Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty® program. Ulta Beauty manages the full development cycle of these products from concept through production to deliver differentiated packaging and formulas that enhance our brand image. Ulta Beauty Collection has been certified in the Clean Ingredients and Cruelty Free pillars within the Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty® program. We also offer products such as Tarte Double Duty Beauty cosmetics and IT Brushes for Ulta that are permanently exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Similarly, we offer a number of brands and products that are exclusive for a limited period of time or are offered in advance of our competitors, such as Morphe, Peach & Lily, and R.E.M Beauty. Ulta Beauty Collection and permanent Ulta Beauty exclusive products represented approximately 4% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. Both permanent and temporary exclusive products represented approximately 9% of our net sales in fiscal 2024.\nCategories\nWe offer a balanced portfolio across six primary categories: (1) cosmetics; (2) skincare; (3) haircare; (4) fragrance; (5) services; and (6) other, which includes other revenue sources such as the private label and co-branded credit card \n\n\n8\n\n\n\nprograms, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage. \n\nThe following table sets forth the approximate percentage of net sales attributed to each category for the periods presented: \n​\n\n            ​               ​        ​         ​         ​         ​         ​     \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​                           ​                                     Fiscal year ended\n​                           ​   February 1,   ​     February 3,   ​     January 28,\n(Percentage of net sales)   ​          2025   ​            2024   ​            2023\nCosmetics                   ​           39%                 41%                 42%\nSkincare                    ​           23%   ​             22%   ​             20%\nHaircare                    ​           19%   ​             20%   ​             22%\nFragrance                   ​           13%   ​             11%   ​             11%\nServices                    ​            4%   ​              4%   ​              3%\nOther                       ​            2%   ​              2%   ​              2%\n​                           ​          100%   ​            100%   ​            100%\n​\nOrganization\n​\nOur merchandising team consists of a Chief Merchandising and Digital Officer who oversees the Senior Vice President of Cosmetics, Fragrance and Private Label and the Senior Vice President of Haircare, Skincare, Bodycare and Wellness, who in turn oversee category Vice Presidents who in turn oversee Divisional Merchandise Managers and their teams of buyers. Our Chief Merchandising and Digital Officer also oversees our e-commerce business and our centralized merchandise planning and forecasting group to ensure consistent execution across our omnichannel platforms and our planogram team. \nIn stores, we present products in an open-sell environment using centrally produced planograms (detailed schematics showing product placement in the store) and promotional merchandising planners. Our planogram team assists the merchants and inventory teams to keep new products flowing into stores on a timely basis. All major product categories undergo planogram revisions on a regular basis, and adjustments are made to assortment mix and product placement based on current sales trends. Our visual marketing team works with our merchandising team to develop strategic placement of promotional merchandise, functional and educational signage, and creative product presentation standards in all of our stores. All stores receive centrally produced promotional merchandising planners to ensure consistent implementation of our marketing programs.\nPlanning and allocation\nWe have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our merchandising strategy. We centrally manage product replenishment to our stores through our merchandise planning group. This group serves as a strategic partner to, and provides financial oversight of, the merchandising team. The merchandising team creates a sales forecast by category for the year. Our merchandise planning group creates an open-to-buy plan, approved by senior executives, for each product category. The open-to-buy plan is updated weekly with point-of-sale (POS) data, receipts, and inventory levels and is used throughout the year to balance buying opportunities and inventory return on investment. We believe this structure maximizes our buying opportunities while maintaining organizational and financial control. POS data is used to calculate sales forecasts and to determine replenishment levels. We determine promotional product replenishment levels using sales history from similar or comparable events. To ensure our inventory remains productive, our planning and replenishment group, along with senior executives, monitor the levels of clearance and aged inventory in our stores on a weekly basis. \nBrand partnerships\nWe have strong, active relationships with our brand partners. Our top ten brand partners, such as L’Oréal and Estée Lauder Companies, among others, represented 54% and 55% of our total net sales in fiscal 2024 and our fiscal year \n\n\n9\n\n\n\nended February 3, 2024 (fiscal 2023), respectively. We believe our brand partners view us as a significant distribution channel for growth and brand enhancement, and we work closely with them to market both new and existing brands.\nAll brand partners and respective subcontractors and their facilities are subject to the applicable Ulta Vendor Standards, which set forth the ethical, legal, social, and workplace standards to meet in order to do business with Ulta Beauty. In addition to complying with Ulta Vendor Standards, many brand partners have committed to help advance our mission to maintain the beauty of our environment and minimize our impact on the world around us by offering sustainable packaging. We have made a commitment that 50% of packaging from products sold at our stores will be recyclable, refillable, or made from recycled or bio-sourced materials by the end of fiscal 2025. \nMarketing and advertising\nWe employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness, drive traffic to our stores, website, and mobile applications, acquire new loyalty program members, improve guest retention, increase frequency of shopping, and increase spend per member. We communicate with our guests and prospective guests through multiple vehicles, including print advertising, digital and social media, television and radio. These vehicles highlight the breadth of our selection of prestige, mass and salon beauty products, new products and services, and special offers, as well as build an emotional connection with guests. Our comprehensive public relations strategy enhances Ulta Beauty’s reputation as a beauty destination, increases brand awareness, and drives awareness of new products, in-store events, and new store openings.\nThe Ulta Beauty Rewards loyalty program is an important tool to increase retention of existing guests and to enhance their loyalty to the Ulta Beauty brand. Our CRM platform enables sophisticated analysis of the customer data in our loyalty member database as well as greater personalization of our marketing campaigns, digital experiences, and day-to-day communications. Our data demonstrates that loyalty members spend more per visit as compared to non-members. Ulta Beauty Rewards enables customers to earn points based on their purchases at Ulta Beauty stores, through our digital platforms, and at Ulta Beauty at Target. Points earned are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell or service we provide in Ulta Beauty stores or through our digital platforms. To enhance our loyalty program, we offer co-branded and private label credit cards. The credit cards drive higher wallet share and greater loyalty from our rewards members, provide increased consumer insights, and offer attractive economics. \nWe are directing a growing percentage of our marketing expense towards digital, social media, and streaming advertising. We believe these channels are highly effective in communicating with existing guests, as well as driving consideration amongst those who have not yet shopped with us. In social media channels, influencers and affiliates play an important role in beauty, and we engage talent from our UB Collective, our affiliate program, and Ulta Beauties, our associate ambassador program to support our marketing efforts. Our digital marketing strategy includes search engine optimization, paid search, mobile advertising, social media, display advertising, and other digital marketing channels. Digital marketing, coupled with our national TV and radio advertising, has helped us increase brand awareness and consideration among those not familiar with Ulta Beauty, which we believe has resulted in new guests. \nRetail media network\nWe have a deep understanding of our Ulta Beauty Rewards loyalty members and their preferences. This unique understanding, combined with our ongoing investment in data analytics and CRM capabilities, enables us to create personalized experiences and value for our guests and has unlocked new ways for us to support our brand partners and drive additional vendor income. In 2022, we launched our retail media network, UB Media, to transform the way our brand partners can connect with beauty enthusiasts. UB Media offers brands a suite of media and advertising capabilities that aim to personalize guest engagement and drive the acquisition of new guests.\n​\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nStaffing and operations\nRetail stores\nOur current Ulta Beauty store format is typically staffed with a general manager, a services manager, and three associate managers, along with approximately 28 full- and part-time associates, including approximately four to eight prestige advisors and five to ten licensed salon professionals. The management team in each store reports to the General Manager. The General Manager oversees all store activities including salon management, inventory management, merchandising, cash management, scheduling, hiring, and guest services. Members of store management receive bonuses depending on their position and based upon various performance metrics. Each General Manager reports to a District Manager, who in turn reports to a Regional Vice President of Operations, who in turn reports to a Senior Vice President of Stores, who in turn reports to the Chief Retail Officer, who in turn reports to the Chief Executive Officer. Each store team receives additional support from time to time from recruiting specialists for the retail and salon operations, regionally based talent development managers, a field loss prevention team, service district educators and service district leaders, and brand partners.\nUlta Beauty stores are open seven days a week, typically eleven hours a day, Monday through Saturday, and seven hours on Sunday. Our stores have extended hours during the holiday season. \nSalon services\nA typical salon is staffed with five to ten licensed salon professionals, including six or more stylists, and select stores have an esthetician. Our most productive salons have a guest coordinator and an assistant manager. Our services district educators and brand partner education classes create a comprehensive educational program for approximately 7,500 Ulta Beauty salon professionals.\nSupply chain\nOur vision is to build and operate a dynamic and agile end-to-end supply chain that improves operational efficiency, performance, and guest experience to fuel organizational growth effectively. This includes enhanced systems and processes as well as a modernized distribution center network to support our new store and e-commerce growth. We operate four regional distribution centers and two market fulfillment centers that support both stores and e-commerce demand, and one fast fulfillment center that supports e-commerce orders only. Market fulfillment centers are smaller than our regional distribution centers and focus on our most productive products enabling us to improve service and responsiveness, especially in markets with high store and population density. In addition, approximately 500 stores fulfill e-commerce orders as part of our ship-from-store program.\nInventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution centers, market fulfillment centers and fast fulfillment center. We replenish our stores with such products primarily in eaches (i.e., less-than-case quantities), which allows us to ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a particular product is required. Our distribution centers, market fulfillment centers, and fast fulfillment center use warehouse management software systems to manage inventory to support product purchase decisions. Product is delivered to stores using a broad network of contract and local pool (final mile) carriers.\nHuman capital management\nWe believe our associates, with their combined skills, knowledge, experiences, and commitment to serving our guests, are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success. We strive to make Ulta Beauty a great place to work by leading with our hearts, caring for each other in everything we do, and demonstrating integrity, authenticity and inclusivity in our daily actions. ​\n\n\n11\n\n\n\nThe following table sets forth the approximate number of associates employed as of February 1, 2025: \n​\n\n       ​           ​   ​   ​   ​   ​     ​   \n---------------------------------------------\nFull-time          ​   ​   ​   ​   ​   20,000\nPart-time          ​   ​   ​   ​   ​   38,000\nTotal associates   ​   ​   ​   ​   ​   58,000\n​                  ​   ​   ​   ​   ​        ​\nWe have no collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe we have good relationships with our associates.\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion\nThe beauty industry is inherently diverse, and because of that, we embed inclusion efforts through a cross-functional approach, led by our Chief Executive Officer, to ensure teams remain energized and motivated to lead in this critical space. At Ulta Beauty, our mission is to make beauty accessible, inclusive, and empowering for everyone. Ulta Beauty believes that everyone deserves to feel good in their own skin. We believe that when you are free to be your full self, you feel like you belong. As a values-driven company, we believe we have a responsibility to drive inclusivity and a sense of belonging for our guests and associates. We accomplish this through evolving our assortment to ensure we offer relevant products to our diverse customer base, inclusive recruitment strategies, dedicating time to celebrate diversity and inclusion, and encouraging associates to build personal habits through everyday inclusive actions.\nIn addition, we aim to ensure that all in-store experiences are equitable, fair, and unbiased. We take action to support this goal by providing quarterly trainings for in-store associates and providing weekly learning opportunities to focus on guest perspectives and reinforce key takeaways. We offer similar training across the organization to help key decision-makers and associates in their own learning journeys and support our Champion Diversity value and inclusion competency. \nThe following table sets forth key metrics as of February 1, 2025:\n​\n\n       ​          ​       ​       ​       ​        ​       ​     \n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n​                 ​   Board of    ​   ​            ​   All Other \n​                 ​   Directors   ​   Leadership   ​   Associates\nWomen             ​   64%         ​   67%          ​   91%       \nMen               ​   36%         ​   33%          ​   9%        \nPeople of color   ​   36%         ​   28%          ​   57%       \n​Oversight and management\nWe strive to make sure that our associates are at the heart of every decision we make. The Chief Human Resources Officer, along with the entire executive team, is responsible for developing and executing the Company’s human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, acquisition, development, and engagement of talent and the design of associate compensation and benefits programs. Our human capital objectives and initiatives, including the risks related to compensation policies and practices, management development and leadership succession, inclusion practices, and implementation and compliance monitoring of our code of business conduct, are also overseen by individual Board committees as described in our corporate governance guidelines.\nWe believe open and honest two-way communication is critical to maintaining strong associate engagement. We regularly conduct an associate engagement survey to determine associates’ satisfaction with their roles, their leaders, and the Company as a whole, which our executive team reviews and monitors. Our leadership team also hosts roundtable sessions, as well as additional forums, including department town halls, store and distribution center visits, and other small group gatherings, to dive deeper on specific topics.\nTraining and development\nOur success is dependent, in part, on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified associates at all levels of the organization. We are committed to continually developing our associates and providing career advancement \n\n\n12\n\n\n\nopportunities. Our associates and management teams are essential to our store expansion strategy. We use a combination of existing managers, promoted associates, and outside hires to support our new stores. The majority of our promotions are internal. As we continue to promote and develop from within, we are building a bench of associates and leaders who understand our business well and support our values-driven culture.\nAll of our associates participate in an interactive new-hire orientation through which each associate becomes acquainted with Ulta Beauty’s mission, vision, and values. Through our learning management system and our digital workplace system, we provide continuing education to associates throughout their careers at Ulta Beauty. Additionally, our leadership development program prepares promising future leaders for new levels of responsibility.\nCompensation and benefits\nOur commitment to our associates and their well-being is one of our highest priorities. We have assembled a suite of benefits that affirms and supports all that our associates contribute every day, including:\n\n●   Health care coverage is offered to those who work more than 30 hours a week in any position. Coverage extends to eligible dependents, including spouses, domestic partners, and children under the age of 26. We offer comprehensive medical plans that empower associates to choose the coverage that best suits them;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   401(k) plan with up to a 4% company match;\n----------------------------------------------\n\n●   Disability and life insurance;\n----------------------------------\n\n●   Company-paid short-term disability pay at 80% of pay;\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Additional insurance options, including legal, pet, home, and auto;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Tuition reimbursement program;\n----------------------------------\n\n●   Paid time off, including an extended illness bank; and\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Discounts on retail products and salon services.\n----------------------------------------------------\nIn addition, we believe wellness, like beauty, is more than skin deep, so we offer mental health resources, such as counseling services and access to mobile applications, financial wellness planning and guidance, and health mobile applications and educational resources for soon-to-be parents.\nThe Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation supports the Associate Relief Program to assist associates facing unforeseen financial hardship. The Associate Relief Program provides short-term financial support to reimburse medical bills or support temporary housing. \nSustainability\nWe strive to operate in an environmentally responsible manner. Our retail stores are focused on energy reduction efforts by maintaining safe indoor air for all customers while products are being used in our salons, using adequate energy-efficient lighting, managing the in-store temperatures, and making efficient use of water needed for our salon services. In addition, we will continue to look for ways to reduce our carbon footprint by investments in renewable energy credits and working with our brand partners to identify ways to work together to reduce Scope 3 emissions. \n​\nInformation technology \nWe are committed to using technology to enhance our competitive position. We intend to leverage our technology infrastructure and systems to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems, people, and processes. In fiscal 2024, we completed several multi-year strategic investment projects to upgrade key elements of our technology infrastructure including upgrading our enterprise resource planning platform and refreshing our POS system in all stores, transitioning our digital store to a new architecture, and building a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decisioning capabilities. Collectively, we expect these investments to provide a flexible and scalable operating environment allowing for greater business efficiency and enhancing the guest experience. We will continue to make investments in our information systems to facilitate growth and enhance our competitive position. Also see “Cybersecurity” included as part of Item 1C. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n13\n\n\n\nIntellectual property\nWe have registered trademarks in the United States and other countries. The majority of our trademark registrations contain the ULTA mark, including Ulta Beauty® and two related designs, Ulta.com and Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance (and design). We maintain our marks and monitor filing deadlines for renewal and continued validity. All marks that are deemed material to our business have been applied for or registered in the United States and select foreign countries, including Canada, Mexico and other countries in Latin America, Europe, and Asia.\nWe believe our trademarks, especially those related to the Ulta Beauty brand, “All Things Beauty. All In One Place. ®”, “The Possibilities are Beautiful®”, “21 Days of Beauty®”, and “Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty®” have significant value and are important to building brand recognition.\nGovernment regulation\nWe are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions, and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations, and other constraints exist at the federal, state, or local levels in the United States. The products we sell, such as cosmetics (including products with cannabidiol), dietary supplements, food, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, medical devices, and styling tools, including our Ulta Beauty branded products, may be subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state regulatory agencies, and State Attorneys General (State AGs). Such regulations principally relate to the safety, labeling, manufacturing, advertising, and distribution of the products. In addition, the salon services provided in our stores may be subject to state and local regulations.\nCosmetics, OTC drugs, medical devices, and dietary supplements have specific regulatory requirements, including but not limited to ingredient, labeling, manufacturing, and holding requirements. Products such as wrinkle reducing lights may be classified as medical devices and, in addition to being subject to labeling and manufacturing requirements, may also be subject to premarketing review by the FDA. Finally, products such as styling tools (e.g., blow dryers and curling irons) are regulated by the CPSC, which has strict requirements including the requirement to report certain product defects. The labeling and packaging of all of these products may also be subject to the requirements of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and state specific requirements.\nFurther, statements we make in advertising, including statements about the safety or efficacy of products, pricing, and environmental claims, are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, which generally prohibit unfair or deceptive practices.\nFederal, state, municipal, and local labor and employment statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, mandates, and taxation laws, to which most retailers are typically subject, also impact our day-to-day operations. We are also subject to typical governmental and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws (both federal and state). Our services operations are subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements. \nIn our store leases, we require our landlords to obtain all necessary governmental approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site, and we also ask them to obtain any governmental approvals and permits for our specific use (but at times the responsibility for obtaining governmental approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us). As applicable, we require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located. If required by the municipality, we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or build-outs that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or build-outs.\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day.\n\n\n14\n\n\n\nAvailable information\nOur principal website address is www.ulta.com. We make available at this address under investor relations (at https://ulta.com/investor), free of charge, our proxy statement, annual report to shareholders, annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Information available on our website is not incorporated by reference in and is not deemed a part of this Form 10-K.

      "text": "Item 1A.   Risk Factors\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or future growth. We could also be affected by additional risks that apply to all companies operating in the United States, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment in our common stock.\nBusiness, Operational and Strategic Risks\nWe may not be able to sustain our growth plans and successfully implement our long-range strategic, operational and financial plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. \nOur continued and future growth largely depends on our ability to implement our long-range strategic, operational and financial plans and successfully open and operate new stores profitably. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth plans, long-range strategic imperatives and/or operational excellence priorities, including continuous improvement and supply chain optimization, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. \nIf we are unable to gauge beauty trends and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales may decrease.\nWe believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to:\n\n●   recognize and define product and beauty trends;\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n●   anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer preferences (including relating to sustainability of product sources and packaging, ingredient transparency, and animal welfare) in a timely manner;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   translate market trends into appropriate, saleable product and service offerings in our stores and salons in advance of our competitors;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   develop and maintain vendor relationships that provide us access to the newest merchandise on reasonable terms; and\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   distribute merchandise to our stores in an efficient and effective manner and maintain appropriate in-stock levels.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n15\n\n\n\nIf we are unable to anticipate and fulfill the merchandise needs of the consumer, our net sales may decrease and we may be forced to increase markdowns of slow-moving merchandise, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nAny significant interruption in the operations of our distribution, fast fulfillment, and market fulfillment centers could disrupt our ability to deliver merchandise to our stores and guests in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe distribute products to our stores without supplementing such deliveries with direct-to-store arrangements from vendors or wholesalers. We are a retailer carrying approximately 29,000 beauty products that change on a regular basis in response to beauty trends, which makes the success of our operations particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our distribution infrastructure. Any significant interruption in the operation of our supply chain infrastructure, such as disruptions in our information systems, disruptions in operations due to fire, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, inventory availability (including as a result of tariffs or trade barriers), or shipping and transportation problems, could drastically reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores and guests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. In addition, shipping and transportation costs represent a component of our cost structure and an increase in shipping and transportation costs, including as a result of inflationary pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n\nOur e-commerce platform exposes us to certain additional risks which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe offer most of our beauty products for sale through our Ulta.com website and through our mobile applications. As a result, we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internet-based businesses, including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a cost-effective basis and our ability to operate, support, expand, and develop our internet operations, website, mobile applications and software, and other related operational systems. Although we believe that our omnichannel participation is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers, supporting product offerings through these channels can create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations. For example, if our e-commerce platform successfully grows, it may do so in part by attracting existing guests, rather than new guests, who choose to purchase products from us online or through our mobile applications rather than from our physical stores, thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores. In addition, offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet or mobile customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products. Offering products through our internet channel or through our mobile applications could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet or mobile offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors. Additionally, omnichannel retailing continues to rapidly evolve, and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments by our competitors. As we continue to grow our e-commerce platform, the impact of attracting existing rather than new guests, conflicts between product offerings online or through our mobile applications and through our stores, and opening up our channels to increased competition from pure-play e-commerce companies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. In addition, if we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant guest-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIncreased costs or interruption in our third-party vendors’ overseas sourcing operations could disrupt production, shipment, or receipt of some of our merchandise, which could result in lost sales and could increase our costs.\nWe directly source the majority of our Ulta Beauty Collection components and Ulta Beauty branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products through third-party vendors using foreign factories. In addition, many of our vendors use overseas sourcing to varying degrees to manufacture some or all of their products. Any event causing a disruption of manufacturing or imports from such foreign countries, including the imposition of import restrictions, increased customs duties, tariffs, trade barriers (including quotas), geopolitical events, political changes, and legal or economic restrictions on overseas suppliers’ ability to produce and deliver products, could result in substantial disruptions in our supply chain (including inventory availability) and materially harm our operations. We have no long-term supply contracts with \n\n\n16\n\n\n\nrespect to such foreign-sourced items, many of which are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs, or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the United States from such countries. Our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with sourcing goods from abroad, such as political instability, disruption of imports by labor disputes, and local business practices. Our sourcing operations may also be hurt by health concerns regarding infectious diseases in countries in which our merchandise is produced, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters that may occur overseas, or acts of war or terrorism, to the extent these acts affect the production, shipment, or receipt of merchandise. Our future operations and performance will be subject to these factors, and these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows or may require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs.\nWe rely on our good relationships with brand partners to purchase prestige, mass, and salon beauty products on reasonable terms, and to offer certain brands or products that are permanently or temporarily exclusive to us. If these relationships were to be impaired, or if certain brand partners were to change their distribution model or are unable to supply sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient selection or volume of merchandise on reasonable terms, and we may not be able to respond promptly to changing trends in beauty products, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe have no long-term supply agreements with brand partners, and therefore, our success depends on maintaining good relationships with our brand partners. Our business depends to a significant extent on the willingness and ability of our brand partners to supply us with a sufficient selection and volume of products to stock our stores. Some of our prestige brand partners may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans. We also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands, which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands. Any of our brand partners could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors, which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products. If we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing brand partners, or if we fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional brand partners of beauty products, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our competitive position.\nDuring fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, merchandise supplied to Ulta Beauty by our top ten brand partners accounted for approximately 54% and 55% of our net sales, respectively. There continues to be vendor consolidation within the beauty products industry. The loss of or a reduction in the amount of merchandise made available to us by any one of these key vendors, or by any of our other brand partners, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n\nWe also offer products that are permanently exclusive to us and offer a number of brands and products that are exclusive to us for a limited period of time or are offered in advance of our competitors. If our brand partners ceased granting us permanent or temporary exclusive rights our net sales could be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.\n\nIf we are unable to protect against inventory shrink, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n​\nOur business depends on our ability to effectively manage our inventory. Risk of inventory loss (also called shrink) is inherent in the retail business. We have historically experienced inventory shrink due to damage, theft (including from organized retail crime), and other causes. While some level of inventory shrink is unavoidable, in recent years we have experienced levels of inventory shrink greater than our historical levels, which have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our results of operations and financial condition. To protect against inventory shrink, we have taken, and may continue to take, certain operational and strategic actions that could adversely affect our reputation, guest experience, and results of operations.\n​\n\n\n17\n\n\n\nOur comparable sales and quarterly financial performance may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock. \nOur comparable sales and quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales and quarterly financial performance, including:\n\n●   general U.S. economic conditions and, in particular, the retail sales environment;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in our merchandising strategy or mix;\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n●   performance of our new and remodeled stores;\n------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the effectiveness of our inventory management;\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n●   timing and concentration of new store openings, including additional human resource requirements and related pre-opening and other start-up costs;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   cannibalization of existing store sales by new store openings;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities;\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   seasonal fluctuations due to weather conditions;\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n●   actions by our existing or new competitors; and\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n●   hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, earthquakes, mudslides, other natural disasters, epidemics or pandemics, and geopolitical events.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nAccordingly, our results for any one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter, and comparable sales for any particular future period may decrease. In that event, the price of our common stock may decline. \nThe capacity of our distribution and order fulfillment infrastructure and the performance of our distribution centers, fast fulfillment center, and market fulfillment centers may not be adequate to support our future growth, which could prevent the successful implementation of these plans or cause us to incur excess costs to expand this infrastructure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe currently operate four regional distribution centers, which house the distribution operations for Ulta Beauty retail stores together with the order fulfillment operations of our e-commerce platform, one fast fulfillment center (e-commerce only), and two market fulfillment centers, which focus on our most productive products and support e-commerce and retail stores. To support our expected future growth and to maintain the efficient operation of our business, it is likely additional distribution facilities will be added in the future. Our failure to effectively upgrade and expand our distribution capacity on a timely basis to keep pace with our anticipated growth in stores and the performance of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf our marketing, advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n​\nCustomer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising, marketing, and promotional activities. We use marketing, advertising, and promotional programs to attract customers through various media, including social media, websites, mobile applications, email, and print. Our future growth and profitability will depend in part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising and marketing programs. Further, disruption to certain media channels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nUse of social media may adversely impact our reputation.\nGiven the pervasive use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based and mobile communications, negative commentary regarding us or the products we sell may be adverse to our reputation or business. Customers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy or source. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\n\n\n18\n\n\n\nWe also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest, and LinkedIn accounts. As laws and regulations evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees, or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n\nIf we fail to retain our existing senior management team or attract qualified new personnel at all levels, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur business requires disciplined execution at all levels of our organization. This execution requires an experienced and talented management team. If we were to lose the benefit of the experience, efforts, and abilities of key executive personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Furthermore, our ability to manage our retail expansion requires us to continue to train, motivate, and manage our associates. We also need to attract, motivate, and retain additional qualified executive, managerial, and merchandising personnel and store and distribution center associates. Competition for this type of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting, assimilating, and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably. In addition, fluctuations in the cost of labor, including as a result of inflationary pressures on wages, may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.\n\nOur secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that could limit our operational flexibility, including our ability to open stores.\nWe have an $800.0 million secured revolving credit facility with a term expiring in March 2029. Substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the agreement. The credit facility agreement contains usual and customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay cash dividends and repurchase our stock, and merge or consolidate with another entity, and requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when availability under the agreement falls below a specified threshold. These covenants could restrict our operational flexibility and any failure to comply with these covenants or our payment obligations would limit our ability to borrow under the credit facility and, in certain circumstances, may allow the lenders thereunder to require repayment.\nEconomic, Market and Other External Risks\nMacroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. \n​\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, and elevated interest rates, as well as prior labor, transportation and shipping cost pressures, have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. We expect the impact of inflationary and macroeconomic pressures to continue in 2025, and we continue to closely monitor conditions, including customer behavior, and the impact of these factors on customer demand. Continuing or worsening inflation, and/or cost pressures, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and/or cash flows.\nAlthough we currently do not operate stores outside the United States, geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, have caused greater uncertainty in the global economy and exacerbated the inflation situation.\nThe health of the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally. We appeal to a wide demographic consumer profile and offer an extensive selection of beauty products sold directly to retail consumers and premium salon services. Uncertainty in the economy has, and could continue to, adversely impact consumer purchases of discretionary items across all of our product categories, including prestige beauty products and \n\n\n19\n\n\n\npremium salon services. Factors that could affect consumers’ willingness to make such discretionary purchases include: general business conditions, inflationary pressures, levels of employment, interest rates, tax rates, the availability of consumer credit, consumer confidence in future economic conditions, tariffs, risks related to epidemics or pandemics, geopolitical events and recessionary concerns. In the event of a prolonged period of inflation, an economic downturn or a recession, consumer spending habits could be adversely affected, and we could experience lower than expected net sales.\nIn addition, a general deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our commercial partners including our brand partners as well as the real estate developers and landlords who we rely on to construct and operate centers in which our stores are located. A bankruptcy or financial failure of a significant vendor or a number of significant real estate developers or shopping center landlords could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. Additionally, volatility and disruption to the capital and credit markets may have a significant, adverse impact on global economic conditions, resulting in inflationary or recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth, which, in turn, may lead to declines in consumer spending. Reduced consumer spending could cause changes in customer order patterns and changes in the level of merchandise purchased by our customers, and may signify a reset of consumer spending habits, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. \nWe may be unable to compete effectively in our highly competitive markets.\nThe markets for beauty products and salon services are highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, both small and large, including regional and national department stores, specialty retailers, drug stores, mass merchandisers, high-end and discount salon chains, locally owned beauty retailers and salons, online capabilities of national retailers, pure-play e-commerce companies, online marketplaces, catalog retailers, and direct response television, including television home shopping retailers and infomercials. We believe the principal bases upon which we compete are the breadth of merchandise, our value proposition, the quality of our guests’ shopping experience, and the convenience of our stores as one-stop destinations for beauty products and salon services. Many of our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing, and other resources and therefore, may be able to adapt to changes in customer requirements more quickly, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater national brand recognition, or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. As a result, we may lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nA reduction in traffic to, or the closing of, the other destination retailers in the shopping areas where our stores are located could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nAs a result of our real estate strategy, most of our stores are located in off-mall shopping areas known as power centers. Power centers typically contain three to five big-box anchor stores along with a variety of smaller specialty tenants. As a consequence of most of our stores being located in such shopping areas, our sales are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic generated by the other destination retailers and the anchor stores in power centers where our stores are located. Customer traffic to these shopping areas may be adversely affected by the closing of such destination retailers or anchor stores, or by a reduction in traffic to such stores resulting from a regional or global economic downturn, a public health crisis, a general downturn in the local area where our store is located, or a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment of a particular power center. Such a reduction in customer traffic would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. We may respond by increasing markdowns, initiating marketing promotions, or transferring product to other stores to reduce excess inventory, which would further decrease our gross profits and net income.\n\nEpidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, or other catastrophes or crises could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. \n​\nEpidemics, pandemics, or other public health crises, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornados, wildfires, earthquakes, and mudslides, as well as acts of violence or terrorism, have resulted in the temporary closure of our stores and, in the future, could also result in physical damage to our properties, the temporary closing of our stores, the \n\n\n20\n\n\n\ntemporary closing of our distribution, fast fulfillment, and market fulfillment centers, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products (or a substantial increase in the cost of those products) from domestic or foreign suppliers, the temporary disruption in the delivery of goods both to and from our distribution, fast fulfillment, and market fulfillment centers (or a substantial increase in the cost of those deliveries), the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and/or the temporary reduction in visits to stores by customers. Accordingly, if one or more epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, and/or acts of violence or terrorism were to occur in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows or may require us to incur increased costs.\n​\nOur stock repurchase programs could affect the price of our common stock and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program. Any such stock repurchase program adopted will not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Repurchases pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and the existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program. There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock.\n​\nClimate change might adversely impact our business operations and/or our supply chain.\n​\nScientific consensus shows that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will in the future cause changes in weather patterns around the globe. Climatologists predict these changes will result in the increased frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters which could disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers. These weather events could also lead to an increased rate of temporary store closures and reduced customer traffic at our stores. In addition, concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in new or additional legal, legislative, and/or regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. Any such new requirements could increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging, as well as our product supply chain and distribution costs.\n​\nThere is also increased focus, including by investors, guests, and other stakeholders, on climate change and other environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, including single use plastic, energy, waste and worker safety. Concern about climate change might cause consumer preferences to change, including moving away from products or ingredients considered to have high climate change impact and towards products that are more sustainably made, and we expect to incur additional costs in connection with our initiatives in this area.\n​\nOur reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to these matters and, taken together, these matters could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows, as well as our ability to meet the needs of our customers.\n​\nInformation Security, Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, Regulatory and Legal Risks\n​\nCybersecurity or information security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential guest, employee, Company and/or business partners’ information, damage our reputation, and expose us to liability, which could negatively impact our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process, and store sensitive and confidential data, including our proprietary business information and that of our guests, suppliers, and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our guests and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission, and storage of confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place and continual vigilance in regard to the protection of sensitive information, our systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, denial-of-service attacks, \n\n\n21\n\n\n\nbreak-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, human errors, or other similar events. Furthermore, we allow certain of our employees to work remotely, as certain of our third-party service providers also allow, and this remote working environment may increase cybersecurity related risks. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our business, products, and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems, successfully upgrade our information technology systems, or any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations, particularly during the holiday season.\nWe are dependent on a variety of information systems, including management, supply chain and financial information, and various other processes and transactions, to effectively manage our business. We also are expanding and upgrading our information systems (including the recent replacement of our enterprise resource planning platform through Project SOAR) to support historical and expected future growth. The failure of these projects, the failure of our information systems to perform as designed, or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our business and results of our operations. Any material disruption of our systems could disrupt our ability to track, record, and analyze the merchandise that we sell and could cause delays or cancellation of customer orders or impede the manufacture or shipment of products, the processing of transactions, our ability to receive and process e-commerce orders, and/or the reporting of financial results.\nOur e-commerce operations are increasingly important to our business. The Ulta.com website and our mobile applications serve as an effective extension of Ulta Beauty’s marketing and prospecting strategies by exposing potential new customers to the Ulta Beauty brand, product offerings, and enhanced content. As the importance of our website, mobile applications, and e-commerce operations to our business continues to grow, we are increasingly vulnerable to downtime and other technical failures. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks could reduce e-commerce sales and damage our brand’s reputation.\n\nFailure to maintain satisfactory compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations may subject us to negative financial consequences, including civil or criminal penalties, and harm our brand and reputation.\n​\nComplex local, state and national laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently (such as those enacted by California and certain other states) and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. Complying with these laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs, require changes to our business practices, and limit our ability to obtain data used to provide a differentiated guest experience. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by guests and other affected individuals, fines, and/or damage to our brand and reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n​\nLitigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims and the outcome of such litigation, proceedings or claims, including possible fines and penalties, could have a material adverse effect on our business and any loss contingency accruals may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation, including potential class action and single-plaintiff litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims in the ordinary course of our business operations regarding, but not limited to, employment matters, consumer claims, security of consumer and employee personal information, contractual relations \n\n\n22\n\n\n\nwith suppliers, marketing and infringement of trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. Litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties, may be necessary, which could absorb significant management time and/or result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows. We establish accruals for potential liability arising from litigation and other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims when potential liability is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated based on currently available information. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not accrued a liability. In addition, actual losses may be higher than the amount accrued for a certain matter, or in the aggregate. Any resolution of litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings or claims could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nSpecifically, our technologies, promotional products purchased from third-party vendors, and/or Ulta Beauty branded products, or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents, patent applications, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property rights of third parties in the United States and abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a third party were to bring an intellectual property infringement suit against us, we could be forced to stop or delay development, manufacturing, or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if, as a result of actual or threatened intellectual property infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be non-exclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. The inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly.\n\nIf our manufacturers are unable to produce products manufactured uniquely for Ulta Beauty, including Ulta Beauty Collection and Ulta Beauty branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements, we could suffer lost sales and be required to take costly corrective action, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third-party vendors for the manufacture of all products manufactured uniquely for Ulta Beauty, including Ulta Beauty Collection and Ulta Beauty branded gifts with purchase and other promotional products. The FDA does not currently have a pre-market approval system for cosmetics, but requires safety and efficacy substantiation. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be required to take costly corrective action. In addition, sanctions under various laws may include seizure of products, injunctions against future shipment of products, restitution and disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution. These events could interrupt the marketing and sale of our Ulta Beauty branded products, severely damage our brand reputation and image in the marketplace, increase the cost of our products, cause us to fail to meet customer expectations, or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores, any of which could result in lost sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n\nWe, as well as our vendors, are subject to laws and regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIn our U.S. markets, numerous laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels can affect our business. Legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. If we fail to comply with any present or future laws or regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, a prohibition on the operation of our stores, or a prohibition on \n\n\n23\n\n\n\nthe sale of our Ulta Beauty branded products. In particular, failure to adequately comply with the following legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n\n●   Our large workforce makes us vulnerable to changes in labor and employment laws. In addition, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs, which could hurt our profitability and affect our growth strategy.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Our salon operations are subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements for our stylists and our salon procedures. Failure to maintain compliance with these regulatory and licensing requirements could jeopardize the viability of our salons.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   We operate stores in California, which has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “Proposition 65” requiring that “clear and reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. Although we have sought to comply with Proposition 65 requirements, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to Proposition 65.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Future changes in healthcare reform legislation could significantly impact our business.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Evolving anti-discrimination laws could impact our efforts to support inclusion and belonging across our business for our guests, assortment, associates, brands, other partners, and stakeholders.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale, and storage of our vendors’ products and our Ulta Beauty branded products are also subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including FDA, FTC, CPSC, and various state and local agencies, such as State AGs and District Attorneys. If we, our vendors, or the manufacturers of our Ulta Beauty branded products fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties, claims, or product recalls, which could harm our results of operations, our reputation and/or our ability to conduct our business.\n\n\nAdditionally, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketability of our vendors’ products or our Ulta Beauty branded products, resulting in significant loss of net sales. Our failure to comply with federal, state, or local requirements when we advertise our products (including prices) or services, or engage in other promotional activities, in digital (including social media), television, or print may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products.\n\nOur associates or others may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with our policies and procedures.We are exposed to the risk of misconduct or other improper activities by our associates and third parties such as independent contractors or agents. Misconduct by associates, independent contractors, or agents could include inadvertent or intentional failures to comply with our policies and procedures, the laws and regulations to which we are subject, and/or ethical, social, product, labor, and environmental standards. Our current and former associates or independent contractors may also become subject to allegations of sexual harassment, racial and gender discrimination, or other similar misconduct, which, regardless of the ultimate outcome, may result in adverse publicity that could significantly harm our brand, reputation, and operations. Associate misconduct could also involve improper use of information obtained in the course of the associate’s prior or current employment, which could result in legal or regulatory action and harm to our reputation.\n​\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and our brand name, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nWe regard our trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. Our principal intellectual property rights include registered and common law trademarks on “The Possibilities are Beautiful.®,” “Ulta Beauty®,” “Ulta®,” and other marks incorporating our name and “All Things Beauty. All in One Place®,” “21 Days of Beauty®,” and “Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty®,” copyrights in our website and mobile applications content, rights to our domain name www.ulta.com, and trade secrets and know-how with respect to our Ulta Beauty branded product formulations, product sourcing, sales and marketing, and other aspects of our business, \n\n\n24\n\n\n\nand our digital innovations such as try-on applications and artificial intelligence. As such, we rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality agreements with certain of our employees, consultants, suppliers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights for any reason (including any cybersecurity incident that results in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights), or if other parties infringe on our intellectual property rights, our brand and reputation could be impaired, and we could lose customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nIn addition, we license certain of our trademarks to some of our business partners. While we enter into comprehensive agreements with our business partners covering, among other things, use of our brand name, the value of our brand and our reputation could be impaired to the extent that our business partners do not operate their businesses, including their stores or websites, in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a business partner, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, cash flows and reputation.\n​\nOur Ulta Beauty branded products and salon services may cause unexpected and undesirable side effects that could result in their discontinuance or expose us to lawsuits, either of which could result in unexpected costs and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nUnexpected and undesirable side effects caused by our Ulta Beauty branded products for which we have not provided sufficient label warnings or salon services, which may have been performed negligently, could result in the discontinuance of sales of our products or of certain salon services or prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected products and services. Such side effects could also expose us to product liability or negligence lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is in excess of our policy limits would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. These events could cause negative publicity regarding our Company, brand, or products, which could in turn harm our reputation and net sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\n\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of the Company would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, and harm the market price of our common stock and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\n●   authorizing our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and additional shares of our common stock without stockholder approval;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent;\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   prohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; and\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at stockholders’ meetings.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that, in general, prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years after the stockholder becomes a 15% stockholder, subject to specified exceptions. Together, these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.",
