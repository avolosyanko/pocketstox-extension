      "text": "ITEM 1.    Business \nBUSINESS\nOverview\nVentas, Inc., an S&P 500 company, is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) focused on delivering strong, sustainable shareholder returns by enabling exceptional environments that benefit a large and growing aging population. We hold a portfolio that includes senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings, research centers, hospitals and healthcare facilities located in North America and the United Kingdom. As of December 31, 2024, we owned or had investments in 1,387 properties consisting of 1,356 properties in our reportable business segments (“Segment Properties”) and 31 properties held by unconsolidated real estate entities in our non-segment operations. Our Company is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional corporate offices in Louisville, Kentucky and New York, New York.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999. Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of technical requirements, which impact how we invest in, operate and manage our assets. See “Risk Factors—Our REIT Status Risks” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Annual Report”).\nWe operate through three reportable business segments: senior housing operating portfolio, which we refer to as “SHOP,” outpatient medical and research portfolio, which we refer to as “OM&R,” and triple-net leased properties, which we refer to as “NNN.” We also hold assets outside of our reportable business segments, which we refer to as non-segment assets and which consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and accounts receivable as well as investments in unconsolidated entities. Our investments in unconsolidated entities include investments made through our third-party institutional private capital management platform, Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”). Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles where we are the sponsor or general partner, including our open-ended investment vehicle, the Ventas Life Science & Healthcare Real Estate Fund (the “Ventas Fund”). See our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes, including “Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Entities” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nOur chief operating decision maker evaluates performance of the combined properties in each operating segment and determines how to allocate resources to these segments, based on net operating income (“NOI”) for each segment. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes, including “Note 2 – Accounting Policies” and “Note 18 – Segment Information” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \nThe following table summarizes information for our portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\n\nSegment                                                                NOI (1)                Percentage of Total NOI                  Segment Properties\nSenior housing operating portfolio (SHOP)                        $866,383                              41.9         %                        629         \nOutpatient medical and research portfolio (OM&amp;R)              579,271                              28.0         %                        426         \nTriple-net leased properties (NNN)                                606,225                              29.3         %                        301         \nNon-segment (2)                                                    17,204                               0.8         %                                 n/a\n                                                               $2,069,083                               100         %                      1,356         \n______________________________\n(1)    “NOI” is defined as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and third-party capital management expenses. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional disclosure and a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), to NOI.\n(2)    NOI for non-segment includes management fees and promote revenues, net of expenses related to our third-party institutional private capital management platform, income from loans and investments and corporate-level expenses not directly attributable to any of our three reportable business segments.\nBusiness Strategy\nFor more than 25 years, Ventas has pursued what we believe is a successful, enduring strategy focused on delivering outsized value to stockholders and other key stakeholders by enabling exceptional environments that benefit the aging population. Working with industry-leading care providers, partners, developers and research and medical institutions, our collaborative and experienced team is focused on achieving consistent, superior total returns through: (1) delivering profitable organic growth in senior housing, (2) capturing value-creating external growth focused on senior housing, (3) driving strong execution and cash flow generation throughout our portfolio of high-quality assets unified in serving the large and growing aging population and (4) maintaining financial strength, flexibility and liquidity. \nOur objective is to generate reliable and growing cash flows from our portfolio, which enables us to pay regular cash dividends to stockholders and creates opportunities to increase stockholder value.\nOur Businesses \nSenior Housing Operating Portfolio (SHOP)\nIn our SHOP segment, we own and invest in senior housing communities. We participate directly in the financial performance of the communities’ operations and are generally responsible for all operational costs, expenses and other liabilities. We typically engage third-party managers to operate the communities on our behalf but generally hold applicable healthcare licenses and enroll in applicable government healthcare programs on behalf of the communities in our SHOP segment. \nThe senior housing communities in our SHOP segment include independent living communities, assisted living communities, memory care communities and continuing care retirement communities. Independent living communities are typically age-restricted multifamily rental properties with central dining facilities that provide residents with access to meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation and social and recreational activities. Assisted living communities typically offer similar services as independent living communities, plus supportive care that is provided by trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing and medication management. Memory care communities provide care for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia or memory loss. Continuing care retirement communities are typically age-restricted properties that offer a continuum of care, and may include a combination of independent living, assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing units. Our assisted living, memory care and continuing care retirement communities are generally subject to state licensure requirements for the delivery of some or all of their services, while our independent living communities generally are not. Charges for room, board and services at these communities are generally paid from private sources, with limited reliance on government reimbursement programs such as Medicaid. \nBecause we have elected to be taxed as a REIT, we are subject to restrictions impacting how we invest in, operate or manage our properties, including the senior housing communities in our SHOP segment. Some of those restrictions depend on whether a senior housing community is treated as a “qualified healthcare property” under the REIT rules. We treat most of the senior housing communities in our SHOP segment as “qualified healthcare properties.” Senior housing communities in our SHOP segment that are “qualified healthcare properties” generally must be managed and operated by a third-party manager, including for purposes of procuring supplies, hiring and training employees, entering into third-party contracts for the benefit of the property and providing resident care and services. Senior housing communities that are not “qualified healthcare properties” may be managed by us directly through a taxable REIT subsidiary or by a third-party manager. See “—Government Regulation—Tax Regulation included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.”\nWhere we engage a third-party manager, either by choice or as required by REIT tax rules, we generally rely on the third-party managers’ personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, risk management processes, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage the senior housing communities’ operations efficiently and effectively. We also rely on the third-party managers to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results in a timely manner and otherwise manage risk and operate the senior housing communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. We are generally responsible for all operational costs, expenses and other risks and liabilities. While our managers typically indemnify us for liabilities arising out of certain of their actions such as gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct, we may not be able to enforce these rights, or we may determine it is not prudent to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—Our third-party managers and tenants operate or exert substantial control over the properties that they manage for or rent from us, \nwhich limits our control and influence over operations and results” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—Our operating assets may expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nOur management agreements typically have fixed terms and are subject to renewal under certain conditions. These agreements may include provisions for termination under specific circumstances, with or without the payment of a fee. The managers generally receive annual management fees which are calculated based on various performance measures, which may include revenue, NOI and other objective financial metrics. Additionally, incentive fees may be awarded if specified performance targets are met.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, 28 third-party managers operated all of the 629 properties in our SHOP segment on our behalf. The following table provides information regarding our significant SHOP manager concentration as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n\n                                     Percentage of Total NOI                  Segment Properties                Percentage of Segment Properties\nAtria Senior Living, Inc.                     18.6         %                        199                                        14.7            %\nSunrise Senior Living, LLC                     6.2                                   98                                         7.2             \nLe Groupe Maurice                              6.0                                   37                                         2.7             \nThe properties in our SHOP segment managed by Atria Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Atria”), Sunrise Senior Living, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Sunrise”) and Le Group Maurice (together with its subsidiaries, “Le Groupe Maurice”) accounted for a significant portion of our SHOP segment revenues and NOI for the year ended December 31, 2024. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Concentration risk” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—A significant portion of our revenues and operating income is dependent on a limited number of managers and tenants, including Atria, Sunrise, Le Groupe Maurice, Brookdale, Ardent and Kindred” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nWe hold a 34% ownership interest in Atria, which entitles us to customary minority rights and protections, as well as the right to appoint two members to the Atria Board of Directors. See Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Entities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for a further discussion of our ownership interest.\nOutpatient Medical and Research Portfolio (OM&R)\nIn our OM&R segment, we primarily acquire, own, develop, lease and manage outpatient medical buildings and research centers. \nOur outpatient medical buildings, which are predominantly located on or contiguous to a health system campus, are generally multi-tenant properties leased to health systems and several unrelated medical practices, although in many cases they may be associated with a large single specialty or multi-specialty group, including neighboring health systems. Tenants typically require customized space devoted to patient examination and treatment, diagnostic imaging, outpatient surgery and other outpatient services. Outpatient medical buildings typically require enhanced plumbing, electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate the needs of healthcare providers such as sinks in every room, brighter lights and specialized medical equipment. \nOur research centers generally contain laboratory and office space that is leased primarily to universities, academic medical centers, technology, biotechnology, medical device and pharmaceutical companies and other organizations involved in the research industry. While these properties may have certain characteristics similar to commercial office buildings, they generally contain more advanced electrical, mechanical, heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems. The facilities generally have specialty equipment including emergency generators, fume hoods, lab bench tops and related amenities. In many instances, research center tenants make significant investments to improve their leased space, in addition to landlord improvements, to accommodate biology, chemistry or medical device research initiatives. Our research centers are often located on or contiguous to university and academic medical campuses. \nWe lease these properties to tenants under varying lease types that obligate the tenants to pay rent, and may require the tenant to pay their proportionate share of some or all property-related expenses, including utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, \nrepairs and maintenance, cleaning, roads and grounds expense and other expenses. The leases are typically for a fixed term, and may be subject to renewal under certain conditions. \nAlthough we do not participate directly in the financial performance of our tenants’ operations, we are exposed to the credit risk of our tenants in our OM&R segment. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—If our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ financial condition or business prospects deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nThrough our Lillibridge subsidiary and our 50% ownership interest in PMB Real Estate Services LLC (“PMBRES”), a property management platform, we provide outpatient medical building and research center management, leasing, marketing, facility development and advisory services to highly rated hospitals and health systems and universities, academic medical centers, biotech and other similar companies throughout the United States. \nTriple-Net Leased Properties (NNN)\nIn our NNN segment, we invest in and own senior housing communities, skilled nursing facilities (“SNFs”), long-term acute care facilities (“LTACs”), freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) and other healthcare facilities. \nThe senior housing communities in our NNN segment may include independent living communities, assisted living communities, memory care communities and continuing care retirement communities, which property types are described in more detail above in “—Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (SHOP).” \nSNFs provide rehabilitative, restorative, skilled nursing and medical treatment for patients and residents who do not require the high technology, care-intensive, high-cost setting of an acute care or rehabilitation hospital. Treatment programs include physical, occupational, speech, respiratory and other therapies, including sub-acute clinical protocols such as wound care and intravenous drug treatment. \nLTACs typically serve medically complex, chronically ill patients who require a high 1evel of monitoring and specialized care, but whose conditions do not necessitate the continued services of an intensive care unit and have a Medicare average length of stay of greater than 25 days. The tenants of these LTACs have the capability to treat patients who suffer from multiple systemic failures or conditions such as neurological disorders, head injuries, brain stem and spinal cord trauma, cerebral vascular accidents, chemical brain injuries, central nervous system disorders, developmental anomalies and cardiopulmonary disorders. Chronic patients often depend on technology for continued life support, such as mechanical ventilators, total parenteral nutrition, respiration or cardiac monitors and dialysis machines, and, due to their severe medical conditions, generally are not clinically appropriate for admission to a skilled nursing facility or rehabilitation hospital. \nIRFs are devoted to the rehabilitation of patients with various neurological, musculoskeletal, orthopedic and other medical conditions following stabilization of their acute medical issues. Other healthcare facilities provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. These other healthcare facilities may also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. \nCharges for services provided at SNFs, LTACs, IRFs and other healthcare facilities are generally paid from a combination of government reimbursement, commercial insurance and other private sources.\nWe lease these properties to tenants under triple-net or absolute-net leases that obligate the tenants to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures. The leases in our NNN segment typically contain annual or periodic rent escalators that may be contingent upon the satisfaction of specified facility revenue parameters or based on increases in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”), with caps, floors or collars. These agreements may include provisions for termination under specific circumstances, including in the event of a monetary or non-monetary default by the tenant or in the event of a failure of the tenant to meet certain financial or operational covenants. The agreements typically include broad indemnities in our favor from the tenant for liabilities arising out of the tenant’s operations. Although we do not participate directly in the financial performance of the tenants’ operations, we are exposed to the credit risk of our tenants in our NNN segment. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—If our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ financial condition or business prospects deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nThe following table provides information regarding our significant triple-net leased tenant concentration as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n\n                                              Percentage of Total NOI                  Segment Properties                Percentage of Segment Properties\nBrookdale Senior Living, Inc. (1)                       7.2         %                        121                                         8.9            %\nKindred Healthcare, LLC                                 6.7                                   34                                         2.5             \nArdent Health Partners, LLC (2)                         6.6                                   11                                         0.8             \n______________________________\n(1)Excludes nine properties managed by Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. pursuant to long-term management agreements and included in the SHOP segment.\n(2)We also lease 19 outpatient medical buildings to Ardent, which are included in the OM&R segment.\nThe properties we lease to Brookdale Senior Living, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Brookdale”), Ardent Health Partners, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Ardent”) and Kindred Healthcare, LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “Kindred”) accounted for a significant portion of our NNN segment revenues and NOI for the year ended December 31, 2024. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—A significant portion of our revenues and operating income is dependent on a limited number of managers and tenants, including Atria, Sunrise, Le Groupe Maurice, Brookdale, Ardent and Kindred” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— “Concentration Risk,” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report and “Note 3 – Concentration of Credit Risk” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we held warrants for 11.1 million shares of Brookdale common stock, which are exercisable at any time prior to December 31, 2025 and have an exercise price of $3.00 per share (the “Brookdale Warrants”). In addition, we hold warrants exercisable at any time prior to September 13, 2034 for 9.9% of the common equity of a parent company of Kindred exercisable at the pre-transaction value of such common equity (the “Scion Warrants”). See “Note 9 – Other Assets” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we held an approximately 6.7% ownership interest in Ardent. See “Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Entities” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for a further discussion of our ownership interest.\nNon-Segment Assets\nNon-segment assets consist primarily of corporate assets, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, loans receivable and investments and accounts receivable. Our loans receivable and investments generally provide us with interest income and fees and are often secured by mortgage liens or leasehold mortgages on the underlying properties and corporate or personal guarantees by affiliates of the borrowing entity. In some cases, the loans are secured by a pledge of ownership interests in the entity or entities that own the related properties or may take the form of mezzanine loans, which are subordinated to senior secured loans held by other investors that encumber the same real estate. Non-segment assets also include other assets, such as our Brookdale and Kindred Warrants. See “Note 6 – Loans Receivable and Investments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. Although we do not participate directly in the financial performance of the operations of our borrowers’ properties, we are directly exposed to the credit risk of our borrowers and therefore indirectly to the operational risks of our borrowers. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—If our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ financial condition or business prospects deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nNon-segment assets also include our investments in unconsolidated entities, including investments in unconsolidated real estate entities through our third-party institutional private capital management platform, VIM, and investments in unconsolidated operating entities, such as Ardent and Atria. Through VIM, we partner with third-party institutional investors to invest in real estate through various joint ventures and other co-investment vehicles. In these arrangements, we are typically the general partner and earn fees as a result of that service. The assets in our VIM business are primarily comprised of three platforms: the Ventas Fund, a state pension fund joint venture and a sovereign wealth fund joint venture. The Ventas Fund is a perpetual life vehicle focused on investments in core and core plus life science, outpatient medical and senior housing real estate in North America. Our state pension fund joint venture is principally focused on investment in ground up development and value added redevelopment of senior housing. Our sovereign wealth fund joint venture is focused on university-based research and innovation development projects. In the Ventas Fund and certain other ventures, we have the ability to earn \nrevenues through incentive fees periodically during the life of a venture. See “Note 7 – Investments in Unconsolidated Entities” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. \nDevelopment and Redevelopment Activities\nFrom time to time, we engage in development and redevelopment activities within our reportable business segments and through our investments in unconsolidated entities. For example, we are party to certain agreements that commit us to develop properties funded through capital that we and, in certain circumstances, our joint venture partners provide. As of December 31, 2024, we had three active and committed projects pursuant to these agreements, including two projects that are unconsolidated. In addition, from time to time, we engage in redevelopment projects with respect to our existing senior housing communities, outpatient medical buildings and research centers to maximize the value, increase NOI, maintain a market-competitive position, achieve property stabilization or change the primary use of the property.\nGeographic Diversification of Properties\nOur portfolio of assets is broadly diversified by geographic location throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, with properties in only one state (California) accounting for more than 10% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—”Concentration Risk.” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report. \nCompetition\nWe generally compete for investments in real estate with publicly traded, private and non-listed healthcare REITs, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition challenges our ability to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives, which is affected by, among other factors, the availability of suitable acquisition or investment targets, our ability to negotiate acceptable transaction terms and our access to and cost of capital. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—Our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon identifying and consummating future acquisitions and investments and effectively managing our expansion opportunities” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and “Note 10 – Senior Notes Payable and Other Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nOur managers, tenants and borrowers typically compete on a local and regional basis with other organizations that provide comparable services. They typically compete to attract and retain residents and patients to our properties based on scope and quality of care, reputation and financial condition, price, location and physical appearance of the properties, services offered, qualified personnel, physician referrals and family preferences. With respect to outpatient medical buildings and research centers, we and our third-party managers compete to attract and retain tenants based on many of the same factors, in addition to quality of the affiliated health system or university, physician preferences and proximity to hospital or university campuses or research centers and quality of lab space. The ability of our managers, tenants and borrowers to compete successfully could be affected by private, federal and state reimbursement programs and other laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors—Our Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks—We and our managers, tenants and borrowers may be adversely affected by regulation and enforcement” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nHuman Capital Management\nAt Ventas, our experienced team drives our success and creates value. As of December 31, 2024, we had 498 employees, none of which are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.\nWe provide a unique environment that offers opportunities for our team to use their professional skills, develop their talents and learn from each other as they build successful careers. We are committed to upholding human dignity and equal opportunity under the principles outlined in the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, Vendor Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy embed the responsibility to respect human rights in business functions across our operations as well as our supply chain.\nThe Compensation Committee and Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility (“NGCR”) Committee of our Board of Directors provide oversight on certain human capital matters, goals and framework. We report on human capital matters regularly to our Compensation Committee and periodically to our Board of Directors. The most significant human capital measures and objectives that we focus on include the topics described below.\nTalent Acquisition, Development and Retention\nWe strive to foster a culture that attracts and retains individuals who share a passion for integrity, flawless execution, collaborative problem-solving and, above all, excellence. A key component of our ability to attract and retain the top talent in our industry is our investment in our people and their continuous development by providing expansive professional opportunities, best-in-class leadership development and a broad array of workshops and training. \nEmployee engagement and employee satisfaction contribute to our ability to attract and retain top talent. Each year, we conduct an employee engagement survey through an independent third party, which measures our progress on key employee issues and identifies opportunities for evolving our programs.\nCompensation and Benefits\nVentas prides itself in offering an industry-leading compensation and benefits package. Our benefits programs include a robust offering of medical, dental, vision, life, accidental death and dismemberment, disability plans and wellness programs, all of which require very low employee contributions or are offered at no cost to employees. We also provide other ancillary benefits at competitive group rates that allow employees to customize benefits to best meet their needs. The Ventas retirement plans consist of a 401(k) profit sharing plan with both pretax and Roth offerings and competitive employer matching contributions.\nHealth & Safety\nVentas is committed to the health and safety of its employees. Helping to make our workplaces secure and hazard-free is a responsibility shared with each Ventas employee. Our commitment to health and safety is maintained by effective administration, training and education, and we expect our operating and development partners to comply with applicable company and legal requirements.\nOrganizational Resilience\nOur talented employee base is the foundation of our organizational resilience. As part of our employee value proposition, in addition to competitive compensation and benefits offerings, we invest in growth, development opportunities and comprehensive performance management for our employees that empower them to realize their full potential, expand their capabilities and fill critical roles within the organization. Our employee base is comprised of a mix of longer tenured employees, who contribute deep institutional experience and knowledge, and shorter tenured employees, who contribute new perspectives and ways of doing things. As of December 31, 2024, more than 40% of our employees have been promoted or transferred internally for new opportunities, reflecting our deep commitment to creating an environment where people can build their careers. \nThe Nominating, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee leads, and the Board oversees and reviews at least annually, a robust short- and long-term succession planning process for our senior management team, including our CEO. In general, our management succession planning is designed to anticipate both “planned” successions, such as those arising from anticipated retirements, and unplanned succession events, including emergencies and a range of other potential contingencies. \nThe CEO and Vice President, Human Resources support the annual succession plan review conducted by the Nominating, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee by providing information about each executive role and succession scenarios, including an overview of each potential successor’s experience and potential, readiness assessment and planned leadership development opportunities. The independent members of the Board also regularly interact with executives across several leadership levels of Ventas through management presentations at the Board meetings and other informal events to form their own independent assessment of senior leaders. \nBoth the Nominating, Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Board also regularly review strength and gaps in the executive and senior management team and their organizations with the Company’s long-term strategy and goal of optimizing performance in mind. When appropriate, action plans are identified and executed to drive performance, enhance organizational resilience and support succession planning, including for the CEO. We engage third party experts where appropriate to bring additional insights to, and facilitate, succession planning, conduct assessments and provide coaching and development to executives and others in cases where the Company and the employee will benefit.\nCorporate Sustainability\nVentas has a robust, data-driven strategy designed to support the sustainable growth of our business and build long-term value for shareholders and other key stakeholders. Three priorities guide our efforts:\n•Our Impact: Enabling Sustainable Environments and Strong Communities\n•Our Employees: Empowering Exceptional People\n•Our Standards: Leading in Governance and Transparency\nVentas has set measurable goals related to each of our key sustainability topics and progress towards these goals is reported annually in our Corporate Sustainability Report.\nThese matters are overseen by our NGCR Committee. Our EVP, General Counsel and Ethics & Compliance Officer and VP, Corporate ESG & Sustainability report on these matters regularly to the NGCR Committee and periodically to our Board of Directors.\nInsurance\nWe maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our managers, tenants or other counterparties maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in each industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. The insurance that we maintain or require may take the form of commercial insurance, captive insurance or self-insurance.\nWe maintain the property insurance for a vast majority of our properties in our OM&R and SHOP segments. We also maintain liability insurance for certain outpatient medical properties, as well as the general and professional liability insurance for certain senior housing communities and related operations in our SHOP segment. However, some senior housing managers maintain the general and professional liability insurance for our senior housing communities and related operations that they manage in accordance with the terms of our management agreements. \nThrough our OM&R segment, we provide engineering, construction and architectural services in connection with new development projects, and we maintain and cause tenants, contractors, design professionals and other parties involved with such services to maintain property and liability insurance with respect to those activities.\nIn May 2020, the Company formed a wholly-owned captive insurance company, which provides insurance coverage for losses below the deductible and within the self-insured retention of the commercial property, general and professional liability insurance that we maintain for certain of our outpatient medical and senior housing locations.\nAdditional Information\nWe maintain a website at www.ventasreit.com and an Investor Relations website at ir.ventasreit.com. We use our Investor Relations website as a means of disclosing material information. Accordingly, investors should monitor our Investor Relations website in addition to following our press releases, SEC filings and public conference calls and webcasts. The information on our website and our Investor Relations website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, and our web addresses are included as an inactive textual reference only.\nWe make available, free of charge, through our Investor Relations website, our Annual Report, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. In addition, our Guidelines on Governance, our Global Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (including waivers from and amendments to that document) and the charters for each of our Audit and Compliance, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees are available on our website, and we will mail copies of the foregoing documents to stockholders, free of charge, upon request to our Corporate Secretary at Ventas, Inc., 300 North LaSalle Street, Suite 1600, Chicago, Illinois 60654.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nUnited States Healthcare Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement\nOverview\nWe, along with our managers, tenants and borrowers in the United States, are subject to or impacted by extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to quality of care, licensure and certificates of need (“CON”), conduct of operations, government reimbursement, such as Medicare and Medicaid, fraud and abuse, qualifications of personnel, appropriateness and classification of care, adequacy of plant and equipment and data privacy and cybersecurity. In our SHOP segment, these laws and regulations typically apply directly to us and our senior housing communities, where we generally hold the applicable healthcare licenses. In some instances, we enroll in government reimbursement programs, such as Medicaid. In our other segments, our tenants and borrowers are typically subject to these laws and regulations. Imposition of sanctions associated with these laws and regulations could adversely affect the tenant’s or borrower’s ability to satisfy its obligations to us. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—Our operating assets may expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—If our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ financial condition or business prospects deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nHealthcare laws and regulations are wide-ranging, and noncompliance may result in the imposition of civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, including: the loss or suspension of accreditation, licenses or CONs; suspension of or non-payment for new admissions; denial of reimbursement; fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs; or facility closure. Changes in laws or regulations, reimbursement policies, enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by us or our managers, tenants or borrowers could have a significant effect on our and their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under “Risk Factors—Our Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nLicensure, Certification and CONs\nSenior housing communities, other than independent living communities, are subject to state and local laws that may require licenses, certifications and permits, and may vary greatly from one jurisdiction to another. Our senior housing communities that receive Medicaid payments are also subject to extensive federal laws and regulation. Our tenants or borrowers who operate other facilities, such as SNFs, LTACs, IRFs, health systems and medical practices, are typically subject to extensive federal and state regulation and must hold various licenses, certifications, and permits. Licensure and certification may be conditioned on requirements related to, among other things, the quality of medical care provided, compliance with staffing levels and reporting requirements, qualifications of the operator’s administrative personnel and clinical staff, adequacy of the physical plant and equipment and continuing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Sanctions for failure to comply with licensure and certification laws and regulations include loss of licensure or certification and ability to participate in or receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, suspension of or non-payment for new admissions, fines, and potential criminal penalties. \nMany of our licensed facilities, tenants and borrowers are subject to state CON laws, which require governmental approval prior to the development or expansion of licensed facilities and services. The approval process in states with CON laws generally requires a facility to demonstrate the need for additional or expanded licensed facilities or services. CONs, where applicable, are also sometimes necessary for changes in ownership or control of licensed facilities, addition of beds, investment in major capital equipment, introduction of new services or termination of services previously approved through the CON process. CON laws and regulations may restrict our or our tenants’ ability to expand and grow in certain circumstances, which could have an adverse effect on our or their revenues.\nFraud and Abuse Enforcement\nParticipants in the U.S. healthcare industry are subject to complex federal and state civil and criminal laws and regulations governing healthcare provider referrals, relationships and arrangements. These laws include: (i) federal and state false claims acts, which generally prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs; (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or generate business involving healthcare items or services payable by Medicare or Medicaid; (iii) federal and state physician \nself-referral laws, which generally prohibit referrals of certain services by physicians to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship; and (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws and prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services.\nViolating these healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations may result in criminal and civil penalties, such as punitive sanctions, damage assessments, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These laws and regulations are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local governmental agencies, and many can also be enforced by private litigants through federal and state false claims acts and other laws that allow private individuals to bring whistleblower suits known as qui tam actions.\nReimbursement\nSources of revenue for us and some of our tenants and borrowers include, among others, governmental healthcare programs, such as the federal Medicare programs and state Medicaid programs, and non-governmental third-party payors, such as insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations. Medicare is a federal health insurance program for persons aged 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a medical assistance program for eligible needy persons that is funded jointly by federal and state governments and administered by the states. Medicaid eligibility requirements and benefits vary by state. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation, regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. \nFederal and state governments may from time to time reduce Medicare and Medicaid spending through methods such as reductions in reimbursement rates and increased enrollment in managed care programs. Private payors, such as insurance companies, are typically for-profit companies and are continuously seeking opportunities to control healthcare costs. In some cases, private payors rely on government reimbursement systems to determine reimbursement rates, such that reductions in Medicare and Medicaid payment rates may negatively impact payments from private payors. These changes may result in reduced or slower growth in reimbursement for certain services provided by some of our tenants and borrowers. Additionally, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that directly or indirectly affect reimbursement. Several of these laws, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”), have promoted shifting from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement models to alternative payment models that tie reimbursement to quality and cost of care, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments. It is difficult to predict the nature and success of future financial or delivery system reforms, but changes to reimbursement rates and related policies could adversely impact our and our tenants’ results of operations.\nCARES Act and Similar Governmental Funding Programs\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, Congress enacted a series of economic stimulus and relief measures through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Other domestic, foreign, local, regional or national governments also implemented similar grant programs. We, and our managers, tenants and borrowers, applied for and received grants under these types of government programs.\nThe HHS Office of Inspector General, the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee and other governments each may have the right to conduct audits of our, or our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’, use of funds from such programs and may have the right to recoup some or all of the payments if it determines those payments were not made or the funds not used in compliance with its rules, regulations and interpretive guidance.\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity\nWe and our managers, tenants and borrowers are subject to federal and state laws and regulations related to data privacy and cybersecurity. In most cases, we depend on our managers, tenants and borrowers to fulfill any compliance obligations with respect to these data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations.\nFor example, data privacy and cybersecurity regulations issued pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (“HIPAA”), restrict the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (“protected health information” or “PHI”), provide for individual rights and require safeguards for PHI and notification of breaches of unsecure PHI. Entities subject to HIPAA include most healthcare providers, including some of our managers, tenants and borrowers. These covered entities are required to implement administrative, physical and technical \npractices to protect the security of PHI that is electronically maintained or transmitted. Business associates of covered entities who create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI are also subject to certain HIPAA provisions. Violations of HIPAA may result in substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties. The Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. and regulate unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including with respect to data privacy and cybersecurity. Moreover, the U.S. Congress has recently considered, and is currently considering, various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity legislation to which we or our managers, tenants and borrowers may be subject if passed. \nData privacy and cybersecurity are also areas of increasing state legislative focus, and states are increasingly proposing or enacting legislation that relates to data privacy and cybersecurity. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the “CCPA”), gives California residents certain rights with respect to their personal information. Other states where we or our managers, tenants or borrowers do business, or may in the future do business, have enacted, or are considering enacting, comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity laws that share similarities with the CCPA, for example the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, effective as of July 1, 2024. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states and most U.S. territories generally require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach, and we or our managers, tenants or borrowers may be required to report events related to data privacy or cybersecurity issues, events where customer information may be compromised, unauthorized access to our or their systems or networks and other security breaches, to affected individuals or the relevant regulatory authorities. These state statutes, and other similar federal and state laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future, may require us or our managers, tenants or borrowers to modify our or their data processing practices and policies, incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses and otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our or their business.\nInternational Healthcare Regulation\nWe own senior housing communities in Canada and the United Kingdom. Senior living residences in Canada are provincially regulated. Within each province, there are different categories for senior living residences that are generally based on the level of care sought or required by a resident (e.g., assisted or retirement living, senior living residences, residential care, long-term care). In some of these categories and depending on the province, residences may be government funded, or the individual residents may be eligible for a government subsidy, while other residences are exclusively private-pay. The governing legislation and regulations vary by province, but generally impose licensing requirements and requirements related to quality control, public health, infection control and other care-related operating standards. These laws empower regulators in each province to take a variety of steps to ensure compliance, conduct inspections, issue reports and generally regulate the industry. Our communities in Canada are also subject to data privacy and cybersecurity legislation, including, in certain provinces, data privacy and cybersecurity laws specifically related to personal health information. Although the obligations of senior living residences in the various provinces differ, they all include the obligation to protect personal information. The powers of data privacy and cybersecurity regulators and penalties for violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts. Our senior living residences in Canada are also subject to a variety of other laws and regulations, including minimum wage standards and other employment laws. \nIn the United Kingdom, our senior housing communities are principally regulated as “care home services” under the Health and Social Care Act 2008. This legislation subjects service providers to standards of care and requires, among other things, that all persons carrying out such activities, and the managers of such persons, be registered. Providers of care home services are also subject (as data controllers) to the U.K.’s Data Protection Act 2018, as supplemented by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation as implemented into U.K. law (collectively, “UK GDPR”), which governs the processing of personal data (including in relation to employees, clients and recipients of care home services). The UK GDPR imposes a significant number of obligations on data controllers with the potential for fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover or £17.5 million, whichever is greater. Our business operations in the United Kingdom are also subject to a range of other regulations, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. \nRegulation Impacting Life Sciences Research\nSome of our tenants, including university-affiliated organizations and private sector companies, conduct life sciences, medical device or related research. These tenants may be dependent on the public markets, private investors, the federal government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), or other sources of funding to support their activities. Creating a new pharmaceutical product or medical device requires substantial investments of time and capital, in part because of the extensive regulation of the healthcare industry; it also entails considerable risk of failure in demonstrating that the product is safe and effective and in gaining regulatory approval and market acceptance. Therefore, these tenants may face high levels of regulation, expense and uncertainty. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—Our research tenants face unique levels of expense and uncertainty” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nOur tenants with marketable products may be adversely affected by healthcare reform and government reimbursement policies, including changes under the current presidential administration or by private healthcare payors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—Changes in the U.S. political and regulatory environment could affect availability of government funding that we or our managers, tenants or borrowers rely on, which could negatively impact our business” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report\nTax Regulation\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1999. Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” that ordinarily results from investment in a C corporation. We are required to pay income tax in certain circumstances, including on taxable income earned by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. \nIn addition, we are subject to state and local tax in the U.S. and certain states do not conform completely to the federal income tax rules. We also are subject to non-U.S. tax on our operations in Canada and in the U.K., as our U.S. REIT status does not by itself afford us special tax status in those countries. We attempt to structure our investments outside of the U.S. in the most efficient manner possible, but do expect to incur some tax expense on our non-U.S. operations, which could increase due to tax rate increases, interest expense limitations or other changes in law. In particular, recently finalized legislation related to interest expense deductibility in Canada may have a significant impact on our income tax expense and cash taxes. See “Risk Factors—Our REIT Status Risks—Legislative or other actions affecting REITs or taxes could have a negative effect on our stockholders or us” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nThe Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association: \n(1) that is managed by one or more trustees or directors; \n(2) that issues transferable shares or transferable certificates to evidence its beneficial ownership; \n(3) that would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code;\n(4) that is not a financial institution or an insurance company within the meaning of certain provisions of the Code;\n(5) that is beneficially owned by 100 or more persons; \n(6) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals, including certain specified entities, during the last half of each taxable year; and\n(7) that meets other tests, regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions. \nWe believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us, and will continue to allow us, to satisfy conditions (1) through (7) inclusive, during the relevant time periods, and we intend to continue to be organized and operate in this manner. However, qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, including through actual operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be organized or will be able to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. \nIf we lose our status as a REIT (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders for each of the years involved because:\n•We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax;\n•We could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and\n•Unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified.\nIn addition, in such event we would no longer be required to pay dividends to maintain REIT status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. See “Risk Factors—Our REIT Status Risks.”\nOur senior housing communities, including certain of our independent living communities, that are considered “qualified healthcare properties” that are not leased to a third party operator generally must be owned and operated in a structure where we engage a third-party manager to manage and operate the senior housing communities. For these senior housing communities we are required to rely on a third-party manager to manage and operate the property, including for purposes of procuring supplies, hiring and training all employees, entering into all third-party contracts for the benefit of the property, including resident/patient agreements, complying with laws and regulations, including but not limited to healthcare laws, and providing resident care and services, in exchange for a management fee. We treat most of the senior housing communities in our SHOP segment as qualified healthcare properties that must be operated by third-party managers. \nEnvironmental Regulation\nA wide variety of federal, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect our assets. These complex federal, local and foreign statutes, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which impose strict liability on offenders. Some of these federal, local and foreign laws and regulations may directly impact us. Under various federal, local and foreign environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property or a secured lender, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property).\nWith respect to our properties that are operated by third parties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and cleanup of any property from which there is or has been an actual or threatened release of a regulated material and any other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. Such costs typically are not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value. In addition, we may be liable for certain other costs, such as governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources, as a result of any such actual or threatened release. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy—Our operating assets may expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nUnder the terms of our leases and loans, we generally have a right to indemnification by the tenants of our properties or borrowers for any contamination caused by them.\nIn some instances, we have agreed to indemnify our managers and tenants against any environmental claims (including penalties and cleanup costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or relating to, the applicable properties at any time before the applicable lease or management commencement date. With respect to SHOP, we have agreed to indemnify our managers against any environmental claims (including penalties and cleanup costs) resulting from any condition on those properties.",

      "text": "ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors\nThis section discusses material factors that affect our business, operations and financial condition. It does not describe all risks and uncertainties applicable to us, our industry or ownership of our securities. If any of the following risks, or any other risks and uncertainties that are not addressed below or that we have not yet identified, actually occur, we could be materially adversely affected, and the value of our securities could decline.\nAs set forth below, we believe that the risks we face generally fall into the following categories:\n•Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy\n•Our Capital Structure Risks \n•Our Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\n•Our REIT Status Risks\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Strategy\nMacroeconomic trends, including trends relating to labor costs, unemployment, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates, may affect our business and financial results.\nMacroeconomic trends, including unfavorable trends relating to labor costs, unemployment, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increased labor costs and a shortage of available skilled and unskilled workers may impact our or our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ workforce, including employees at our senior housing communities. To the extent we or our managers, tenants or borrowers cannot hire sufficient qualified workers, we or they may need to rely on high-cost alternatives to meet labor needs, including contract and overtime labor. In addition, we and our managers, tenants and borrowers compete with various other companies in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel. Competitive pressures may require that we or our managers, tenants or borrowers enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel. We and our managers, tenants and borrowers may not be able to offset additional staffing costs by increasing the rates we charge, whether to residents, tenants or others. If there is an increase in these costs or if we or our managers, tenants and borrowers fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel, our respective businesses and operating results could be adversely affected.\nMany of our costs and the costs of our managers, tenants and borrowers, including operating and administrative expenses, interest expense and real estate acquisition and construction costs, are subject to inflation. These include expenses for property-related contracted services, utilities, repairs and maintenance and insurance and general and administrative costs including compensation costs, technology services and professional service fees. See also “—We may face increased risks and costs associated with volatility in materials and labor prices or as a result of supply chain or procurement disruptions, which may adversely affect the status of our construction projects.” Property taxes are also impacted by inflationary changes because taxes in some jurisdictions are regularly reassessed based on changes in the fair value of our properties. We may not be able to offset such additional costs by passing them through, or increasing the rates we charge, to residents and tenants. If there is an increase in these costs, our business, cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected.\nRising interest rates may also result in higher operating and incremental borrowing costs for us and our managers, tenants and borrowers. Increases in or elevated interest rates may also result in a decrease in the value of our real estate and a decrease in our cash flows and net income. See “—We are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective.”\nElevated inflation or higher than expected interest rates due to macrodevelopments, U.S. government policies, or otherwise, could negatively impact consumer spending, our and our managers’, tenants’ and borrowers’ businesses, and future demand for our properties. See also “—Market conditions and the actual and perceived state of the capital markets generally could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations”, “—If our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ financial condition or business prospects deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.”\nChanges in the U.S. political and regulatory environment could affect availability of government funding that we or our managers, tenants or borrowers rely on, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe and our managers, tenants and borrowers may rely on government programs or agencies as a source of funding. Our tenants include universities, academic medical centers and other research institutions whose funding may be dependent on grants from government agencies, such as the NIH and similar agencies or organizations. Other of our tenants, such as LTACs, SNFs and certain healthcare facilities, may rely on reimbursement from Medicare and/or Medicaid. \nFunding from government agencies and reimbursement programs such as the NIH, Medicare and Medicaid, including the overall availability and reimbursement rates under these programs, often fluctuates and is subject to the political process, which is often unpredictable. For example, on February 7, 2025, the NIH issued Notice Number NOT-OD-25-068, a guidance document pronouncing that reimbursement for certain indirect costs would be capped at 15% for existing and future grant recipients, a rate that is lower than the in-place rate for many existing grant recipients. Certain of our tenants, including certain university tenants, may depend on NIH grants and reimbursements to partially fund research and in some cases to pay rent for space in our properties. In addition, federal policymakers have announced proposals to reduce overall healthcare spending, including with respect to Medicaid funding, which could impact our healthcare provider tenants and borrowers. \nAny reduction in the availability or rate of funding or reimbursement, or delays surrounding the approval of such funding or reimbursement, may adversely impact our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ operations or may cause our tenants to \ncease making rent payment payments to us or delay or forgo leasing space in our properties, which in turn may negatively impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, such developments could adversely impact the overall demand for space in our properties.\nEconomic conditions and other events or occurrences that affect areas in which our properties are geographically concentrated may impact financial results.\nWe are exposed to general economic conditions, local, regional, national and international economic conditions and other events and occurrences that affect the markets in which we own properties. Our operating performance is impacted by the economic conditions of the specific markets in which we have concentrations of properties and could be adversely affected if conditions become less favorable in any such markets. \nA substantial portion of our value is derived from properties in California, New York, Texas, Illinois and Quebec, Canada. As a result, we are subject to increased exposure to adverse conditions affecting these regions, including downturns in the local economies or changes in local real estate conditions, changing demographics, increased construction and competition or decreased demand for our properties, regional climate events, such as wildfires, earthquakes or storms, regional disruptions to, or limited availability of, utilities and other services and changes in the state and local legal and regulatory environment. Our inability to response to such condition, events or occurrences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nTo the extent that we or our managers, tenants and borrowers are unable to navigate successfully the trends affecting our or their businesses and the industries in which we or they operate, we may be adversely affected.\nOur managers, tenants and borrowers include senior housing managers, hospitals, post-acute facilities and other healthcare systems, medical practices and life sciences and technology companies that are subject to a complex set of trends affecting their businesses and the industries in which they operate. If we or they are unable to successfully navigate these trends, our business, financial condition and results and that of our managers, tenants and borrowers could be adversely affected. \nThere have been, and there are expected to continue to be, advances and changes in technology, payment models, healthcare delivery models, public policy, regulation and consumer behavior and perception that could reduce demand for on-site activities provided at our properties. For example, the increased demand in telehealth solutions could broadly impact market demand for our properties and cause long-term structural changes in the marketplace. If our managers, tenants or borrowers are unable to adapt to long-term changes in demand, their financial condition could be materially impacted and our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nOur managers, tenants and borrowers face a highly competitive labor market, which has been compounded by general inflationary pressures on wages and could be further compounded by a shortage of care givers or other trained personnel, union activities or minimum wage laws. For example, California SB-525, which was signed into law in June 2023 and became effective for healthcare workers in 2024, requires certain healthcare facility employers to pay wages for certain covered employees that are higher than other state-mandated minimum wages. Pressures such as these may require our managers, tenants and borrowers to comply with regulations or enhance pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for trained personnel or use high-cost alternatives to meet labor needs, including contract and overtime labor. They may be unable to offset these increased costs by increasing the amounts they charge their patients, residents or clients. Rising labor expense could negatively impact the financial condition of our managers, tenants and borrowers and impair their ability to meet their obligations to us.\nFederal policymakers have announced proposals that may result in significant changes to the healthcare system in the United States, including with respect to government funding of or from NIH and Medicaid, which could impact certain of our managers, tenants and borrowers. See “—Changes in the U.S. political and regulatory environment could affect availability of government funding that we or our managers, tenants or borrowers rely on, which could negatively impact our business.” These and other trends could significantly and adversely affect the profitability of these tenants, which could affect their ability to make payments or meet their other obligations to us or their willingness to renew their leases on terms that are as favorable to us, or at all.\nWe are vulnerable to adverse changes affecting our specific asset classes and the real estate industry generally. \nWe invest in a variety of asset classes in real estate, including senior housing, outpatient medical, research, long-term acute care facilities and other healthcare facilities. While we endeavor to invest in a diversified portfolio, there can be no \nassurance that in a particular economic or operational environment all assets will perform equally well or that our balance sheet will be appropriately balanced. Each of our asset classes are subject to their own dynamics and their own specific operational, financial, compliance, regulatory and market risks.\nA broad downturn or slowdown in the healthcare real estate sector could have a greater adverse impact on our business than if we had investments in multiple industries and could negatively impact the ability of our managers, tenants and borrowers to meet their obligations to us. A downturn or slowdown in any one of our asset classes could adversely affect the value of our properties in such asset class and our ability to sell such properties at prices or on terms acceptable or favorable to us if at all. \nWe are exposed to the risks inherent in investments in real estate. Real estate investments are relatively illiquid, and our ability to quickly sell or exchange our properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions is limited. If we market any of our properties for sale, the value of those properties and our ability to sell at prices or on terms acceptable to us could be adversely affected by a downturn in the real estate industry. Transfers of healthcare real estate may be subject to regulatory approvals that are not required for transfers of other types of commercial real estate. We cannot assure you that we will recognize the full value of any property that we sell, and the inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur third-party managers and tenants operate or exert substantial control over the properties that they manage for or rent from us, which limits our control and influence over operations and results.\nA significant portion of our properties are either managed for us by third-party managers or leased from us by third-party tenants. Our third-party managers and tenants are ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the properties that they manage for or lease from us. We have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of those properties, even though we have approval rights with respect to certain matters and the right to review operational and financial reporting information with respect to a majority of our portfolio. Although we may have the right under specified circumstances to terminate our arrangements with these third parties or pursue other remedies, we either may not be able to enforce these rights or may choose not to enforce these rights if we believe that enforcement would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches. We depend on these third parties to operate these properties in a manner that complies with applicable law and regulation, minimizes legal risk and maximizes the value of our investment. These third parties may have business interests, goals and competing interests which conflict with ours that could create a conflict of interest. Additionally, new or smaller third-party managers may have less experience and require more oversight or attention. The failure by these third parties to operate these properties efficiently and effectively and adequately manage the related risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nOur operating assets may expose us to various operational risks, liabilities and claims that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues or increase our costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nUnder the REIT tax rules, the senior housing communities in our SHOP segment that are “qualified healthcare properties” generally must be operated and managed for us by third-party managers and we have limited rights to direct or influence the business or operations of those communities. A number of the non-qualified healthcare properties in our SHOP segment are also managed by third-party managers. However, in each case, we nonetheless participate directly in the financial performance of the communities’ operations and are ultimately responsible for all operational risks and other liabilities of such properties, other than those arising out of certain actions by our managers, such as gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. These risks include, and our financial performance is impacted by, among other things, fluctuations in occupancy levels, the inability to charge desirable resident fees (including anticipated increases in those fees), increases in the cost of food, supplies, energy, labor (as a result of labor shortages, unionization, inflation or otherwise) or other services, rent control regulations, national and regional economic conditions, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, changes in management or equity, accounting misstatements, professional and general liability claims, litigation and regulatory actions and the availability and cost of insurance. Any one or a combination of these factors could impact the performance of our SHOP segment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such risks could also arise as a result of our ownership of outpatient medical and research buildings, and which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generally hold the applicable healthcare license and enroll in applicable government healthcare programs on behalf of the properties in our SHOP segment, which subjects us to potential liability under various healthcare laws and regulations. See “—We and our managers, tenants and borrowers may be adversely affected by regulation and enforcement.”\nA significant portion of our revenues and operating income is dependent on a limited number of managers and tenants, including Atria, Sunrise, Le Groupe Maurice, Brookdale, Ardent and Kindred.\nThe portfolios managed or leased by Atria, Sunrise, Le Groupe Maurice, Brookdale, Ardent and Kindred represent a substantial portion of our portfolio and account for a significant portion of our revenues and NOI. \nWe rely on Atria, Sunrise and Le Groupe Maurice to manage a significant portion of the properties in our SHOP segment, including by setting appropriate resident fees, managing expenses, providing accurate property-level financial results in a timely manner and otherwise managing risk and operating our senior housing communities profitably and in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable law and regulation. Any adverse developments in such managers’ business and affairs or financial condition could impair their ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could adversely affect the financial performance of our properties and our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Atria, Sunrise or Le Groupe Maurice experience financial, legal, accounting, regulatory or other difficulties that impact their financial stability or ability to operate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. \nWe depend on Brookdale, Ardent and Kindred to pay all property-related expenses, including maintenance, utilities, repairs, taxes, insurance and capital expenditures, and to comply with the terms of the mortgage financing, if any, affecting the properties they lease from us. These tenants have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. We cannot assure you that they will be able to, or will continue to, satisfy their obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by them to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure by any one of Brookdale, Ardent or Kindred to effectively conduct its operations or to maintain and improve the properties they lease from us could adversely affect their financial condition and, in turn, our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nIf we need to replace any of our managers or tenants, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, if at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur leases and management agreements have set terms. While our leases and management agreements may be renewed, either pursuant to prenegotiated renewal rights or through negotiation, there can be no assurance that our tenants will renew their leases with us, or our managers will renew their management agreements with us. Even if a tenant renews its lease with us, or a manager renews its management agreement with us, we cannot assure you that the renewals will be on favorable terms. This risk may be exacerbated if market conditions at the time of the renewal are not as favorable as they were at the time the lease or management agreement was initially entered into or if the manager or tenant is subject to financial or operational difficulties.\nOur leases and management agreements provide us, our managers and our tenants with termination rights in certain circumstances. If our leases or management agreements are not renewed or are otherwise terminated, we may attempt to reposition those properties with one or more managers or tenants, as applicable, or for an alternative use. We may not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or entering into leases, management agreements or other arrangements with new managers or tenants on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases or management agreements, if at all. We may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (such as real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) or provide certain indemnities to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. \nIf our leases or management agreements are not renewed or are otherwise terminated at some properties, we may attempt to sell those properties. We may not be successful in identifying suitable buyers or entering into sale agreements with buyers on a timely basis or on favorable terms, if at all, and we may be required to fund some expenses and obligations (such as real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being sold.\nDuring transition periods to new managers or tenants or as a result of a repositioning for an alternative use, the attention of existing managers or tenants may be diverted from the performance of the properties, which could cause the financial and operational performance at those properties to decline. Our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement manager or tenant or for an alternative use could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, certificates of need, Medicaid change-of-ownership rules or other legal and regulatory requirements or restrictions. We could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. \nIn the case of our leased properties, following expiration of a lease term, or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant in default, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we attempt to reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant or for an alternative use. This risk could be exacerbated by laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions that limit our ability to take remedial action against defaulted tenants under certain circumstances. Market conditions in effect at the time of the expiration or default of a lease may require us to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain tenants or obtain new suitable replacement tenants. Our ability to locate and attract suitable replacement tenants could be impaired by the specialized healthcare use or contractual restrictions on use of the property, and we may be forced to spend substantial amounts to adapt the properties to other uses.\nIf our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ financial condition or business prospects deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely heavily on our managers, tenants and borrowers and their ability to perform their obligations to us, regardless of whether our relationship is structured as a lease, as a management contract or as a loan. Any of our managers, tenants or borrowers may experience a weakening in their overall financial or operating condition, including as a result of deteriorating operating performance, changes in industry or market conditions, such as supply-demand dynamics, rising or elevated labor costs, interest rates or inflation, or other factors. If their financial condition deteriorates, they may be unable or unwilling to make payments or perform their obligations to us in a timely manner, if at all. Although we may have the right under specified circumstances to terminate a lease, evict a tenant, terminate our management agreements, demand immediate repayment of outstanding loan amounts or pursue other remedies, we may not be able to enforce these rights, or we may determine it is not prudent to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.\nIn some cases, our managers, tenants and borrowers rely on reimbursements from governmental programs for a portion of their revenues. Changes in reimbursement policies and other governmental regulation resulting from actions by the U.S. Congress, U.S. executive orders or other governmental or regulatory agencies may result in reductions in our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ revenues, operations and cash flows and affect our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ ability to meet their obligations to us. Failure to comply with reimbursement regulations or other laws applicable to healthcare providers could result in penalties, fines, litigation costs, lost revenue or other consequences, which could adversely impact our tenants’ ability to make contractual rent payments to us or adversely impact our cash flows from operations under a management arrangement. Our managers, tenants and borrowers who operate senior housing communities often depend on private pay sources consisting of the income or assets of residents or their family members to pay fees. Costs associated with independent and assisted living services generally are not reimbursable under government reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. \nOur managers, tenants and borrowers depend on their ability to attract seniors, patients and other users of their services to their businesses, which may be affected by many factors, including, among other factors: (i) prevailing economic conditions and market trends, including market volatility, inflation and the strength of the economy generally and the housing market in particular; (ii) the ability to pay for such services, either through private resources or government reimbursement programs; (iii) consumer confidence; (iv) demographics; (v) property conditions; (vi) clinical conditions and safety, including as a result of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness, such as that seen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic; (vi) public perception about such healthcare services; and (vii) social and environmental factors. \nIf our managers, tenants or borrowers fail to effectively conduct their operations, or to maintain and improve our properties on our behalf, it could adversely affect (i) their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our and our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ business, financial condition or results of operations and (ii) our business reputation as the owner of the properties and the business reputation of our managers, tenants or borrowers. Further, if a manager, tenant or borrower defaults or fails to pay its outstanding obligations at a time when terminating our agreement with, or replacing, such manager, tenant or borrower may be extremely difficult or impossible, we may elect instead to amend such agreement, which may be on terms that are less favorable to us than the original agreements and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of our managers, tenants, borrowers and other obligors.\nWe lease a significant number of our properties to tenants, operate a significant number of our properties through third-party managers and provide financing to third-party borrowers. We have limited control over the success or failure of our managers’, tenants’ and borrowers’ businesses, and, at any time, a manager, tenant or borrower may experience a downturn in \nits business that weakens its financial condition. If that happens, the manager, tenant or borrower may fail to make payments or meet its other obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. \nA downturn in any one of our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ businesses could ultimately lead to its bankruptcy if it is unable to timely resolve the underlying causes, which may be largely outside of its control. Bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization that may render certain of our rights and remedies unenforceable or delay our ability to pursue such rights and remedies and realize any recoveries. For example, we cannot evict a tenant solely because it has filed a bankruptcy petition. A debtor-lessee may reject our lease in a bankruptcy proceeding, and any claim we have for unpaid rent might not be paid in full. We may be unable to exercise available termination rights under our management contracts during the pendency of any bankruptcy petition. We also may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (such as real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of our properties, avoid the imposition of liens on our properties or transition our properties to a new manager or tenant.\nBankruptcy or insolvency proceedings may result in increased costs and require significant management attention and resources. If we are unable to transition affected properties efficiently and effectively, such properties could experience prolonged operational disruption, leading to lower occupancy rates and further depressed revenues. Publicity about a manager’s, tenant’s or borrower’s financial condition and insolvency proceedings may negatively impact its reputation, which could result in decreased customer demand and revenues. Any or all of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks would be magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single third party, as a failure or default would expose us to these risks across multiple properties. \nSee also “—If a borrower defaults, we may be unable to obtain payment, successfully foreclose on collateral or realize the value of any collateral, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investment” below.\nThe hospitals on or near the campuses where our outpatient medical buildings are located and their affiliated health systems may not remain competitive or financially viable.\nOur outpatient medical buildings and other properties that serve the healthcare industry depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near the campuses where our properties are located or that our properties are otherwise affiliated with, and their ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients to our properties. The viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on a solid quality and mix of healthcare services provided, successful competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, positive demographic trends in the surrounding community, positive macroeconomic conditions, superior market position and growth potential as well as the ability of the affiliated health systems to provide economies of scale and access to capital. If a hospital on or near the campus where one of our properties is located fails or becomes unable to meet its financial obligations, and if an affiliated health system is unable to support that hospital, that hospital may be unable to compete successfully. That could adversely impact the hospital’s ability to attract physicians and other healthcare-related clients, and, in some cases, the hospital might even close or relocate. We rely on proximity to and affiliations with hospitals to create leasing demand in our outpatient medical buildings and similar properties. If a hospital moves, closes, doesn’t remain competitive or financially viable or can’t attract physicians and physician groups, our properties and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur research tenants face unique levels of expense and uncertainty. \nOur research tenants develop and sell products and services in an industry that is characterized by rapid and significant changes, evolving industry standards, significant research and development risk, in some cases, and uncertainty over the implementation of new healthcare reform or medical device legislation. These tenants, particularly those involved in developing and marketing pharmaceutical or other life science products, require significant outlays of funds for the research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and commercialization of their products and technologies, as well as to fund their other obligations, including rent payments to us. Our tenants’ ability to raise capital depends on the timely success of their research and development activities, viability of their products and technologies, their financial and operating condition and outlook and the overall financial, economic and legal and regulatory environment. If private investors, the federal government, universities, public markets or other sources of funding are unwilling or unable to fund these tenants because of general economic conditions, adverse market conditions or otherwise, a tenant may not be able to pay rent or meet its other obligations to us and its business may fail. The financing market and availability of government funding for research companies has been and may continue to be volatile, which may contribute to these risks. See “—Changes in the U.S. political and regulatory environment could affect availability of government funding that we or our managers, tenants or borrowers rely on, which could negatively impact our business.”\nThe research and development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of some of our tenants’ products require federal, state and foreign regulatory approvals. The approval process is typically long, expensive and uncertain. Even if our tenants have sufficient funds to seek approvals, one or all of their products may fail to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. Our tenants may only have a small number of products under development. If one product fails to receive the required approvals at any stage of development, it could significantly and adversely affect the tenant’s entire business. Our tenants may be unable to manufacture their products successfully or economically, may be unable to adapt to rapid technological advances in their industry, may be unable to adequately obtain, maintain, enforce, defend, protect or commercialize their intellectual property, may face competition from new products or may not receive acceptance of their products. If our research tenants’ business deteriorates for these or any other reasons, they may be unable to make payments or meet their other obligations to us.\nWe cannot assure you that any of our research tenants will be successful in their businesses. Any tenant that is unable to avoid, or sufficiently mitigate, the risks described above may have difficulty making payments or satisfying its other obligations to us, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “—If we need to replace any of our managers or tenants, we may be unable to do so on as favorable terms, if at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”\nIf a borrower defaults, we may be unable to obtain payment, successfully foreclose on collateral or realize the value of any collateral, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investment.\nIf a borrower defaults under a mortgage or other loan for which we are the lender, we may attempt to obtain payment in full or foreclose on the collateral securing the loan, including by acquiring any pledged equity interests or acquiring title to the subject properties, to protect our investment. The defaulting borrower may not be able to repay us even if we are legally entitled to full repayment of the debt. The defaulting borrower may contest our enforcement of foreclosure or other available remedies, seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other available remedies or bring claims against us for lender liability. Any such delay or limit on our ability to pursue our rights or remedies could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—We face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of our managers, tenants, borrowers and other obligors.”\nAlthough our loan agreements give us the right to exercise, under certain circumstances, certain remedies in the event of a default on the obligations owing to us, we may decide not to exercise those remedies for one or more reasons. For example, we may not exercise remedies (or be successful in exercising remedies) if the terms are not enforceable, if the terms are too costly to enforce or if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches. We may also decide not to enforce other contractual protections, such as annual rent escalators, or the properties may not generate sufficient revenue to achieve the specified rent escalation parameters.\nEven if we successfully foreclose on any collateral securing our mortgages and other loans, costs related to enforcement of our remedies, high loan-to-value ratios or declines in the value of the collateral could prevent us from realizing the full amount of our investment and we could be required to record a reserve or valuation allowance with respect to such loans. The collateral securing our mortgages and other loans may include equity interests in an entity with unexpected liabilities that limits the value of those equity interests, or the equity interests may be subject to securities law restrictions that limit our ability to sell those interests in a timely manner, if at all. The mortgages and other loans we hold may have other limiting characteristics that result in us not having full recourse to the collateral securing those obligations or may limit our flexibility if we foreclose on the collateral. In connection with any foreclosure on any loan, we may be required to assume, replace or otherwise incur indebtedness, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition. We may be unable to reposition any real property included in acquired collateral on a timely basis, if at all, or without making significant improvements or repairs. Any delay or costs incurred in selling or repositioning acquired collateral could adversely affect our ability to recover the full amount of our investment. \nOur ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon identifying and consummating future acquisitions and investments and effectively managing our expansion opportunities.\nOur ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon identifying and consummating future acquisitions and investments and effectively managing our expansion opportunities. Our ability to execute this strategy successfully is affected by many factors, including the significant competition we face for acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities, the availability of suitable opportunities, our relationships with current and prospective clients and partners, our ability to obtain debt and equity capital at costs comparable to or better than our competitors and lower than the yield we earn on our acquisitions or investments and our ability to negotiate favorable terms with counterparties, including buyers and sellers of \nassets. We compete for these opportunities with a broad variety of potential investors, including other healthcare REITs, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have advantages compared to us, including greater financial resources and lower costs of capital. See “Business—Competition” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. If we are unsuccessful at identifying and capitalizing on investment, acquisition, development and redevelopment opportunities and otherwise expanding and diversifying our portfolio, our growth and profitability may be adversely affected. \nWhen expanding into areas that are new to us, we face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with (i) the required investment of capital and other resources; (ii) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk; (iii) the diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses; (iv) the increasing demands on or issues related to operational and management systems and controls; (v) compliance with additional legal or regulatory requirements with which we are not familiar; and (vi) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Any new strategies, markets or businesses that we enter into may not be successful or meet our expectations, or we may be unable to effectively monitor or manage our portfolio of properties as it expands. Failure to meet any of these objectives could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in and acquisitions of properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make significant acquisitions and investments as part of our overall business strategy. Investing in and acquiring healthcare real estate entails risks associated with real estate investments generally, including the risk that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that a manager, tenant or borrower will fail to meet performance expectations or their obligations to us. We also make acquisitions and investments outside the United States, which raises legal, economic and market risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, such as currency exchange fluctuations and foreign tax risks.\nOur real estate development and redevelopment projects present additional risks, including the risk of construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses, the inability to obtain required zoning, occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis and the incurrence of significant costs prior to completion of the project. Healthcare real estate properties are often highly customized, and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific or market-driven improvements. \nOther risks that our significant acquisition and investment activity, including our developments and redevelopments, presents include that:\n•We may be unable to successfully integrate the operations, personnel or systems of acquired companies, maintain consistent standards, controls, policies and procedures, retain key personnel or companies we acquire or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other investments within the anticipated time frame if at all;\n•Our underwriting assumptions, including projections of estimated future revenues and expenses and anticipated synergies and other costs savings, and other financial and operating metrics that we develop may be inaccurate, in which case we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition, investment, development or redevelopment;\n•Our leverage could increase or our per share financial results could decline if we incur additional debt or issue equity securities to finance acquisitions and investments;\n•Acquisitions and investments could divert management’s attention from our existing assets; \n•The value of the assets we acquire or invest in may decline or we may not realize the expected return on the developments or redevelopments we undertake; and\n•If our acquisitions, investments, developments and redevelopments are not successful, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nSee also “—Our ongoing strategy depends, in part, upon identifying and consummating future acquisitions and investments and effectively managing our expansion opportunities.”\nWe cannot assure you that our acquisitions, investments, developments and redevelopments will be successful or meet our expectations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in co-investment vehicles, joint ventures and minority interests may subject us to risks and liabilities that we would not otherwise face.\nWe have and may continue to develop and acquire properties in co-investment vehicles or joint ventures with other persons or entities when circumstances warrant the use of these structures.  In 2020, we formed Ventas Investment Management (“VIM”) to combine our private capital management capabilities for certain assets under a single platform. We also own minority investments in properties and unconsolidated operating entities. These minority investments usually entitle us to typical rights and protections but inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations than if we owned a majority interest. In the future, we may enter into additional co-investments, partnerships and joint ventures, either through VIM or otherwise. \nThere can be no assurance that our co-investments, joint ventures, minority or other investments, which we refer to collectively below as investments and ventures, will be successful or meet our expectations. These investments and ventures involve significant risk, including, among others, the following:\n•We may be unable to take actions that are opposed by our partners under arrangements that require us to share decision-making authority;\n•For investments and ventures in which we have a noncontrolling interest, our partners may take actions that we oppose;\n•If our partners become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fulfill other partner obligations, we may choose to or be required to contribute that capital;\n•Our partners may seek to redeem their investment, and may do so simultaneously, causing the venture to seek capital to satisfy these requests on less than optimal terms; \n•Some of our investments and ventures may incur indebtedness; in some cases, we may guarantee the payment of such indebtedness, in whole or in part; depending on credit market conditions, the refinancing or payoff of such indebtedness may require equity capital calls, which we or our partners may not be capable of funding or which may be required at inopportune times;\n•We may be subject to restrictions on our ability to transfer our interest in the investment or venture, which may require us to retain our interest at a time when we would otherwise prefer to sell it; \n•Our partners may have business interests or goals that conflict with our business interests and goals, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments, and what levels of financing to incur or carry;\n•Our partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes and this could create conflicts of interest, including with respect to our compliance with the REIT requirements, and our REIT status could be jeopardized if any of our joint ventures do not operate in compliance with REIT requirements;\n•Our investments or ventures or our partners may be unable to meet their financial or other obligations to us or to the investment or venture, including any obligation to provide equity to the investment or venture or indemnify us or the investment or venture for losses;\n•Our partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest;\n•We could experience an impasse on certain decisions where we do not have sole decision-making authority, which could require us to expend additional resources on resolving such impasses or potential disputes;\n•We could become engaged in a dispute with any of our partners that could lead to the sale of either parties’ ownership interest or the underlying assets;\n•Disagreements with our partners could result in litigation or arbitration; and\n•We may suffer other losses as a result of actions taken by our partners. \nIn some instances, our partners may have the right to cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner’s interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest will be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. This may require us to sell our interest in the investment or venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. \nIn certain circumstances, Ventas serves as managing member, general partner or controlling party with respect to investments and ventures, including within our VIM platform. In such instances, we may face additional risks including, among others, the following:\n•Ventas may have increased duties to the other investors or partners in the investment or venture;\n•In the event of certain events or conflicts, our partners may have recourse against Ventas, including the right to monetary penalties, the ability to force a sale or exit the investment or venture;\n•Our partners may have the right to remove us as the general partner or managing member in certain cases involving cause; and\n•Our subsidiaries that would be the general partner or managing member of the investment or venture could be generally liable, under applicable law or the governing agreement of a venture, for the debts and obligations of the investment or venture, subject to certain exculpation and indemnification rights pursuant to the terms of the governing agreement.\nIncreased construction and development in the markets in which our properties are located could adversely affect our future occupancy rates, operating margins and profitability.\nIf existing supply and development collectively outpaces demand in the markets in which our properties are located, those markets may become saturated and we could experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Depending on the jurisdiction, there are limited barriers to developing properties in our asset classes, particularly senior housing. As a result, supply and demand dynamics can change quickly. We may be unable to rebalance our portfolio in a timely manner in order to respond to changes in those dynamics.\nMerger, acquisition and investment activity in our industries resulting in a change of control of, or a competitor’s investment in, one or more of our managers, tenants or borrowers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe senior housing and healthcare industries have experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, including among owners of real estate, managers, tenants borrowers and care providers. When a change of control of a managers, tenant or borrower occurs, that manager’s, tenant’s or borrower’s strategy, financial condition, management team or real estate needs may change, any of which could adversely affect our relationship with that party and our revenues and results of operations. If any of our managers or tenants merge with one another, our dependence on a small group of significant third parties would increase, as would our exposure to the risks described above under “—Our investments in and acquisitions of properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations.” A competitor’s investment in one of our managers, tenants or borrowers could enable our competitor to directly or indirectly influence that manager’s, tenant’s or borrower’s business and strategy in a manner that impairs our relationship with the manager, tenant or borrower or is otherwise adverse to our interests. Depending on our contractual agreements and the specific facts and circumstances, we may not have the right to prevent a competitor’s investment in, a change of control of, or other transactions impacting a manager, tenant or borrower.\nDevelopment, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability.\nWe invest in various development and redevelopment projects. In deciding whether to make an investment in a project, we make certain underwriting assumptions regarding expected future performance. Our assumptions are subject to risks generally associated with development and redevelopment projects, including, among others, that:\n•Tenants may not lease the amount of space projected or at the projected rental rate levels or lease on the projected schedule, including due to increased competition in the market and other market and economic conditions;\n•Our underwriting assumptions and other financial and operating metrics that we develop, such as the estimated costs necessary to develop or redevelop the property, may be inaccurate, in which case we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the project;\n•We may not complete the project on schedule or within budgeted amounts;\n•We may not be able to recognize rental revenue even though cash rent is being paid and the lease has commenced;\n•We may encounter delays in obtaining or we may fail to obtain necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy, environmental and other governmental permits and authorizations; \n•We may be unable to obtain financing for the project on favorable terms or at all, including at the maturity of an applicable construction loan;\n•Construction or other delays may provide tenants or residents the right to terminate preconstruction leases or cause us to incur additional costs, including through rent abatement;\n•Volatility in the price of construction materials or labor may increase our project costs;\n•Any partners in the project may maintain significant decision-making authority with respect to the project, which lessens our control and could lead to increased costs, project delays or disputes;\n•Our builders or development managers may fail to meet their obligations to us or satisfy the expectations of our tenants and partners; and\n•We may incorrectly forecast risks associated with development in new geographic regions or addressing markets that are new to us, including new markets where we may not have sufficient depth of market knowledge.\nWe may face increased risks and costs associated with volatility in materials and labor prices or as a result of supply chain or procurement disruptions, which may adversely affect the status of our construction projects.\nThe price of materials and labor for our construction projects may increase due to external factors, including but not limited to performance of third-party suppliers and contractors, overall market supply and demand, elevated or increasing interest rates, government regulation and policies, including actions taken by the Federal Reserve, and changes in general business, economic or political conditions. As a result, the costs of construction materials and skilled labor required for the completion of our development and redevelopment projects may fluctuate significantly over time.\nWe rely on a number of third-party suppliers and contractors to supply materials and labor for our construction projects. We may experience difficulties obtaining necessary materials from suppliers or vendors whose supply chains might be disrupted by macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, or difficulties obtaining adequate labor from third-party contractors . If we are unable to access materials and labor to complete our construction projects within our expected budgets and meet our or our development partners’ and tenants’ demands and expectations in a timely and efficient manner, our results of operations may be adversely impacted. We may be unable to complete our development or redevelopment projects timely or within our budget, which may affect our ability to lease space to potential tenants and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any of the risks described above occur, our development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. The loss of any one of our key personnel or the inability to maintain appropriate staffing could adversely impact our business.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key employees and the ability to maintain appropriate staffing levels across our organization. Failure to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees, or failure to develop, implement and maintain viable succession plans, could result in loss of institutional knowledge and important skill sets negatively impact our culture, significantly impacting our performance and adversely affecting our business. \nCompetition for talented employees is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will retain our employees or that we will be able to attract and retain other highly qualified individuals in the future. If our long-term compensation and retention plans and succession plans are not effective, if we lose any one or more of our key officers and employees or are unable to maintain appropriate staffing or operate below capacity – causing us to forego potential revenue and growth opportunities and affecting our ability to effectively manage risk – our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be required to recognize reserves, allowances, credit losses or impairment charges.\nDeclines in the value of our properties or other assets or loan collateral, financial deterioration of our borrowers or other obligors or other factors may result in the recognition of reserves, allowances, credit losses or impairment charges. Our determination of such reserves, allowances or credit losses relies on estimates regarding the fair value of any loan collateral, which is a complex and subjective process. In addition, we evaluate our assets for impairments based on various triggers, including market conditions, our current intentions with respect to holding or disposing of the assets and the expected future undiscounted cash flows from the assets. Impairments, reserves, allowances and credit losses are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, may increase or decrease in the future and may not represent or reflect the ultimate value of, or loss that we ultimately realize with respect to, the relevant assets. Any such impairment, reserve, allowance or credit loss, or any change in any of the foregoing, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. \nSee also “—If a borrower defaults, we may be unable to obtain payment, successfully foreclose on collateral or realize the value of any collateral, which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investment” and “—We face potential adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of our managers, tenants, borrowers and other obligors.”\nWe own properties that are subject to ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements that limit our uses of the properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer the properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated.\nOur investments in outpatient medical buildings and research buildings and facilities as well as other properties may be made through leasehold interests in the land on which the buildings are located, leases of air rights for the space above the land on which the buildings are located, or other similar restrictive arrangements. Many of these ground lease, air rights and other restrictive agreements impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. We could lose our interests in the subject properties if the ground lease, air rights or other restrictive agreements are breached by us, are terminated or expire. In addition, we could be forced to renegotiate such ground leases upon their expiration on terms that are unfavorable to us.\nPurchase options, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal in favor of third parties could negatively affect us or discourage prospective buyers from negotiating with us with respect to the sale of our properties.\nSome of our properties are subject to purchase options, rights of first offer, rights of first refusal or similar rights in favor of third parties. Purchase options for our properties may give a third party the right to purchase the property at fair market value, at a price set based on our investment in the property, or at fixed prices as of certain dates. The proceeds we receive as a result of the exercise of a purchase option may be less than the price we paid for the property, and we may not be able to re-invest the proceeds on favorable terms or at all. In addition, purchase options could force us to sell a property when we would otherwise prefer to hold such property. Purchase options, rights of first offer or rights of first refusal that encumber our properties could discourage prospective buyers from negotiating with us and may prevent us from receiving the maximum price that we may otherwise have obtained.\nDamage from catastrophic or extreme weather and other natural events and the physical effects of climate change could result in losses to the Company.\nSome of our properties are in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by catastrophic or extreme weather and other natural events, including fires, snow, rain or ice storms, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding and other severe weather. These adverse weather and natural events could cause substantial damages or losses to our properties that could exceed our or our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ property insurance coverage. \nAny of these events could cause a major power outage, leading to a disruption of our systems and operations. If we incur a loss greater than insured limits, or if for any reason insurance coverage is unavailable, we could lose our capital invested in the affected property, as well as anticipated future revenue from that property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change may increase the cost of property insurance on terms we find acceptable or make such insurance unavailable.\nIf significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our properties are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Where climate change has a significant or sustained impact, our properties could be destroyed and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in federal, state or foreign legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.\nCybersecurity threats and incidents could disrupt our operations or the operations of the third parties with whom we do business, invest in or lend to, result in the loss of or unauthorized access to confidential or personal information or damage our or their business relationships and reputation.\nCybersecurity threats and incidents have been occurring globally at a more frequent and advanced level and will likely continue to increase in frequency and severity in the future. Our business and the businesses of our managers, tenants, borrowers, investments in unconsolidated entities, vendors, suppliers, service providers and other third parties with whom we do business rely on technology and are consequently subject to risk from cybersecurity threats and incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems and networks, to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential or personal information and other cybersecurity breaches. Such attempts can originate from a wide variety of sources, including organized crime, hackers, activists, insider threats, terrorists, nation-states, state-sponsored actors and others, any of which may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence. \nWhile we have implemented measures designed to help mitigate these threats for our business, these measures cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing a cybersecurity incident. Our information technology systems and networks are essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations of our business, and a cybersecurity threat or incident could result in a data center outage, disrupt our systems and operations, compromise the confidential or personal information of our employees, partners or the residents in our senior housing communities and damage our business relationships and reputation. Although we have implemented various measures designed to manage risks to our information technology systems and networks relating to these types of events, these measures could prove to be inadequate. If our information technology systems or networks are compromised, they could become inoperable for extended periods of time, cease to function properly or fail to adequately secure confidential and personal information, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to operate our business. \nCybersecurity threats and incidents, such as those involving software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failure, telecommunications failures, error or misconduct, ransomware, covertly introduced malware, denial-of-service attacks, impersonation of authorized users or other social engineering schemes (including phishing attacks), industrial or other espionage and other cybersecurity breaches may not be identified even with sophisticated prevention and detection systems, potentially resulting in further harm and preventing them from being addressed appropriately. The failure of our systems or of our disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in our operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information, material nonpublic information and intellectual property and trade secrets and other confidential or sensitive information we possess. \nWe do not control the information technology systems and network or cybersecurity measures put in place by our managers, tenants, borrowers, investments in unconsolidated entities, vendors, suppliers, service providers or other third parties with whom we do business, all of whom are subject to risks associated with cybersecurity threats and incidents. If those parties are unable to adequately manage those risks, their results of operations, financial condition and the viability of their business could be adversely affected, which could in turn have an adverse impact on us and our business. Any contractual protections with such third parties, such as indemnification obligations to us, if any at all, may be ineffective or otherwise inadequate.\nIn the event of a cybersecurity threat or incident involving us or our managers, tenants, borrowers, investments in unconsolidated entities, vendors, suppliers, service providers or other third parties with whom we do business, we and they may be required to make a significant investment to attempt to mitigate or remediate the effects of any cybersecurity threats incidents, and such efforts may not be successful. We and they may be subject to legal claims and regulatory or enforcement actions and may experience harm to our reputations and adverse publicity or suffer other adverse consequences. Further, we and they may not have adequate or any insurance coverage to cover any costs, expenses or other losses arising from any of the foregoing. In addition, we cannot be sure such insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all, or that the applicable insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. \nDamage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition or result of operations.\nOur positive reputation for quality and service with our key stakeholders, including our managers, tenants development partners, lenders and stockholders, could be damaged. Such damage to our reputation could result if, for example, we experience a sustained period of distress, either as a result of general market conditions or otherwise, where our properties underperform, our managers or tenants default or in other instances that result in misalignment with those parties. Damage to our reputation could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock or make it more difficult to maintain or expand our business relationships, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActivist investors could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management’s attention and have an adverse effect on our business.\nActivist investors have engaged, and may in the future engage, in proxy solicitations, advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to affect changes or acquire control over us. Responding to these actions can be costly and time-consuming, divert the attention of our Board and management from the management of our business and the pursuit of our business strategies. In addition to incurred costs, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our reputation and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.\nOur Capital Structure Risks\nMarket conditions and the actual and perceived state of the capital markets generally could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the capital markets and any disruption to the capital markets or our ability to access such markets could impair our ability to fulfill our dividend requirements, make payments to our security holders or otherwise finance our business operations. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world, including elevated or rising inflation, a general tightening of availability of credit (including the price, terms and conditions under which it can be obtained), the state of the public and private capital markets, decreased liquidity in certain financial markets, elevated or increased interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, low or declining consumer confidence, the actual or perceived state of the real estate market, tightened labor markets or significant declines in stock markets, as well as concerns regarding pandemics, epidemics and the spread of contagious diseases, could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, including recessions, economic slowdowns, high unemployment and rising prices or the perception by consumers of weak or weakening economic conditions may reduce disposable income and impact consumer spending in healthcare or senior housing, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nDuring inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased, which would have, and in recent periods has had, a direct effect on the interest expense and overall cost of our borrowings. The U.S. Federal Reserve may raise the federal funds rate, may maintain an elevated federal funds rate for longer than the market expects, or may not lower the federal funds rate consistent with market expectations. Any of these actions or failure to take action could result in higher than expected interest rates in the credit markets and the possibility of lower asset values, slowing economic growth or a recession. We are exposed to increases in or elevated interest rates in the short term through our variable-rate borrowings, which consist of borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, our unsecured term loans, our commercial paper program and certain other credit facilities. Therefore, interest rate increases or sustained elevated interest rates, due to inflation or otherwise, have in recent periods increased and may continue to increase our interest expense under these variable-rate facilities in the short term and increase our financing costs as we refinance our existing variable-rate and fixed-rate long-term borrowings, or incur additional interest expense related to the issuance of incremental debt in the long term.\nTo the extent there is turmoil in the global financial markets, this turmoil has the potential to adversely affect (i) the value of our properties; (ii) the availability or the terms of financing that we have or may be able to obtain; (iii) our ability to \nmake principal and interest payments on, or refinance when due, any outstanding indebtedness; (iv) our ability to pay a dividend; and (v) the ability of our managers, tenants and borrowers to satisfy their obligations to us. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may also adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nWe are exposed to increases in interest rates, which could reduce our profitability and adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt, sell assets or engage in acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity, and our decision to hedge against interest rate risk might not be effective.\nIncreases in or elevated interest rates may result in a decrease in the value of our real estate, a decrease in the market price of our common stock and a decrease in our cash flows and net income. Increases in or elevated interest rates may also adversely affect the securities markets generally, which could reduce the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. Any such unfavorable changes to our borrowing costs and price of our common stock could significantly impact our ability to raise new debt and equity capital going forward and increase the cost of financing on our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. An increase in or elevated interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our assets, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues by leasing assets under long-term triple-net leases that generally provide for fixed rental rates subject to annual escalations, while certain of our debt obligations are variable rate obligations with interest and related payments that vary with the movement of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), Bankers’ Acceptance or other indexes. The generally fixed rate nature of a significant portion of our revenues and the variable rate nature of certain of our debt obligations create interest rate risk. If interest rates continue to rise or remain elevated, the costs of our existing variable rate debt would increase or remain elevated and any new debt that we incur could increase. These increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, development and redevelopment activity. \nWe may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility with hedging arrangements that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. Moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $13.6 billion of outstanding principal indebtedness. The instruments governing our existing indebtedness permit us to incur substantial additional debt, including secured debt, and we may satisfy our capital and liquidity needs through additional borrowings. Our indebtedness requires us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the funds available to implement our business strategy and make distributions to stockholders. A high level of indebtedness on an absolute basis or as a ratio to our cash flow could also have the following consequences:\n•Potential limits on our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions and vulnerability in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or in the real estate or healthcare industries;\n•Potential impairment of our ability to obtain additional financing to execute on our business strategy; and\n•Potential downgrade in the rating of our debt securities by one or more rating agencies, which could have the effect of, among other things, limiting our access to capital and increasing our cost of borrowing.\nWe mortgage, and expect to continue to mortgage, certain of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness. If we are unable to meet our mortgage payments, then the encumbered properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee with a resulting loss of income and asset value.\nLimitations on our ability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on us, including our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy.\nWe are highly dependent on access to the debt and equity capital markets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to meet our debt service obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy if our cash flow from operations is insufficient to satisfy these needs. We cannot assure you that conditions in the capital markets will not deteriorate, that our access to capital and other sources of funding will not become constrained or that interest rates will not rise, any of which could adversely affect the availability and terms of future borrowings, renewals or refinancings and our results of operations and financial condition. If we cannot access capital at an acceptable cost or at all, we may be required to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit us to maximize the return on those investments or that could result in adverse tax consequences to us. \nAs a public company, our access to debt and equity capital depends, in part, on the trading prices of our senior notes and common stock, which, in turn, depend upon market conditions that change from time to time, such as the market’s perception of our financial condition, our growth potential and our current and expected future earnings and cash distributions. Our failure to meet the market’s expectation regarding future earnings and cash distributions or a significant downgrade in the ratings assigned to our long-term debt could impact our ability to access capital or increase our borrowing costs.\nWe rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. If these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOur ownership of properties in Canada and the United Kingdom currently subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars or the British pound, which may, from time to time, impact our financial condition and results of operations. If we continue to expand our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, assets outside the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom, we may transact business in other foreign currencies. Although we may pursue hedging alternatives, including borrowing in local currencies, to protect against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot assure you that such hedging will be successful and that fluctuations will not adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCovenants in the instruments governing our and our subsidiaries’ existing indebtedness limit our operational flexibility, and a covenant breach could adversely affect our operations.\nThe terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage, leverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. Our continued ability to incur additional debt and to conduct business in general is subject to our compliance with these covenants, which limit our operational flexibility. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the applicable debt instruments and could trigger defaults under any of our other indebtedness that is cross-defaulted against such instruments, even if we satisfy our payment obligations. Covenants contained in the instruments governing our subsidiaries’ outstanding mortgage indebtedness may restrict our ability to obtain cash distributions from such subsidiaries for the purpose of meeting our debt service obligations. Financial and other covenants that limit our operational flexibility, as well as defaults resulting from our breach of any of these covenants, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\nSignificant legal or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our managers, tenants or borrowers to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we or our managers, tenants or borrowers may be subject to lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our or their alleged actions or inactions. These claims may include, among other things, professional liability and general liability claims, commercial liability claims, unfair business practices claims, \nclass action claims, employment-related claims, as well as regulatory proceedings, including proceedings related to our SHOP segment, where we are typically the holder of the applicable healthcare license. In addition, some of our properties are in states in which the litigation environment may pose a significant business risk to us.\nIn our operating assets, including those in our SHOP and OM&R segments, we are generally responsible for all liabilities of the properties, including any lawsuits, investigations, claims and other legal or regulatory proceedings, other than those arising out of certain limited actions by our managers, such as those caused by gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct. As a result, we have exposure to, among other things, professional and general liability claims, employment-related claims and the associated litigation and other costs related to defending and resolving such claims, some of which may be uninsured, either as a result of insufficient coverage or unavailability of coverage at a reasonable price. \nIn our SHOP segment in particular, if one of our managers fails to comply with applicable law or regulation, we may be held responsible, which could subject us to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including the loss or suspension of accreditation, licenses or certificates of need with respect to a single community or more broadly; suspension of or nonpayment for new admissions; denial of reimbursement; fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal, state or foreign healthcare programs; or facility closure. In addition, we cannot assure you that any contractual obligations to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from such liabilities will be satisfied by third parties, or that any amounts held in escrow for such purpose will be sufficient.\nAn unfavorable resolution of any such lawsuit, investigation, claim or other legal or regulatory proceeding could materially and adversely affect our or our managers’, tenants’ or borrowers’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, and may not be protected by sufficient or any insurance coverage. Even with a favorable resolution of litigation or a proceeding, the effect of litigation and other potential litigation and proceedings may materially increase operating costs we or our managers, tenants or borrowers incur. Negative publicity with respect to any lawsuits, claims or other legal or regulatory proceedings may also negatively impact their or our or the affected properties’ reputation. \nOur business may be subject to lawsuits or other legal or regulatory proceedings such as professional or general liability litigation alleging wrongful death and negligence claims, some of which may result in large damage awards and not be indemnified or subject to sufficient insurance coverage, may require our support as a result of our indemnification agreements or may result in restrictions in the operations of our or our managers’ or tenants’ business.\nWe and our managers, tenants and borrowers may be adversely affected by regulation and enforcement.\nWe and our managers, tenants and borrowers are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. For example, the healthcare industry is subject to laws and regulations that relate to, among other things, licensure and certificates of need, conduct of operations, ownership of communities and facilities, construction of new communities and facilities and addition of equipment, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, allowable costs, services, prices for services, qualified beneficiaries, appropriateness and classification of care, patient rights, resident health and safety, data privacy and cybersecurity, wage and hour, fraud and abuse and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. We generally hold the applicable healthcare licenses and enroll in applicable government healthcare programs on behalf of the properties in our SHOP segment, and that subjects us to potential liability under some healthcare laws and regulations. See “Government Regulation—United States Healthcare Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. Many of our research tenants are subject to laws and regulations that govern the research, development, clinical testing, manufacture and marketing of drugs, medical devices and similar products. \nThe laws and regulations that apply to us and our managers, tenants and borrowers are complex and may change rapidly or new laws and regulations may be introduced, and efforts to comply with them require significant resources. Any new laws, regulations or changes in scope, interpretation or enforcement of the regulatory framework could require us or our managers, tenants or borrowers to make changes to our business or operations and invest significant resources in responding to these changes. For example, certain states have considered or passed legislation imposing restrictions that could affect the ability of REITs to acquire interests in healthcare properties, including hospitals. Other similar laws or regulations could be enacted at the state or federal level. If we or our managers, tenants or borrowers fail to comply with the extensive laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to our or their businesses and the operation of our or their properties, we or they could face a number of remedial actions, including forced closure, loss of accreditation, bans on admissions of new patients or residents, enforcement actions, investigations, imposition of fines, ineligibility to receive reimbursement from governmental and private third-party payor programs or civil or criminal penalties with respect to a single community or more broadly. If any of these occur, our and our managers’, tenants’ and borrowers’ businesses, reputation, results of operations (including results of properties) or financial condition could be adversely affected. \nOur investments may expose us to unknown liabilities.\nWe may acquire or invest in properties or businesses that are subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability was asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties or businesses, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe may assume or incur liabilities, including, in some cases, contingent liabilities, and be exposed to actual or potential claims in connection with our acquisitions that adversely affect us, such as:\n•Liabilities relating to the clean-up or remediation of environmental conditions;\n•Unasserted claims of vendors or other persons dealing with the prior owners;\n•Liabilities, claims, litigation or obligations, including indemnification obligations, relating to periods prior to or following our acquisition;\n•Claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the sellers; and\n•Liabilities for taxes relating to periods prior to our acquisition.\nIf the liabilities we assume in connection with acquisitions are greater than expected, or if we discover obligations relating to the acquired properties or businesses, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe and our managers, tenants and borrowers may be adversely affected by complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and cybersecurity.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our managers, tenants and borrowers collect, use, store, disclose, transfer and otherwise process personal information, including personal information specific to tenants, residents and employees. We or our managers, tenants and borrowers may transfer some of this personal information to third parties who assist with certain aspects of our or their business for limited purposes. Accordingly, we and our managers, tenants and borrowers are subject to a variety of stringent data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations at the state, federal and international level, as well as contractual requirements and other obligations related to data privacy and cybersecurity. For more information about applicable data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, see “Government Regulation—United States Healthcare Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement—Data Privacy and Cybersecurity” for a discussion of U.S. data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations and “Government Regulation—International Healthcare Regulation” for a discussion of international data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations.\nThe legal and regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. Laws and regulations governing data privacy, cybersecurity and the unauthorized disclosure of personal information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, including the potential for inconsistent interpretation, and the implementation and maintenance of compliance measures may potentially elevate our costs. While we believe we have taken commercially reasonable steps, and depend on our managers, tenants and borrowers, to comply with applicable data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, these laws and regulations are in some cases relatively new and the interpretation and application of these laws and regulations are uncertain. Thus, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be deemed effective by regulatory authorities. As noted below, we and our managers, tenants and borrowers, are also subject to the possibility of cybersecurity threats or incidents, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws and regulations and may require us or our managers, tenants or borrowers to report certain incidents to affected individuals or the relevant regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future, also may require us or our managers, tenants or borrowers to modify our or their data processing practices and policies, incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses and otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our or their business. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us or our managers, tenants or borrowers to comply with applicable data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could result in enforcement actions, investigations, imposition of fines, or civil or criminal penalties. We and our tenants, managers and borrowers also may post public privacy policies and other documentation regarding our or their collection, use, disclosure and other processing of personal information, and any actual or perceived failure to comply with such published policies and other documentation may carry similar consequences or subject us or them to enforcement actions, investigations or litigation if such published policies and other documentation are found to be deceptive, unfair or \nmisrepresentative of our or their actual practices. If any of the foregoing occurs, our and our managers’, tenants’ and borrowers’ businesses, reputation, results of operations (including results of properties) or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and policies maintained by our managers, tenants or other counterparties may not adequately insure against losses.\nWe maintain or require in our lease, management and other agreements that our managers, tenants or other counterparties maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in each industry. Although we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements, we cannot assure you that we or our managers, tenants or other counterparties will be able to procure or maintain adequate levels of insurance. We also cannot assure you that we or our managers, tenants or other counterparties will maintain the insurance coverage required under our lease, management and other agreements, that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance under our lease, management and other agreements, that this insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or at all or that the policies maintained will fully cover all losses on our properties when a catastrophic event occurs. We cannot make any guaranty as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our managers, tenants and other counterparties. If we sustain losses in excess of our insurance coverage, we may be required to pay the difference and we could lose our investment in, or experience reduced profits and cash flows from, our operations.\nIn some cases, we and our managers and tenants may be subject to professional liability, general liability, employment, premise, data privacy, cybersecurity, environmental, unfair business practice and contracts claims brought by plaintiffs’ attorneys seeking significant damages and attorneys’ fees, some of which may not be insured or indemnified and some of which may result in significant damage awards. Due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against senior housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased, and the premiums on this insurance coverage remain costly. Insurance for other claims such as wage and hour, certain environmental, data privacy, cybersecurity and unfair business practices may no longer be available, and the premiums on that insurance coverage, to the extent it is available, remain costly. As a result, insurance protection against these claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our managers or tenants and may not be available at a reasonable cost or otherwise on terms that provide adequate coverage. If we or our managers and tenants are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities, and the adverse impact on our or our managers’ and tenants’ respective financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material, and could adversely affect our managers’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us.\nAdditionally, we and those of our managers and tenants who self-insure or who transfer risk of losses to a wholly-owned captive insurance company could incur large funded and unfunded property and liability expenses, which could materially adversely affect their or our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. \nFailure to maintain effective internal controls could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of that control. Because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud, effective internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatement and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and our operating internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls as a result of changes to our business or otherwise, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nWe could incur substantial liabilities and costs if any of our properties are found to be contaminated with hazardous substances or we become involved in any environmental disputes.\nUnder federal and state environmental laws and regulations, a current or former owner of real property may be liable for costs related to the investigation, removal and remediation of petroleum or hazardous or toxic substances that are released from or are present at or under, or that are disposed of in connection with, the property. Owners of real property may also face other environmental liabilities, including government fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities and damages for injuries to persons, property or natural resources. Environmental laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was aware of, or was responsible for, the presence, release or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum. In some circumstances, environmental liability may result from the activities of a current or former manager or \ntenant of the property. Although we generally have indemnification rights against the current managers or tenants of our properties for contamination they cause, that indemnification may not adequately cover all environmental costs. See “Government Regulation—Environmental Regulation” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.\nThere can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial assistance that we or our managers, tenants or borrowers will retain from programs implemented under the CARES Act and other pandemic-related legislation.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act and other certain legislation authorized funds to be distributed to healthcare providers through the Provider Relief Fund. We applied for and received funds from the Provider Relief Fund, as well as from other similar state and local programs, in late 2020 through 2022 on behalf of the assisted living communities in our SHOP segment. Many of our managers, tenants and borrowers also received grants from the Provider Relief Fund. As a recipient of funds from the Provider Relief Fund, we, our managers, tenants and borrowers are required to comply with detailed reporting requirements specified by HHS, including in some instances by providing a third party audit of the use of the funds. In addition, the HHS Office of Inspector General and Pandemic Response Accountability Committee each have the right to conduct their own audits of the use of funds from the Provider Relief Fund, and HHS has the right to recoup some or all of the payments if it determines noncompliance with its rules. We cannot assure you that some or all of the grants received by us, our managers, tenants and borrowers will not need to be repaid, which repayment could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur REIT Status Risks\nLoss of our status as a REIT would have significant adverse consequences for us and the value of our common stock.\nIf we lose our status as a REIT (currently or with respect to any tax years for which the statute of limitations has not expired), we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to satisfy our obligations, to implement our business strategy and to make distributions to our stockholders because:\n•We would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax for any taxable year for which we did not qualify as a REIT;\n•We could be subject to increased state and local taxes for those years; and\n•Unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the latest taxable year during which we were disqualified.\nIn addition, for any year in which we are otherwise unable to qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to pay dividends to maintain REIT status, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control, as well as new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions, may adversely affect our investors or our ability to remain qualified as a REIT for tax purposes. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, generally including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets, a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and a requirement to make distributions to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our net taxable income, excluding capital gains. Although we believe that we currently qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will continue to qualify for all future periods.\nEven if we qualify as a REIT, we are subject to some taxes on our income and property, including state, local, and foreign taxes, and U.S. federal income taxes in the case of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. To the extent the Company is required to pay any taxes under existing laws or due to future changes in law, we will have less cash available for distribution to shareholders.\nThe 90% distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions.\nTo comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid a nondeductible excise tax and federal corporate income tax on undistributed REIT taxable income, we must make annual distributions of 100% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Such distributions reduce the funds we have available to finance our investment, \nacquisition, development and redevelopment activity and may limit our ability to engage in transactions that are otherwise in the best interests of our stockholders.\nFrom time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements. For example, timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand, or non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may prevent us from having sufficient cash or liquid assets to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income.\nIn the event that timing differences occur (or, as applicable, we decide to retain cash or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation), we may seek to borrow funds, issue additional equity securities, pay taxable stock dividends, distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. Any of these actions may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations; however, see “—Our Capital Structure Risks—We are highly dependent on access to the capital markets. Limitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on us, including our ability to make required payments on our debt obligations, make distributions to our stockholders or make future investments necessary to implement our business strategy,” above. The terms of the instruments governing our existing indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain of these transactions.\nTo preserve our qualification as a REIT, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership limits with respect to our capital stock that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control of our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our common and preferred stock to enable us to preserve our REIT status. Our certificate of incorporation provides certain specified remedies if a transfer would violate one of the ownership limitations. In particular, if a person acquires beneficial or constructive ownership of more than the ownership limit (currently, 9.0%, in number or value, of our outstanding common stock or more than 9.9%, in number or value, of our outstanding preferred stock), or in violation of certain other limitations set forth in our certificate of incorporation, then the shares that are beneficially or constructively owned in excess of the relevant limitation are considered “excess shares.” Excess shares are automatically deemed transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable institution or other qualifying organization selected by our Board of Directors. The trust is entitled to all dividends with respect to the excess shares and the trustee may exercise all voting power over the excess shares. We also have the right to purchase the excess shares for a price equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the transaction that created the excess shares or (ii) the market price on the day we purchase the shares, and we may defer payment of the purchase price for up to five years. If we do not purchase the excess shares, the trustee of the trust is required to transfer the shares at the direction of our Board of Directors. The owner of the excess shares is entitled to receive the lesser of the proceeds from the sale of the excess shares or the original purchase price for such excess shares, and any additional amounts are payable to the beneficiary of the trust. These ownership limits could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur use of taxable REIT subsidiaries is limited under the Code. \nUnder the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs’ operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. Also, our TRSs may not, among other things, operate or manage healthcare facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax as a result of transactions involving our TRSs to the extent that it is determined that those transactions resulted in our TRSs having less taxable income than the TRSs would have had if the transactions were undertaken by unrelated parties on an arm's-length basis. We believe our arrangements with or involving our TRSs are on arm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities (including investing in our tenants) or liquidate otherwise attractive investments. \nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments we might \notherwise make (including investments in our tenants) or to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. This limited investment scope could also lead to financial risks or limit our flexibility during times of operating instability.\nThe lease of qualified healthcare properties to a TRS is subject to special requirements. \nWe lease certain healthcare properties to TRSs, which in turn contract with third-party managers to manage the healthcare operations at these properties. The rents we receive from a TRS pursuant to this arrangement are treated as qualifying rents from real property if the healthcare property is a qualified health care property (as defined in the Code), the rents are paid pursuant to a lease with a TRS and the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). The determination of what is a qualified healthcare property is complex and, particularly with respect to unlicensed properties, dependent on the day-to-day operations and other arrangements in place at those properties. We believe that we have appropriately determined which of our properties are properly characterized as qualified healthcare properties and that we have structured the applicable leases and related arrangements in a manner intended to meet these requirements, but there can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied. If any of these conditions is not satisfied with respect to a particular lease, then the rents we receive with respect to such lease will not be qualifying rents, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with REIT income tests and thus on our ability to qualify as a REIT unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions.\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes.\nA REIT’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, unless certain safe harbor exceptions apply. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to satisfy the available safe harbors. \nVentas may incur adverse tax consequences if New Senior or any of Ventas’s subsidiary REITs failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \nVentas completed its merger with New Senior and received an opinion from REIT counsel to the effect that, at all times starting with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014 and through the closing date, New Senior was organized and operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. The opinion is not binding on the IRS or any court, and it is possible that the IRS could take a contrary position or that this tax position might not be sustained. If New Senior failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Ventas would succeed to any tax liabilities. These liabilities could be significant, and Ventas could possibly fail to qualify as a REIT. If New Senior failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for the five-year period after the merger, upon a taxable disposition of any of New Senior’s assets, Ventas could be subject to corporate-level tax with respect to all or a portion of the gain so recognized. Ventas’s REIT status also depends on the ongoing qualification of subsidiary entities qualifying as REITs or TRSs, as applicable, as a result of its substantial ownership interest in those entities.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs or taxes could have a negative effect on our stockholders or us.\nThe rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect our investors or us. New legislation, U.S. Treasury Department regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.",
