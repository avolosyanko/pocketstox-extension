With a balanced energy transition in mind, our strategy is focused on three engines of growth: Core, Digital, and New Energy.\nCore\n Consisting of our Reservoir Performance, WeIl Construction and Production Systems Divisions, Core remains SLB’s largest engine of growth. Building on decades of technology advancement, we will continue innovating new products, services and technologies that make the exploration, development and production of oil and gas assets cleaner, more cost effective, and more efficient, with lower carbon emissions and less impact on the environment.\n \nWe continue to build on our fit-for-basin approach and technology access initiatives, developing bespoke and custom technology tailored to the regions and environments in which we operate. This strategy allows us to address the rapid evolution of our industry into more regional markets, each with distinct resource plays and economics.\n\nWith the continued growth of digitally enabled technologies that improve efficiency and performance, including our Transition Technologies™ portfolio and our SLB End-to-end Emissions Solutions (SEES) methane elimination business, SLB provides solutions that enable customers to increase production from their reserves at a competitive cost and at a lower carbon intensity per barrel equivalent.\n \nDigital\nDigital capabilities continue to grow throughout the energy industry as a key element of the complex systems required to meet current energy demand, improve efficiency and to harness the promise of a lower-carbon future. SLB is uniquely positioned to support customers on their digital journeys by providing an offering which spans planning and operational workflows, underpinned by a data platform which allows customers to realize efficiency gains through AI.\n\nSLB’s customers have access to leading digital products that help to meet their sustainability goals by driving transparency, better measurement, more effective planning, and more impactful and reliable outcomes. To continue elevating customer offerings, we are accelerating the adoption of our proprietary Delfi™ offering, an open, scalable, and secure cloud-based software environment.\n \nOur cloud-based solutions allow our customers to transition from our established software applications to our Delfi digital platform, and shift from a user-based license model to software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscriptions. This enables customers to evolve from legacy infrastructure and deliver new levels of value creation, with access to key resources such as storage and increased computing power from our cloud partners and our industry-leading simulators. Our evolving offering of on-premises solutions allows us to support the digital transition journey of customers that prefer or are required to maintain data solutions locally.\n \nThrough our LumiTM data and AI platform, we also enable data-driven decision making for our customers across the energy industry. Data from a wide variety of sources across the subsurface and operations value chain can be accessed, facilitating AI-driven decision making at scale. The platform can connect diverse industry data sources, inclusive of on-premises data platforms and customer data infrastructure.\n \nWe are also focused on using digital technology to enhance operational performance for our customers. Our software products sold directly to customers, which are agnostic to equipment provider, enable automation and autonomy to reduce cost and improve performance. However, we also provide digital services to enhance the SLB equipment and service offering in our Core Divisions. Many of these services use embedded AI to automate insights and differentiate our service delivery offering.\n\nNew Energy\n New Energy offers a significant opportunity to use SLB’s experience and scale to drive innovation for a low-carbon economy spanning industries beyond oil and gas. We are building a broad, diverse portfolio across New Energy sectors, selected for their materiality and adjacency to existing SLB strengths and our ability to offer differentiated technology.\n\nOur New Energy portfolio builds on several fundamental SLB strengths: our unique subsurface domain expertise, applicable beyond oil and gas; our ability to design and deploy complex processing and production systems as an original equipment manufacturer; our differentiated track record for innovation and industrialization; and our ability to deploy at scale in any region of the world with local knowledge and talent.\n \nSLB will continue building businesses and forging partnerships across various industries to focus on three key areas: Industrial Decarbonization, Renewables and Energy Efficiency, and Critical Minerals.\n \nIndustrial Decarbonization focuses on providing technology and business solutions in the field of carbon capture and sequestration (“CCS”) and low-carbon hydrogen for hard-to-abate industries.\n\n•SLB has been in the CCS business for more than three decades and is actively progressing technologies to enable widespread adoption of CCS at scale. Our expertise extends beyond subsurface characterization and well construction to include capture technology, project economics, technology selection, and permitting. This includes the recent establishment of SLB Capturi, offering a modular product platform of industrial-scale carbon capture solutions. In addition, SLB is developing digital platforms to support emissions management for carbon and methane that will allow clients to measure, monitor, and plan abatement strategies. \n \n\n•SLB has also invested in Genvia, a unique private-public partnership that combines SLB’s expertise and experience with that of the French Atomic Energy and Alternative Energies Commission and partners. Genvia aims to deliver the most efficient and cost-effective solid oxide electrolyzer technology for producing clean hydrogen in hard-to-abate industrial settings—a key component of the energy transition.\n \nRenewables and Energy Efficiency refers to our technology and business solutions designed to enable renewable energy expansion and greater energy efficiency, with a focus on geothermal, geoenergy, and energy storage.\n\n•Geothermal power leverages the heat of the earth to generate electricity or provide heat directly, by tapping into subsurface hot water and steam zones. \n \n•Geoenergy uses the ambient temperatures beneath the earth's surface to act as a thermal battery and dramatically reduce energy consumption from heating and cooling buildings, driving both efficiency and decarbonization. \n \n•Stationary energy storage is a key enabler to make variable renewable energy sources (such as solar or wind) a larger component of the world’s electricity systems enabling power to be delivered in the right place, at the right time, to meet demand. As renewables become a greater percentage of the energy mix, the need increases for additional long-duration energy storage to ensure the efficiency of renewable assets and the reliability of electricity systems.\n \nCritical Minerals is a business area where SLB is applying its knowledge of extraction technologies and processing to the location and sourcing of critical minerals, such as lithium from brine deposits, which will be required to support the energy transition. An example of this is our demonstration plant in Clayton Valley, Nevada, which integrates direct lithium extraction, concentration and conversion technologies to more sustainably produce lithium at scale. This is achieved much faster than conventional methods, while using significantly less land, water and chemical reagents.\n \nSustainability\n SLB’s emissions reduction strategy is at the center of our identity and vision, and our commitment to a sustainable future is underscored by bold science-backed targets aligned with the Paris Agreement. In 2021, SLB became the first company in the energy services industry to commit to a 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions target including all three emission scopes.\n\nBy setting targets based on SLB’s total 2019 baseline GHG footprint—inclusive of Scope 3 emissions (which accounted for approximately 95% of SLB’s baseline)—and not just its Scope 1 and 2 footprint, SLB’s comprehensive emissions reduction roadmap addresses the entire energy value chain.\n \nSLB’s 2050 net-zero target is supported by the following interim milestones, using 2019 as the baseline year:\n - by 2025, a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions;\n - by 2030, a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions; and\n - by 2030, a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions.\n \nSLB’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions primarily come from fuel use and electricity consumption. SLB’s Scope 3 emissions are indirect, such as emissions from customers’ use of SLB technology and emissions from our use of third-party goods and services.\n \nThere are three key components to SLB achieving the 2050 net-zero target: reducing operational emissions, reducing customer emissions that occur while using SLB technology, and taking carbon-negative actions of sufficient scale to offset any residual operating and technology emissions that SLB may have in 2050.\n\nIn tandem with our 2050 net-zero commitment, SLB introduced a portfolio of Transition Technologies™ in 2021. This portfolio includes a select group of products and services that quantifiably reduce our customers’ GHG emissions footprint, while continuing to drive high performance, reliability, and efficiency. This portfolio is supported by an impact quantification framework and will continue to grow as sustainability is further embedded in SLB’s research and development process.\n Human Capital\n As a leading global technology company that operates in more than 100 countries with a workforce of approximately 110,000 people from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and nationalities, one of SLB’s greatest strengths is the diversity of our people. We believe that our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain a highly competent and diverse workforce has been paramount to our success for many decades. We recognize that cultivating diversity and promoting inclusion are essential to attracting the best talent from around the world and enabling creativity and innovation to drive business success. We believe our strong culture focused on workforce diversity, inclusivity, and learning and development results in the best possible working environment for all our people.\nWorkforce Diversity\n SLB's long-standing commitment to national and cultural diversity is reflected in our workforce composition and our philosophy to recruit and develop people from the communities in which we operate. Our workforce nationality mix generally aligns with the revenue derived from the countries in which we work, as reflected in the charts below. This fosters a culture that is global in outlook, yet local in practice.\n\nSLB also recognizes the importance of gender diversity as a source of creativity, innovation, and competitive advantage. We are committed to leading our industry in this area and, in this regard, a number of years ago we established goals of having women represent 25% of our salaried workforce by 2025 and 30% by 2030. We reached our first milestone ahead of schedule, as women represented 25% of our salaried workforce as of December 31, 2024.\n \nInclusivity\n We are building on our diversity to foster a strong culture of inclusion, in which each person can feel accepted, respected, and empowered to perform at their best. SLB has numerous global policies and programs to support our inclusive culture, including:\n •a Code of Conduct that outlines the standards of behavior and ethics that all employees are expected to follow, and that prohibits any form of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation;\n •a diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) strategy supported by a network of inclusion champions that promote DEI awareness and best practices; and \n •a mobility program that enables employees to gain international exposure and experience and develop cross-cultural competencies.\n \nLearning and Development\n SLB invests significantly in the learning and development of our people. We encourage a growth mindset and provide opportunities to our people for continuous learning throughout their career. This investment allows us to accelerate personal development while maximizing performance, fostering an agile workforce with the skills necessary to lead SLB today and into the future.\n \nSLB believes that through diversity, inclusivity, and growth mindset, we can support our people to reach their full potential, which unlocks value for all of our stakeholders.\n \nCompetition\n The principal methods of competition within the energy services industry are technological innovation, quality of service, and price differentiation. These factors vary geographically and are dependent upon the different services and products that SLB offers. SLB has numerous competitors, both large and small.\nIntellectual Property\n SLB owns or controls one of the industry’s leading portfolios of intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information, trade secrets, and software tools and applications that, in the aggregate, are material to SLB’s business. While SLB seeks and holds a significant number of patents covering various products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is material to SLB’s business.\nSeasonality\nSeasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of SLB’s products and services. For example, the spring thaw in Canada and other Northern climates and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels, while the winter months in the North Sea, Russia, and China can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity. In addition, hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations. Furthermore, customer spending patterns for exploration data, software, and other products may result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of the year as clients seek to fully utilize their annual budgets. Conversely, customer budget constraints in North America may lead to lower demand for our services and products in the fourth quarter of the year.\nCustomers\n SLB’s primary customers are national oil companies, large integrated oil companies, and independent operators. No single customer exceeded 10% of SLB's consolidated revenue during each of 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nGovernmental Regulations\nSLB is subject to numerous environmental and other governmental and regulatory requirements related to its operations worldwide.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forward-looking statements,” which are discussed immediately following Item 7A. of this Form 10-K and elsewhere. These risk factors should also be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\n\nPlease carefully consider the risks described below, which discuss the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, other material included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K, and other reports and materials that we file with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\n Demand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers, which can change based on many factors, including fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Oil and gas industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand for oilfield products and services and lower expenditures by our customers, which has in the past had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n \nDemand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future demand for oil and gas and future oil and gas prices, as well as our customers’ ability to access capital. In addition, the transition of the global energy sector from a primarily fossil fuel-based system to a diverse system which includes renewable energy sources could affect our customers’ levels of expenditures.\n\nActual and anticipated declines in oil and gas prices have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n \nHistorically, oil and gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n•changes in the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons, which are affected by general economic and business conditions; \n •the costs of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and gas; \n •the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the expanded alliance known as OPEC+ to set and maintain production levels for oil; \n •the level of oil and gas exploration and production activity; \n •the level of excess production capacity; \n •the level of refining and storage capacity; \n •the level of oil and gas inventories; \n •access to potential resources; \n •political and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest; \n •governmental laws, policies, regulations, subsidies, and other actions, including initiatives to promote the use of renewable energy sources; \n •speculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and gas futures contracts; \n •technological advances affecting energy consumption; and \n •extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, and public health or similar issues, such as pandemics and epidemics. \n \nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our products and services and downward pressure on the prices that we are able to charge. Sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for our products and services. A significant industry downturn, sustained market uncertainty, or increased availability of economical alternative energy sources could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\n\nDisruptions in the political, regulatory, economic, and social environments of the countries in which we operate or globally could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are a global technology company, and our non-US operations accounted for approximately 85% of our consolidated revenue in 2024, and 84% in 2023 and 2022. Geopolitical instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we operate could result in business disruptions or operational challenges that may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, or our reputation, our financial condition, and our results of operations and cash flows. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \n•uncertain or volatile political, social, and economic conditions;\n •exposure to expropriation, nationalization, deprivation or confiscation of our assets or the assets of our customers, or other governmental actions; \n •social unrest, acts of terrorism, war, or other armed conflict; \n\n\n•confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies; \n •theft of, or lack of sufficient legal protection for, proprietary technology and other intellectual property; \n •deprivation of contract rights; \n •trade and economic sanctions or other restrictions imposed by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, or other regions or countries that could restrict or curtail our ability to operate in certain markets; \n •public health crises; \n •local content and other similar regional requirements; \n •unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation or enforcement of existing laws; \n •restrictions on the repatriation of income or capital; \n •supply chain disruptions;\n •currency exchange controls; \n •currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations; and \n •inflation.\n \nAs an example of a risk resulting from our global operations, in March 2022 we decided to immediately suspend new investment and technology deployment to our Russia operations. In July 2023, we announced that we were halting shipments of products into Russia from all our facilities worldwide in response to the continued expansion of international sanctions. Russia represented approximately 4% of our worldwide revenue during 2024. The carrying value of our net assets in Russia was approximately $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2024. This consisted of $0.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, $0.3 billion of receivables, $0.2 billion of fixed assets, $0.3 billion of other assets, and $0.3 billion of current liabilities.\n \nWe continue to actively monitor the dynamic situation in Russia and Ukraine and applicable laws, sanctions and trade control restrictions resulting from the conflict. The extent to which our reputation, operations, financial results and cash flows, including the ability to repatriate cash, may be affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine will depend on various factors, including the extent and duration of the conflict; the effects of the conflict on regional and global economic and geopolitical conditions; the effect of further laws, sanctions and trade control restrictions on our business, the global economy and global supply chains; and the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the ruble. Continuation or escalation of the conflict may also exacerbate this and other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, including cybersecurity, regulatory, and reputational risks.\n \nFailure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Our long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address the energy transition, which will require adapting our technology portfolio to changing customer preferences and government requirements, developing solutions to decarbonize oil and gas operations, and scaling innovative low-carbon and carbon-neutral technologies. If the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate, demand for our products and services, as well as our relationships with various stakeholders, could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we fail or are perceived to not effectively implement an energy transition strategy, or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel-related industries, our access to capital or the market for our securities could be negatively impacted.\n\nOur operations are subject to cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n Our success depends in part on our ability to provide effective cybersecurity protection in connection with our digital technologies and services as well as our internal digital infrastructure. We operate information technology networks and systems for internal purposes that incorporate third-party software and technologies. We also connect to and exchange data with external networks that may be operated by our customers, suppliers, alliance partners, or other third parties. We provide digital technologies that allow us or our customers to remotely perform wellsite and field operations. We also develop software and other digital products and services that store, retrieve, manipulate, and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, personal data, and our own data.\n\nOur digital technologies and services, as well as third-party products, services and technologies that we rely on (including emerging technologies, such as AI programs), are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques and tools (including AI) that circumvent controls, evade detection and even remove forensic evidence of the infiltration. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program, processes, or systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. We have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including attacks resulting from social engineering such as phishing and ransomware infections. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we also rely on providers of third-party products, services, and networks, with whom we may share data and services, and who may be unable to effectively defend their digital technologies and services against attack.\n\nUnauthorized access to or modification of, or actions disabling our ability to obtain authorized access to, our customers’ data, other external data, personal data, or our own data, as a result of a cyber incident, attack or exploitation of a security vulnerability, or loss of\n\ncontrol of our clients’ operations could result in significant damage to our reputation or disruption of the services we provide to our customers or of our customers’ businesses. In addition, allegations, reports, or concerns regarding vulnerabilities affecting our digital products or services could damage our reputation. This could lead to fewer customers using our digital products and services, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future prospects. In addition, if our systems or third-party products, services, and network systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of or damage to our intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information; loss of customer, supplier, or our employee data; breach of personal data; interruption of our business operations; disruption of our customers’ businesses; increased legal and regulatory exposure, including fines and remediation costs; and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our employees, our customers, our suppliers, our alliance partners and other third parties, and may result in claims against us.\n\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold.\nThe energy industry is highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Our business may be adversely affected if we fail to continue developing and producing innovative technologies in response to changes in the market, including customer and government requirements, or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-competitive manner. If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in our industry, our ability to maintain market share, defend, maintain, or increase prices for our products and services, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers could be adversely affected. Furthermore, competing or new technologies may accelerate the obsolescence of our products or services and reduce the value of our intellectual property.\n\nLimitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold.\nThere can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate. Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets.\n \nThird parties may claim that we have infringed upon or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights.\n The tools, techniques, methodologies, programs, and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis. Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies. If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product.\n Legal and Regulatory Risks\nOur operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n Our operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, human rights, import/export controls, currency, emissions reporting, exchange, bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, antitrust, and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, have tended to become more stringent over time, and could conflict among one another. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n \nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and other similar laws. We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons. Our ability to transfer people, products, and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations.\n\nThe internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors, or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of applicable laws, including securities, environmental, trade control, trade sanctions, or anti-corruption laws, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition. In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships.\n \n\nExisting or future laws, regulations, court orders or other public- or private-sector initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions or relating to climate change may reduce demand for our products and services.\nContinuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and proposed international agreements and national, regional, and local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. The implementation of these agreements, including the Paris Agreement, the Europe Climate Law, and other existing or future regulatory mandates, may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, impose taxes on us or our customers, require us or our customers to reduce GHG emissions from our technologies or operations, or accelerate the obsolescence of our products or services.\n \nIn addition, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of litigation or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions, as well as descriptions of their sustainable products and services. As a result, we or our customers may become subject to court orders compelling a reduction of GHG emissions or requiring mitigation of the effects of climate change, or requiring other mitigation actions.\n\nThere is also increased focus by our customers, investors and other stakeholders on climate change, sustainability, and energy transition matters. Actions to address these concerns or negative perceptions of our industry or fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment have led to initiatives to conserve energy and promote the use of alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services. In addition, initiatives by investors and financial institutions to limit funding to companies in fossil fuel-related industries may adversely affect our liquidity or access to capital. Any of these initiatives may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing GHG and other air emissions, water discharges and waste management, as well as the importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals, and explosives. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent, and expensive to implement. These laws sometimes provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety. Strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances, and, as a result, we could be liable for the actions of others.\n\nWe use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances. In addition, stricter enforcement or changing interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the enactment of new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition.\n\nWe could be subject to substantial liability claims, including as a result of well incidents, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety, and environmental risks. Our operations involve the use of radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development, and production environments. Accidents or acts of malfeasance involving these services (including remotely operated services) or equipment, or a failure of a product or service (including as a result of a cyberattack), could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations, which could materially adversely affect us. Any well incidents, including blowouts at a well site or any loss of containment or well control, may expose us to additional liabilities, which could be material. Generally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases, and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events. However, our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n \nRisks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of ChampionX\n We may be unable to complete the proposed acquisition of ChampionX.\n We or ChampionX may terminate the merger agreement between the parties (the “merger agreement”) in certain circumstances as described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 2, 2024. If the proposed acquisition is not completed for any reason, including as a result of failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected; we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, customers, suppliers and other constituencies; we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the acquisition; and we may be required to pay a termination fee under certain circumstances set forth in the merger agreement.\n\n\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed acquisition of ChampionX.\nIf the acquisition is completed, the success of the acquisition will depend on, among other things, our ability to combine our business with that of ChampionX in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\n\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur aspirations, goals, and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks.\n We have developed, and will continue to develop and set, goals, targets, and other objectives related to sustainability matters, including our net-zero emissions target and our energy transition strategy. Statements related to these goals, targets, and objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Our targets are based on empirical data and estimates that reflect our understanding of current best practices for measuring or estimating emissions or other metrics, but we anticipate that future innovations in both measurement technologies and estimation methodologies could cause us to revise our baseline as well as re-calculate progress toward our targets.\n\nOur business faces increased scrutiny from certain investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, including any third-party ratings used by stakeholders, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, our ability to access capital, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\n\nFailure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impede our operations.\n Our future success depends on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified personnel. We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. Competition for the personnel necessary for our businesses intensifies as activity increases, technology evolves and customer demands change. In periods of high utilization, it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals. This could increase our costs or have other material adverse effects on our operations.\n \nSevere weather events, including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change, have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur business has been, and in the future will be, affected by severe weather events in areas where we operate, which could materially affect our operations and financial results. Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding, landslides, and heat waves have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, the evacuation of personnel, stoppage of services and activity disruptions at our facilities, in our supply chain, or at well-sites, or result in disruptions to our customers’ operations. Particularly severe weather events affecting platforms or structures may result in a suspension of activities. Climate change may impact the frequency and/or intensity of such events. In addition, acute or chronic physical impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall, and hurricane-strength winds may damage our facilities. Any such extreme weather events may result in increased operating costs or decreases in revenue.",
