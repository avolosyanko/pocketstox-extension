      "text": "ITEM 1.BUSINESS\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. We have seven approved medicines: five that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (“CF”), a life-threatening genetic disease, one that treats severe sickle cell disease (“SCD”) and transfusion dependent beta thalassemia (“TDT”), life shortening inherited blood disorders, and one that treats moderate-to-severe acute pain. Our clinical-stage pipeline includes programs in CF, SCD, beta thalassemia, acute and peripheral neuropathic pain, APOL1-mediated kidney disease, IgA nephropathy and other autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias, type 1 diabetes, myotonic dystrophy type 1, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.\nOur goal in CF is to continue to extend our leadership by developing treatment regimens that will provide benefits to all people with CF. In December 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approved ALYFTREK (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor), our fifth medicine for people with CF. In addition to ALYFTREK, our marketed medicines that treat people with CF are TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor), ORKAMBI (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) and KALYDECO (ivacaftor). Collectively, our five marketed CF medicines are being used to treat nearly three quarters of the approximately 94,000 people with CF in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Canada. \nThrough approval of new medicines, label expansions, and expanded reimbursement, we are focused on increasing the number of people with CF who are eligible and able to receive our medicines. We are evaluating our current medicines in additional patient populations, including younger children, with the goal of having small molecule treatments for all people who have at least one mutation in their cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (“CFTR”) gene that is responsive to our CFTR modulators. In December 2024, the FDA approved the expanded use of TRIKAFTA for treatment of people with CF. With this approval, 94 additional non-F508del CFTR mutations have been added to the TRIKAFTA label. We are evaluating VX-522, an investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”) therapeutic that we are developing in collaboration with Moderna, Inc. (“Moderna”) in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in people with CF. The multiple ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing, and we expect to share data in the first half of 2025. VX-522 has the potential to benefit the more than 5,000 people with CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia who do not make full-length CFTR protein and therefore cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. In addition, we are continuing our research and development of additional CFTR modulators, with the aim of developing best-in-class medicines that can help more patients achieve normal levels of CFTR function, and we are investigating additional potential treatments for people with CF who do not make full-length CFTR protein and cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. \nIn SCD and TDT, our goal is to eliminate vaso-occlusive crises (“VOCs”) (as well as vaso-occlusive organ damage) and transfusion dependence, respectively. Our marketed therapy is CASGEVY (exagamglogene autotemcel), an ex-vivo, non-viral CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy, which has been approved in the United States (“U.S.”), the European Union (“E.U.”), the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (“Saudi Arabia”), the Kingdom of Bahrain (“Bahrain”), the United Arab Emirates (the “UAE”), Canada and Switzerland for treatment of people 12 years of age and older with SCD or TDT. We estimate approximately 60,000 people with severe SCD or TDT are or could become eligible for CASGEVY in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. We are evaluating CASGEVY as a treatment for children 5 to 11 years of age with SCD or TDT in global Phase 3 clinical trials. We are progressing preclinical assets for gentler conditioning for CASGEVY, which could broaden the eligible patient population, and investigating small molecules for the potential treatment of SCD and TDT. \nIn January 2025, the FDA approved JOURNAVX (suzetrigine), our selective non-opioid NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. We have begun our commercial launch of JOURNAVX in eligible adults in the U.S. In addition, we are enrolling and dosing patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating suzetrigine for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain. We are enrolling and dosing patients in two Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating VX-993, a next-generation selective NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor, for the treatment of acute pain and for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In December 2024, we announced results from a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating suzetrigine in people with lumbosacral radiculopathy (“LSR”). Treatment with suzetrigine \n![alt  pipeline slide 2.4.25.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/875320/000087532025000053/vrtx-20241231_g1.jpg)\ndemonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful within-group reduction in pain and we plan to advance to pivotal development in LSR, pending discussions with regulators. \nThe following chart sets forth our approved products, clinical-stage programs, and select pre-clinical programs:\nBeyond CF, SCD, TDT and pain, we are advancing programs across multiple disease areas and modalities, including: \n•APOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease. We are evaluating inaxaplin, our small molecule for the treatment of APOL1-mediated kidney disease (“AMKD”). We continue to enroll and dose people with AMKD in the Phase 3 portion of the global Phase 2/3 clinical trial.\n•IgA Nephropathy. We are developing povetacicept, a dual inhibitor of the B cell activating factor (“BAFF”) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (“APRIL”) pathways, as a potentially best-in-class approach to treat IgA nephropathy (“IgAN”), a serious progressive, autoimmune kidney disease that can lead to end-stage renal disease. We are enrolling and dosing patients in the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating povetacicept in people with IgAN.\n•Type 1 Diabetes. Zimislecel, formerly known as VX-880, is an allogeneic stem-cell derived, fully differentiated islet cell therapy in pivotal development for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (“T1D”). We expect to complete enrollment and dosing in the Phase 3 portion of this Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial in 2025. Our second clinical program in T1D, VX-264, in which zimislecel is encapsulated in an immunoprotective device, is ongoing. We are also pursuing alternative approaches to immunosuppression that could be used with zimislecel, as well as hypoimmune cells.\n•Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1. We are exploring multiple approaches to address the underlying causal biology for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (“DM1”), including small molecules. We completed the single ascending dose portion of the global Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating VX-670, an oligonucleotide-based approach that we have in-licensed from Entrada Therapeutics, Inc. (“Entrada”). We are enrolling and dosing the multiple ascending dose portion of the trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-670.\n•Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease. We are nearing completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers evaluating VX-407, our first-in-class small molecule corrector that targets the underlying cause of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (“ADPKD”) in people with a subset of variants in the PKD1 gene. We expect to advance VX-407 into a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in people with ADPKD in 2025.\n•In addition to the programs listed above, we have additional research programs aimed at diseases that fit our research and development strategy and follow-on programs in our existing disease areas in accord with our serial innovation approach.\nOur core strategy is to discover and develop innovative medicines by combining transformative advances in the understanding of human disease and the science of therapeutics to dramatically advance human health. That strategy focuses on validated targets that address causal human biology, predictive lab assays and clinical biomarkers, rapid paths to registration and approval, and product candidates that hold the potential for transformative patient benefit. Our approach includes advancing multiple compounds or therapies from each program into early clinical trials to obtain patient data that can inform selection of the most promising therapies for later stage development as well as inform our ongoing discovery and development efforts. We aim to rapidly follow our first-in-class therapies that achieve proof-of-concept with potential best-in-class candidates. We plan to continue investing to advance our strategy, fostering scientific innovation by identifying additional product candidates through internal research efforts, and investing in business development transactions to access emerging technologies, products and product candidates. \nOur serial innovation approach is intended to increase the likelihood of successfully bringing transformative medicines to patients and to provide durable clinical and commercial success. Our CF medicines are the exemplar of this strategy, as we continue to reach more people with CF than ever before through approvals of new medicines, approvals in new geographies, label expansions, including for younger patients, and expanded reimbursement. In addition, we have diversified our business through the approvals for CASGEVY for the treatment of SCD and TDT and through the approval for JOURNAVX for the treatment of acute pain. We are working to ensure broad access for eligible patients with these conditions in all countries with regulatory approval. Within our clinical pipeline, we have rapidly progressed multiple programs into pivotal development during the last year. As we continue to invest in our serial innovation strategy, launch new products, advance our diverse pipeline, and expand geographically, we continue to maintain a strong financial profile.\nMARKETED PRODUCTS\nInformation regarding our marketed products, including information regarding the disease area, initial approval and age group for which the therapy is approved, are set forth in the table below.\n\n                 Disease           Initial Approval            Eligible Age Group(1)\n                                                                     Cystic Fibrosis\n                                               2024         6 years of age and older\n                                               2019         2 years of age and older\n                                               2020         2 years of age and older\n                                               2018         6 years of age and older\n                                               2018         6 years of age and older\n                                               2015          1 year of age and older\n                                               2012         1 month of age and older\n                      Sickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia\n                                               2023        12 years of age and older\n                                                                          Acute Pain\n                                               2025                           adults\n(1) Specifies the youngest eligible age group in any major market. \nCF\nOur CF medicines are collectively being used by nearly three quarters of the approximately 94,000 people with CF in the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Canada. Additionally, we continue to secure formal reimbursement in multiple additional countries that collectively comprise approximately 15,000 additional people with CF. Approximately 10,000 of those additional people with CF are eligible for treatment with CFTR modulators. We previously served many of these markets through named patient sales.\nCF is a life-shortening genetic disease caused by a defective or missing CFTR protein resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene. To develop CF, children must inherit two defective CFTR genes, which are referred to as alleles; one allele is inherited from each parent. The vast majority of patients with CF carry at least one F508del mutation. The F508del mutation results in a defect in the CFTR protein in which the CFTR protein does not reach the surface of the cells in sufficient quantities and does not adequately transport chloride ions. \nThe absence of working CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of cells in a number of organs, including the lungs. As a result, thick, sticky mucus builds up and blocks the passages in many organs, leading to a variety of symptoms. In particular, mucus builds up and clogs the airways in the lungs, causing chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage. CFTR potentiators, such as ivacaftor and deutivacaftor, increase the probability that the CFTR protein channels open on the cell surface, increasing the flow of salt and water into and out of the cell. CFTR correctors, such as lumacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor and vanzacaftor, increase the proper protein processing and folding of mutant CFTR proteins, such that a larger amount of functional CFTR protein reaches the cell surface. Our CFTR regimens target the underlying cause of disease and have been shown to improve CFTR protein function in people with CF, and as such have been shown to provide transformative benefit for people living with CF. \nOur CF medicines are used by patients in over 60 countries, and TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO is approved and reimbursed or accessible in more than 50 of these countries. We continue to increase the number of patients eligible and able to receive our current medicines through approvals of new medicines, label expansions and expanded reimbursement. In December 2024, the FDA approved the expanded use of TRIKAFTA for the treatment of people with CF 2 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or a mutation that is responsive to TRIKAFTA based on clinical and/or in vitro data. With this approval, 94 additional non-F508del CFTR mutations have been added to the TRIKAFTA label.\nIn December 2024, the FDA approved ALYFTREK for the treatment of people with CF 6 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation or another mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ALYFTREK. ALYFTREK is our next-in-class triple combination, which has the benefit of a once-daily dosing regimen and demonstrated non-inferiority to TRIKAFTA in ppFEV1, a measure of lung function, and an improvement in sweat chloride levels as compared to TRIKAFTA. ALYFTREK carries a lower royalty burden than our other approved CF medicines and is also approved for 31 additional mutations not responsive to other CFTR modulator therapies. \nSickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia \nCASGEVY, our therapy for SCD and TDT, is approved in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Canada and Switzerland. SCD and TDT are hemoglobinopathies, a group of inherited blood disorders that result from gene mutations that alter hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen throughout the body. We estimate approximately 60,000 people with severe SCD or TDT are or could become eligible for CASGEVY in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. \nSCD is caused by the change of a single amino acid in the β-hemoglobin gene that causes red cells to change shape in settings of low oxygen. These sickled cells block blood flow and can lead to severe pain (known as vaso-occlusive crises), organ damage, and shortened life span. Treatment is typically focused on relieving pain and minimizing organ damage, requiring medication and, for some patients, monthly blood transfusions and frequent hospital visits. \nBeta thalassemia is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the same β-hemoglobin gene that lead to severe anemia in patients, which causes fatigue and shortness of breath. In infants, beta thalassemia causes failure to thrive, jaundice, and feeding problems. Complications of beta thalassemia can lead to an enlarged spleen, liver and/or heart, misshapen bones and delayed puberty. Treatment for beta thalassemia varies depending on the disease severity for each patient. Patients with TDT, the most severe form of the disease, require regular blood transfusions, as frequently as every two to four weeks. Repeated blood transfusions eventually cause an unhealthy buildup of iron in the patient, leading to organ damage. \nCASGEVY, our ex-vivo, non-viral CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing therapy, was developed for the treatment of severe SCD and TDT, with our collaborator, CRISPR Therapeutics AG (“CRISPR”). Patients first undergo a treatment at an authorized treatment center (“ATC”) that mobilizes a population of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (“HSPC”) from the bone marrow into the bloodstream. These cells are collected from the patient’s bloodstream and transferred to a manufacturing facility where the HSPCs are purified and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing is performed. The gene-editing procedure results in a precise and specific gene-edit in a non-coding intron of the BCL11A gene. Following manufacturing, the edited cells, now called CASGEVY, are transferred back to the ATC. Patients are preconditioned with a myeloablative \nconditioning treatment that ablates their bone marrow prior to infusion of CASGEVY. After the edited HSPC cells are returned to the patient and engraft, the gene-edit results in significant increases in the levels of fetal hemoglobin erythrocytes, thereby reducing or eliminating symptoms associated with disease. Efficacy data support the profile of CASGEVY as a potential one-time functional cure for people with severe SCD and TDT. \nOur global launch strategy for CASGEVY continues to focus on countries with high unmet medical need and infrastructure to support treatment with this CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing therapy, including the U.S., the Middle East, and major markets in Europe. We are working with ATCs to enable patient initiation, supporting the patient journey through infusion with CASGEVY, and working with payors to secure broad and equitable access for patients. With more than 50 ATCs activated globally, our strategy is focused on activation of a global ATC network to treat patients and expansion of our globally-enabled manufacturing and supply chain to meet growing patient demand. Our teams are also focused on working to educate patients, physicians and policymakers on the treatment journey and CASGEVY clinical data, where appropriate. \nAcute Pain \nAcute pain is a disabling condition that may occur suddenly but typically lasts less than 90 days and resolves in days or weeks (for example, following surgery or an injury). It is estimated that over 80 million people are prescribed a medicine for acute pain every year in the U.S. Currently available treatments have limitations around efficacy or side effects, including a risk of addiction. Because of these challenges, over- and under-utilization, as well as misutilization, of current pain medicines may occur. \nIn January 2025, the FDA approved JOURNAVX for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adults. The approval was based on two positive randomized controlled Phase 3 clinical trials and supported by a positive single arm Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating safety and effectiveness. JOURNAVX is a first-in-class, oral pain signal inhibitor that is highly selective for NaV1.8 voltage-gated sodium channels. Through this mechanism, JOURNAVX provides effective relief of pain without evidence of the limitations of other currently available therapies, including the addictive potential of opioids.\nOur launch strategy for JOURNAVX focuses on securing broad access for people with acute pain, educating patients and physicians on the clinical profile of JOURNAVX, and making investments to provide a seamless treatment experience for physicians and people with acute pain. We are engaging with payors and formulary decision makers to secure reimbursement and access to JOURNAVX. We are working to secure national retail distribution to facilitate broad availability of JOURNAVX as well as financial and co-pay assistance programs for patients that will support access to JOURNAVX. \nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS\nWe invest in research and development to discover and develop transformative medicines for people with serious diseases, with a focus on specialty markets. Our research strategy is to combine transformative advances in the understanding of human disease and in the science of therapeutics to dramatically advance human health. We focus on:\n•disease areas with known causal human biology; \n•targets validated by causal human biology;\n•predictive lab assays and clinical biomarkers;\n•potential for transformative benefit regardless of modality; and\n•efficient path to registration and approval.\nOur development-stage product candidates are focused on the treatment of serious diseases, including CF, SCD, TDT, acute and peripheral neuropathic pain, AMKD, IgAN and other autoimmune renal diseases and cytopenias, T1D, DM1, and ADPKD. In pursuit of serial innovation, our research and development approach includes advancing multiple candidates into clinical trials and pursuing multiple modalities with the goal of bringing first-in-class and/or best-in-class therapies to patients. \nOur research and development strategy has been validated through our success in moving novel product candidates into clinical trials and obtaining marketing approvals for ALYFTREK, TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, and \nSYMDEKO/SYMKEVI for the treatment of CF, CASGEVY for the treatment of SCD and TDT, and JOURNAVX for the treatment of acute pain. Our approach to drug discovery has been further validated by our successful demonstration of clinical proof-of-concept in four additional disease areas: in diabetic peripheral neuropathy with our NaV1.8 inhibitors, in AMKD with inaxaplin, in T1D with zimislecel, and in IgAN with povetacicept. \nOver the last several years, this strategy has led us to expand our capabilities to include additional innovative therapeutic modalities with a focus on cell and genetic therapies, which have the potential to treat, and in some cases, cure diseases by addressing the underlying cause of the disease. CASGEVY, approved in multiple geographies, including the U.S., is one such example. We continue to make significant internal investments in cell and genetic therapies. These investments include the development of a Boston-based campus for research and current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) clinical manufacturing capabilities dedicated to our portfolio of cell and genetic therapy technologies and teams. \n To augment our internal programs, we acquire businesses and technologies and collaborate with biopharmaceutical and technology companies, leading academic research institutions, government laboratories, foundations and other organizations to advance research in our disease areas of interest, as well as to access technologies needed to execute on our strategy. Our internal and external innovation approaches are based on the same strategy, which enables us to effectively integrate and execute on new internal capabilities as we invest in external innovation. Our investments in external innovation include our collaboration with CRISPR, which resulted in the successful development and approval of CASGEVY and the establishment and advancement of other pipeline programs, including our T1D program through our acquisition of Semma Therapeutics, Inc. (“Semma”), our expansion of our renal programs through our acquisition of Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (“Alpine”), our mRNA therapeutic, VX-522, for treatment of CF through our collaboration with Moderna, and our intracellular therapeutics for DM1, including VX-670, through our collaboration with Entrada.\nCF \nWe are enrolling and dosing in a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ALYFTREK in children with CF 2 to 5 years of age who have at least one F508del mutation or a mutation responsive to triple combination CFTR modulators.\nWe estimate that approximately 90% of people with CF could benefit from our five approved medicines, including TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO and the recently approved ALYFTREK. We continue to identify and develop additional CFTR modulators with the goal of developing best-in-class medicines that can help more patients who respond to CFTR modulators achieve normal levels of CFTR function; our next generation of CFTR modulators have completed, or are in the process of completing, Phase 1 clinical trials.\nIn order to treat people with CF who do not make full-length CFTR protein, and as a result, cannot benefit from our CFTR modulators, we are researching and developing genetic therapies, such as mRNA, and gene-editing approaches to CF. In collaboration with Moderna, we are developing VX-522, a nebulized CF mRNA therapeutic designed to treat the underlying cause of CF lung disease for these people by enabling cells in the lungs to produce functional CFTR protein. The multiple ascending dose portion of the clinical trial is ongoing and we expect data in the first half of 2025. We believe that VX-522 has the potential to benefit more than 5,000 people with CF in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia.\nSickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-Dependent Beta Thalassemia \nTwo global Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating CASGEVY in children 5 to 11 years of age with severe SCD (the CLIMB SCD-151 clinical trial) and TDT (the CLIMB THAL-141 clinical trial) are ongoing. We have completed enrollment in these two clinical trials, and we expect to complete dosing in 2025. \nIn connection with our serial innovation approach, we are advancing preclinical assets for myeloablative conditioning agents with improved tolerability profiles, which we refer to as “gentler conditioning agents,” which could be used in connection with treatment with CASGEVY, significantly broadening the eligible SCD and TDT patient population. We are also investigating in vivo gene-editing approaches and small molecules for the potential treatment of SCD and TDT.\nPain\nPain can be debilitating and develop from a variety of conditions. Most commonly, patients with pain can be categorized as suffering from one of three types of pain: acute pain, chronic neuropathic pain (caused primarily by damage or dysfunction of peripheral nerves), or chronic musculoskeletal pain (caused primarily by damage to muscle, joints or bone). Acute pain usually resolves in days or weeks (for example, following surgery or an injury), while chronic pain generally lasts greater \nthan three months due to unresolved or ongoing damage to tissues or nerves. Currently available treatments have limitations around efficacy or side effects, including a risk of addiction. Because of these challenges, over- and under-utilization, as well as mis-utilization, of current pain medicines may occur. \nThe sodium channels NaV1.8 and NaV1.7 play important roles in the physiology of pain. We have discovered multiple selective small molecule inhibitors of NaV1.8 as potential treatments for pain. We obtained pharmacological validation of NaV1.8 inhibition with a first generation NaV1.8 inhibitor in three clinical pain types: acute pain, chronic neuropathic pain, and chronic musculoskeletal pain. \nIn acute pain, we are evaluating an oral formulation of VX-993, our next-generation NaV1.8 pain signal inhibitor, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain following bunionectomy surgery in a Phase 2 clinical trial. We are also enrolling and dosing healthy volunteers in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating an intravenous formulation of VX-993. The FDA has granted Fast Track Designation to VX-993 in acute pain in both the oral and intravenous formulations. \nIn neuropathic pain, we are enrolling and dosing in the Phase 3 pivotal program evaluating suzetrigine in people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common form of peripheral neuropathic pain, with the ultimate goal of securing a broad label for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. In addition, we are enrolling and dosing patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the oral formulation of VX-993, for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. There are no approved medicines in the U.S. that are labeled for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. The FDA has granted suzetrigine Breakthrough Therapy Designation in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. \nIn support of this broad peripheral neuropathic pain indication we seek, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of suzetrigine for the treatment of people with LSR, which is pain caused by impairment or injury to nerve roots in the area of the lumbar spine, another type of peripheral neuropathic pain. In December 2024, we announced Phase 2 clinical trial results showing that treatment with suzetrigine demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful within-group reduction in pain on the numeric pain rating scale for people with LSR, and that suzetrigine was safe and generally well-tolerated in the trial. The clinical trial also included a placebo reference arm, which showed a similar within-group reduction. We hypothesize that a high placebo response in this clinical trial led to a lack of separation of the suzetrigine and placebo response curves. We believe we can innovate in pain clinical trial design to better control the placebo effect, and succeed in pivotal development with suzetrigine. We plan to advance suzetrigine into pivotal development in LSR, pending discussions with regulators on trial design and the regulatory package.\nIn keeping with our serial innovation approach, we are advancing multiple additional NaV1.8 inhibitors and NaV1.7 inhibitors, which could be used alone or in combination, for the treatment of acute pain and chronic neuropathic pain.\nAPOL1-Mediated Kidney Disease \nInherited mutations in the APOL1 gene play a causal role in the biology of severe proteinuric kidney diseases referred to as AMKD. In AMKD, the kidney’s filtering units known as the glomeruli, and within them the cells known as podocytes, are damaged, leading to leakage of protein into the urine, deterioration in kidney function, scarring, and, ultimately, permanent kidney damage. Patients with proteinuria who inherited two copies of the APOL1 mutations demonstrate rapid progression to end-stage kidney disease. Some patients with AMKD have the histological finding of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (“FSGS”) and co-morbidities such as hypertension. We are evaluating multiple novel small molecules that inhibit the function of the mutant APOL1 protein with the potential to treat APOL1-mediated kidney disease.\nIn a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial, patients with APOL1-mediated FSGS treated with inaxaplin on top of standard of care achieved a statistically significant, substantial, and clinically meaningful reduction of proteinuria, and inaxaplin was well tolerated by patients. Based on this positive Phase 2 data, we initiated pivotal development of inaxaplin in a single Phase 2/3 adaptive clinical trial in patients with AMKD in 2022. We completed the Phase 2B portion of the Phase 2/3 clinical trial and initiated the Phase 3 portion of the study in 2024. We continue to enroll and dose people with AMKD in the Phase 3 portion of the global Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial (“AMPLITUDE”). We expect to complete enrollment in the interim analysis cohort in 2025 and apply for potential accelerated approval in the U.S., assuming a positive interim analysis.\nIn addition, we have initiated a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial (“AMPLIFIED”) evaluating inaxaplin as a treatment for people with AMKD and diabetes or other co-morbidities currently not eligible for the AMPLITUDE trial.\nIgA Nephropathy and Other B Cell-Mediated Diseases\nIgAN is a serious, progressive, life-threatening chronic kidney disease that causes inflammation and damage to the kidneys. It is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, affecting approximately 300,000 people in the U.S. and Europe, and, in China, there are approximately 750,000 people diagnosed with IgAN. A high percentage of people with IgAN progress to end-stage kidney disease. While there are approved therapies for the treatment of IgAN, there are no approved therapies that specifically target the underlying cause of the disease. \nIgAN is thought to occur when the body produces an abnormal form of IgA, a type of antibody that normally helps the body fight infections. The body generates an abnormal immune response, including antibodies (autoantibodies), against this abnormal IgA, and these antibodies can combine to create larger molecules called immune complexes. These immune complexes can deposit in the kidneys, triggering damage and inflammation, especially within the glomeruli, impairing the kidneys’ ability to properly filter waste and fluid. \nIn 2024, we acquired Alpine and its lead asset, povetacicept, which has the potential of being a “pipeline-in-a-product.” Povetacicept is a dual antagonist of BAFF and APRIL, which play key roles in pathogenesis of IgAN and multiple other autoimmune diseases via their roles in the activation, differentiation and/or survival of B cells, T cells and innate immune cells. Povetacicept is a protein therapeutic based upon an engineered TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor) domain. It has demonstrated higher binding affinity and greater potency in preclinical studies versus other inhibitors of BAFF and/or APRIL and has demonstrated potential best-in-class efficacy in a clinical trial in people with IgAN. Povetacicept is being studied as a once every four weeks subcutaneous injection, with the aim of at home self-administration upon commercialization.\nIn 2024, we initiated RAINIER, our global Phase 3 pivotal trial of povetacicept versus placebo in approximately 480 people with IgAN, which is enrolling and dosing people in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The clinical trial design contemplates a pre-planned interim analysis evaluating the change from baseline in urine protein-to-creatine ratio (“UPCR”) after a certain number of patients reach 36 weeks of treatment. If positive, the interim analysis may serve as the basis to seek accelerated approval in the U.S. The final analysis will occur when patients reach two years of treatment and will evaluate total eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) slope. We expect to complete enrollment in the interim analysis cohort in 2025 and apply for potential accelerated approval in the U.S., assuming a positive interim analysis.\nIn January 2025, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai Lab Limited (“Zai”) for the development and commercialization of povetacicept in mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, Taiwan region and Singapore. Under this collaboration, Zai will help advance the povetacicept clinical trials and make the regulatory submissions in the licensed territories. Zai will also be responsible for commercialization activities in the licensed territories, if povetacicept becomes an approved product. \nWe believe povetacicept holds the potential to transform multiple B-cell mediated diseases and deliver on its potential as a pipeline-in-a-product, with significant market opportunity across multiple therapeutic areas. In addition to IgAN, we are evaluating povetacicept as a treatment for other B cell-mediated autoimmune kidney diseases in the RUBY-3 basket trial and as a treatment for autoimmune cytopenias in the RUBY-4 basket trial. Both of these basket trials are ongoing, and we expect data in some of these conditions in 2025. \nType 1 Diabetes\nT1D is a chronic metabolic disorder caused by insufficient insulin secretion by the beta cells in the pancreas. In patients with T1D, the insulin-producing islet cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the person’s own immune system, resulting in a lack of insulin and impairment of blood glucose control. While insulin therapy allows patients to live for decades with the disease, challenges of insulin therapy include inadequate control of blood sugar (both hyper- and hypo-glycemia), a substantial burden of care on patients and families, and long-term vascular complications. Current standards of care do not address the underlying causes of the disease, and there are limited treatment options beyond insulin for the management of T1D.\nWe are developing non-autologous (allogeneic) fully differentiated, stem-cell derived islet cell therapies designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells that are destroyed in people with T1D, with the goal of delivering a functional cure. We are pursuing multiple programs for the transplant of functional islets into patients, including: transplantation of islet cells alone followed by standard, chronic immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, implantation of the islet cells inside a \nnovel immunoprotective device, alternative approaches to immunosuppression that could be used with the implanted islet cells, and development of hypoimmune islet cells to optimize protection of the implanted islet cells from the immune system.\nZimislecel, our first program, is a stem cell-derived, allogeneic, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell replacement therapy, using standard immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells. The Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial is designed as a sequential, multi-part clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zimislecel, and has been expanded to include a total of 50 people. We expect to complete enrollment and dosing in the Phase 3 portion of this clinical trial in 2025 and, assuming positive data, we expect to file for approval after patients have completed one year of insulin-free follow-up. Data presented demonstrate unprecedented efficacy and curative potential. Safety data are consistent with the immunosuppressives, the perioperative period, and past medical history. In addition, we have initiated a clinical trial evaluating zimislecel in people with T1D who have had a kidney transplant. \nIn our second program, we are evaluating VX-264, in which zimislecel is encapsulated in an immunoprotective device that is implanted in patients, which we believe can obviate the need for immunosuppressive therapy. We are enrolling and dosing patients with VX-264 in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of VX-264. Part A of the study dosed patients with a partial dose of cells/devices and a stagger between patients, Part B dosed patients with a full target dose and a stagger between patients, and Part C will dose at full target dose without a stagger between patients. We expect to share Part B full-dose data from this clinical trial in 2025.\nIn our third program, research is directed toward developing hypoimmune cells by gene-editing zimislecel prior to differentiation into fully differentiated islets in order to cloak them from the immune system. This program continues to advance in pre-clinical development. We are also pursuing alternative approaches to immunosuppression that could be used with zimislecel.\nMyotonic Dystrophy Type 1 \nDM1 is an inherited disease that results in the weakening and destruction of skeletal muscles over time. Muscle weakness, muscle wasting and myotonia (sustained muscle contraction and difficulty relaxing muscles) are the hallmark features of DM1. It is a serious life-shortening disease with no approved treatments. \nVX-670, our lead approach for DM1, holds the potential to address the underlying cause of DM1. VX-670 is an oligonucleotide connected to a cyclic peptide to promote effective delivery into cells. We completed the single ascending dose portion of the global Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating the first candidate, VX-670, in patients with DM1. We are enrolling and dosing the multiple ascending dose portion of the trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-670. We also have a small molecule program for DM1 in preclinical development. \nAutosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease\nADPKD is a life-shortening genetic kidney disease characterized by the growth of numerous kidney-enlarging cysts that impair kidney function and can ultimately lead to kidney failure, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation, and premature death. Kidney cysts can also lead to severe abdominal pain, cyst infection, blood in the urine and kidney stones, all of which significantly impair quality of life. Around half of patients with ADPKD experience kidney failure by the age of 60.\nVX-407 is a first-in-class small molecule corrector that is designed to target the underlying cause of ADPKD in people with a subset of PKD1 variants. We are nearing completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers evaluating VX-407 and expect to advance VX-407 into a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in people with ADPKD in 2025.\nCOMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR MEDICINES\nOur commercialization efforts focus on supporting the appropriate use of ALYFTREK, TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, ORKAMBI, KALYDECO, CASGEVY and JOURNAVX in the markets where these products have been approved. Our teams are responsible for promoting products to health care providers, ensuring our products are distributed effectively, ensuring the safe use of our products, and obtaining reimbursement for our products from third-party payors, including governmental organizations in the U.S. and ex-U.S. markets. In parallel, our government affairs and public \npolicy group advocates for policies that promote life sciences innovation and increase awareness of the diseases on which we are focusing with state and federal legislatures, government agencies, public health officials and other policymakers. \nCommercialization of CF Medicines \nIn the U.S., we primarily sell our CF products to a limited number of specialty pharmacy and specialty distributors. In international markets, we sell our CF products primarily through distributor arrangements and to retail pharmacies, as well as to hospitals and clinics, many of which are government-owned or supported. We also have established programs in the U.S. that provide our CF products to qualified uninsured or underinsured patients at no charge or at a reduced charge, based on specific eligibility criteria. \nOur U.S. field-based CF commercial team is comprised of a small number of individuals to support commercialization of our medicines for CF. We focus our CF marketing efforts in the U.S. on a relatively small number of physicians and health care professionals who write most of the prescriptions for CF medicines. Many of these physicians and health care professionals are located at a limited number of accredited centers in the U.S. focused on the treatment of CF. In international markets, we or our distributors have small sales forces that support TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, ORKAMBI and KALYDECO in jurisdictions where these products are approved. \nIn December 2024, the FDA approved ALYFTREK in the U.S. as a treatment for people with CF 6 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation or another mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ALYFTREK. This includes people with CF with one of 31 mutations who are now eligible for a CFTR modulator for the first time. ALYFTREK demonstrated non-inferiority to TRIKAFTA in ppFEV1, a measure of lung function, and an improvement in sweat chloride levels as compared to TRIKAFTA, and we believe that this medicine has the potential to improve the care of patients with CF. ALYFTREK has the additional benefit of a once-daily dosing regimen and may lead to a new standard in CF care, reinforcing our established position as the leading company in CF. In addition, this new triple combination regimen has a lower royalty burden than our other CF medicines. We believe ALYFTREK presents an opportunity for three types of patients: (i) those who are currently on a CFTR modulator who may want to switch to ALYFTREK, (ii) those patients who have not yet been initiated on a CFTR modulator or been eligible for a CFTR modulator, and (iii) those who have discontinued from another CFTR modulator. We are supporting the launch of ALYFTREK through our existing commercial infrastructure.\nALYFTREK is under regulatory review in the U.K., the E.U., Canada, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand. \nAdditionally, in December 2024, the FDA approved the expanded use of TRIKAFTA for the treatment of people with CF 2 years of age and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene or a mutation that is responsive to TRIKAFTA based on clinical and/or in vitro data. With this approval, 94 additional non-F508del CFTR mutations have been added to the TRIKAFTA label, and approximately 300 additional people with CF in the U.S. are now eligible to receive TRIKAFTA as a treatment.\nCommercialization of CASGEVY\nWe are continuing the commercial launch of CASGEVY, following approvals in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Canada and Switzerland. We expect to obtain additional regulatory approvals for CASGEVY in 2025. We estimate approximately 60,000 people with severe SCD and TDT are or could become eligible for CASGEVY in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.\nAs CASGEVY is the first CRISPR-based therapy to be approved, our global launch strategy is focused on educating physicians, patients and caregivers, payors, and policymakers about the significant disease burden of SCD and TDT and the availability of CASGEVY as a treatment option. We have also established a global manufacturing network to ensure adequate production and supply of CASGEVY at commercial scale. Given the geographic concentration of patients, we expect to reach the majority of patients through our specialty commercial model, which is comprised of a small number of field-based individuals. Because the administration of CASGEVY requires specialized experience in stem cell transplantation, we are engaging with experienced hospitals to establish a network of authorized treatment centers across the U.S., Europe and the Middle East. We have activated more than 50 authorized treatment centers across the U.S., Europe, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE, and we are working to activate additional centers.\n Our teams are actively engaged with key treatment centers, policymakers and third-party payors to ensure that patients who may be eligible for CASGEVY have access to this potentially curative therapy. We are seeking broad access with \ngovernment and commercial payors for CASGEVY. In the U.S., there is broad coverage of CASGEVY in the private and public payer space, initially through single case agreements as medical policies are finalized. In addition, we have recently reached an agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to participate in its cell and gene therapy access model, which may enable additional access mechanisms for states and authorized treatment centers. In England, we have secured access for eligible people with TDT and SCD. In the E.U., we are working with national health authorities to achieve access and reimbursement and have secured reimbursed access for people with SCD or TDT in Luxembourg, we have established a hospital-based reimbursement for CASGEVY in Austria, and the Italian Medicines Agency has approved early access for CASGEVY, on a case-by-case basis, to treat people with TDT or SCD. In the Middle East, we have reached a hospital-based reimbursement for people with SCD or TDT in Saudi Arabia, and for national reimbursement for eligible people in Bahrain. We are actively working to expand access to CASGEVY across Europe and the Middle East. \nWe are currently treating patients across multiple geographies and more than 50 patients have initiated cell collection. The first commercial patient was infused with CASGEVY in the third quarter of 2024. \nCommercialization of JOURNAVX\nIn January 2025, JOURNAVX was approved by the FDA as a treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe acute pain. We believe JOURNAVX has the potential to establish a new standard of care for the estimated 80 million patients in the U.S. who are prescribed a medicine for their acute pain each year. Approximately half of these patients are prescribed opioids, which, while effective, have significant safety and tolerability concerns, and addictive potential. JOURNAVX provides effective relief of moderate-to-severe acute pain, has a favorable safety and tolerability profile, and based on its mechanism of action, does not have addictive potential.\nOur commercial focus at launch for JOURNAVX is securing broad access and investing to ensure a seamless experience for patients and physicians. We are engaging with key health care professionals, formulary decision makers and payers to establish the conditions for rapid patient access and uptake. Our commercial field team is engaging stakeholders to support the launch of JOURNAVX in hospitals and other healthcare settings in the U.S. In addition, we are working to secure broad stocking agreements with national retail pharmacies and regional chains, to ensure access to JOURNAVX for patients across the U.S.\nWe are also focused on ensuring there is equal access to non-opioid options for pain relief. We continue to see momentum from federal and state policymakers to support the appropriate use of non-opioid pain medications, including addressing financial and other administrative barriers, such as utilization management, to accessing non-opioid options. In addition, as a part of our commitment to patients, we are offering financial and copay support programs for eligible patients who are prescribed JOURNAVX. \nReimbursement of Approved Therapies\nOur CF medicines are used by patients in more than 60 countries, and TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO is reimbursed or accessible in more than 50 of these countries outside the U.S. We expect to continue to focus significant resources to maintain reimbursement and obtain expanded reimbursement for our CF medicines and pipeline therapies in ex-U.S. markets. \nIn SCD and TDT, CASGEVY is approved in the U.S., the E.U., the U.K., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Canada and Switzerland, and we are actively engaged with relevant stakeholders to obtain broad access and reimbursement with government and commercial payors for CASGEVY. CASGEVY is broadly reimbursed by third-party payors in the U.S., including the federal government. Currently in the U.S., across commercial and government payors, all eligible CASGEVY patients have case-by-case coverage through single case agreements, and we have signed agreements with national and regional payors, which cover over 250 million lives, to provide access to CASGEVY. Within Medicare, to help address this issue, we applied for and CMS has granted a new technology add-on payment for CASGEVY when used for the treatment of SCD for Medicare patients. Within Medicaid, we have engaged all of the Medicaid administrators in all 50 U.S. states, focused on the 25 states with the highest prevalence of SCD patients, and have confirmed pathways to reimbursement in all 25 of those priority states. In addition, in February 2023, the U.S. Administration established a new demonstration program to help pay for cell and gene therapies in diseases such as SCD through the CMS program known as The Cell and Gene Therapy Access Model (“CGT Access Model”). The CGT Access Model was designed to provide an opportunity to accelerate and enhance broad Medicaid access for eligible patients across all 50 U.S. states by allowing state Medicaid agencies to delegate authority to CMS to coordinate and facilitate outcomes-based payment arrangements (“OBAs”) with cell and gene therapy \nmanufacturers, such as ours. In December 2024, we reached an agreement with CMS to expand access by participating in the CGT Access Model for SCD to benefit Medicaid beneficiaries. \nFor CASGEVY in ex-U.S. markets, we anticipate some early access programs initially and in parallel we are pursuing long-term reimbursement arrangements. We have successfully achieved national reimbursement in England, Luxembourg, and Bahrain for people with TDT or SCD, and secured hospital-based reimbursement for patients in Saudi Arabia and Austria. We continue to engage with payors in the U.K., the E.U., and the Middle East. \nFor JOURNAVX in the U.S., we have been working with government and commercial payors pre- and post-approval to support rapid and broad access, including to accelerate targeted contracting and formulary additions at both select payors and targeted hospital systems. In addition, we are finalizing contracts with private and government payors, as well as hospital group purchasing organizations.\nSTRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS AND COLLABORATIONS\nAs part of our business strategy, we seek to license or acquire technologies, products, product candidates, and businesses that are aligned with our corporate and research and development strategies and complement and advance our ongoing research and development efforts. In addition, we establish business relationships with collaborators to support our research activities and to lead or support development and/or commercialization of certain product candidates. We expect to continue to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions, licenses and collaborations that may be similar or different from the transactions that we have engaged in previously.\nStrategic Transactions\nIn May 2024, we acquired Alpine for approximately $5.0 billion. Alpine’s lead molecule, povetacicept, is a highly potent and effective dual antagonist of BAFF and APRIL. We are evaluating povetacicept for the potential treatment of IgAN in a Phase 3 clinical trial and for the treatment of other serious autoimmune diseases in Phase 2 clinical trials. We believe povetacicept has the potential to treat multiple diseases or conditions and become a pipeline-in-a-product, with significant market opportunity across multiple therapeutic areas. \nIn addition to Alpine, we have made additional acquisitions which have expanded and advanced our pipeline, including: \n•In 2017, we enhanced our CF portfolio through our acquisition of certain CF assets, including deutivacaftor, from Concert Pharmaceuticals Inc. In December 2024, the FDA approved ALYFTREK (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor) for people with CF 6 years of age and older. \n•In 2019, we established our T1D program through our acquisition of Semma, a privately held company focused on the use of stem cell-derived human islets as a potentially curative treatment for T1D. We are evaluating zimislecel for the potential treatment of T1D in a Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial. We expect to complete enrollment and dosing in the Phase 3 portion of this clinical trial in 2025. In addition, our second clinical program in T1D, VX-264, in which zimislecel is encapsulated in an immunoprotective device, is ongoing.\nWe expect to continue to identify and make acquisitions to expand and advance our pipeline and business. \nCollaboration and Licensing Arrangements\nJoint Development and Commercialization Agreement with CRISPR\nIn December 2017, we entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement (“Original JDCA”) with CRISPR, pursuant to which we are co-developing and co-commercializing CASGEVY for SCD and TDT. We entered into the Original JDCA following our exercise of an option to co-develop and co-commercialize the hemoglobinopathies program that was contained in the collaboration agreement that we entered into with CRISPR in 2015. \nIn April 2021, we and CRISPR amended and restated the Original JDCA (the “A&R JDCA”). Pursuant to the A&R JDCA, the parties agreed to, among other things, (a) adjust the governance structure for the collaboration and adjust the responsibilities of each party thereunder; (b) adjust the allocation of net profits and net losses between the parties; and (c) \nexclusively license (subject to CRISPR’s reserved rights to conduct certain activities) certain intellectual property rights to us relating to the products that may be researched, developed, manufactured and commercialized under such agreement. \nPursuant to the A&R JDCA, we lead global development, manufacturing and commercialization of CASGEVY, with support from CRISPR. Subject to the terms and conditions of the A&R JDCA, we have the right to conduct all research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities relating to the product candidates and products under the A&R JDCA (including CASGEVY) throughout the world, subject to CRISPR’s reserved right to conduct certain activities.\nIn connection with the A&R JDCA, we made a $900.0 million upfront payment to CRISPR in the second quarter of 2021. CRISPR earned an additional one-time $200.0 million milestone payment upon receipt of marketing approval of CASGEVY from the FDA.\nWe and CRISPR shared equally all expenses incurred under the Original JDCA. On July 1, 2021, with respect to CASGEVY, the net profits and net losses incurred pursuant to the A&R JDCA began to be allocated 60% to us and 40% to CRISPR, subject to certain adjustments, while all other product candidates and products continue to have net profits and net losses shared equally between the parties. \nEither party may terminate the A&R JDCA upon the other party’s material breach, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or, in our case, in the event that CRISPR becomes subject to specified bankruptcy, winding up, or similar circumstances. Either party may terminate the A&R JDCA in the event the other party commences or participates in any action or proceeding challenging the validity or enforceability of any patent that is licensed to such challenging party pursuant to the A&R JDCA. We also have the right to terminate the A&R JDCA for convenience at any time after giving prior written notice. If circumstances arise pursuant to which a party would have the right to terminate the A&R JDCA on account of an uncured material breach, such party may elect to keep the A&R JDCA in effect and cause such breaching party to be treated as if it had exercised its opt-out rights with respect to the products associated with such uncured material breach and the royalties payable to the breaching party would be reduced by a specified percentage.\nEither party may opt out of the development of a product candidate under the A&R JDCA after predetermined points in the development of the product candidate, on a candidate-by-candidate basis. In the event of such opt-out, the party opting-out will no longer share in the net profits and net losses associated with such product candidate and, instead, the opting out party will be entitled to high single to mid-teen percentage royalties on the net sales of such product, if commercialized.\nIn-License Agreements\nWe have entered into various agreements pursuant to which we have obtained access to technologies from third parties and are conducting research and development activities with collaborators. Pursuant to these arrangements, we have obtained development and commercialization rights to resulting product candidates. Depending on the terms of the arrangements, we may be responsible for the costs of research activities, required to make upfront payments and/or milestone payments upon the achievement of certain research, development, and commercial objectives, and/or pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products resulting from the collaboration. Our current in-license agreements include:\n•CRISPR Therapeutics AG. In addition to our arrangement with CRISPR described above, we have exercised options to exclusively license treatments for specific targets, including CF, that were subject to the research program under the collaboration agreement we entered into with CRISPR in 2015. In 2019, we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to CRISPR’s intellectual property for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) and DM1 gene-editing products through a new agreement with CRISPR. In 2023, we obtained non-exclusive rights to CRISPR’s intellectual property for the development of hypoimmune gene-edited cell therapies for T1D through a new agreement with CRISPR.\n•Moderna, Inc. In 2016, we entered into a collaboration with Moderna for the identification and development of mRNA therapeutics encoding CFTR for the treatment of CF. In December 2022, the FDA cleared our Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for VX-522, an mRNA therapeutic we are developing with Moderna pursuant to this collaboration. The multiple ascending dose portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of VX-522 in people with CF is ongoing. We expect to share data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2025.\n•Entrada Therapeutics, Inc. In 2022, we established a collaboration with Entrada focused on enabling efficient intracellular delivery of an oligonucleotide for DM1. This collaboration includes VX-670, an investigational candidate for the treatment of DM1 that is in clinical development. We completed the single ascending dose portion \nof the global Phase 1/2 clinical trial for VX-670 in people with DM1. We are enrolling and dosing the multiple ascending dose portion of the trial, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-670.\nOut-license Agreements\nWe have entered into various agreements pursuant to which we have out-licensed rights to certain product candidates to third-party collaborators. Pursuant to these out-license arrangements, our collaborators are responsible for all costs related to the continued development of such product candidates and obtain development and commercialization rights to these product candidates. Depending on the terms of the arrangements, our collaborators may be required to make upfront payments, milestone payments upon the achievement of certain research and development objectives and/or pay royalties on future sales, if any, of commercial products licensed under the agreement. \nIn January 2025, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai for the development and commercialization of povetacicept in mainland China, Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR, Taiwan region and Singapore. Under this collaboration, Zai will help advance the povetacicept clinical trials and make the regulatory submissions in the licensed territories. Zai will also be responsible for commercialization activities in the licensed territories, if povetacicept becomes an approved product. \nCystic Fibrosis Foundation\nIn 2004, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, as successor in interest to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., to support research and development activities. Pursuant to the collaboration agreement, as amended, we have agreed to pay tiered royalties ranging from single digits to sub-teens on covered compounds first synthesized and/or tested during a research term on or before February 28, 2014, including ivacaftor, lumacaftor and tezacaftor and royalties ranging from low-single digits to mid-single digits on net sales of certain compounds first synthesized and/or tested between March 1, 2014 and August 31, 2016, including elexacaftor. We do not have any royalty obligations on compounds first synthesized and tested on or after September 1, 2016. For combination products, such as ORKAMBI, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, and ALYFTREK sales are allocated equally to each of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in the combination product, and royalties are then paid for any royalty-bearing components included in the combination.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nPatents and other intellectual property rights such as trademarks, trade secrets, and copyrights are critical to our business. We actively seek protection for our products and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, and copyrights, as appropriate. In addition, we rely upon trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information.\nPatents provide a period of exclusivity that can make it more difficult for competitors to market and use our technology. We own and control patents and pending patent applications that relate to compounds, formulations, synthetic routes, intermediates, devices, treatment of diseases, and other inventions.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we typically apply for patents several years before a product receives marketing approval. Under current law, a patent expires 20 years from its first effective filing date. Since the drug development process may last for many years, there may be a period of time in which we have an issued patent but not marketing approval to sell the drug. To compensate for patent term lost while a product is in clinical trials and undergoing review for marketing approval, we may be able to apply for patent term extensions or supplementary protection certificates (“SPCs”) in some countries. In addition to patent protection, we receive regulatory exclusivity from U.S. and European regulatory agencies for the active pharmaceutical and biological agents and, where applicable, their approved orphan indications for a certain time period. Regulatory exclusivity runs concurrently with patent exclusivity and provides complementary protection for our products.\nFor our approved commercial products, and those in development, we own or hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to several hundred patents around the world. In the U.S., once an NDA, or a supplement thereto, is approved we are required to list with the FDA each U.S. patent with claims that cover our product or a method of using the product. The FDA publishes the patents we list in a book referred to as the Orange Book. We have thirteen issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in KALYDECO, its marketed formulations, and/or its approved indication. \nWe have 22 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in ORKAMBI, its marketed formulations, and/or its approved indication. We have 25 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in SYMDEKO, its marketed formulation, and/or its approved indication. We have 28 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in TRIKAFTA, its marketed formulation, and/or its approved indication. We have 35 issued U.S. patents listed in the Orange Book that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredients in ALYFTREK, its marketed formulation, and/or its approved indication. We expect to have an issued patent listed in the Orange Book that covers the active pharmaceutical ingredient in JOURNAVX, its marketed formulation, and/or its approved indication.\nProducts approved by the FDA under a Biologics Licensing Application (“BLA”), including CASGEVY, receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. from a product’s approval date. Additionally, we have licenses to dozens of issued U.S. patents that cover CASGEVY, its approved indication, and/or its manufacture. Products approved by the FDA under a BLA are not subject to the Orange Book patent listing requirement.\nThe table below sets forth the year of projected expiration for the basic product patent covering each of our approved products. For products that are combinations of two or more active ingredients, the table lists the projected expiration of the latest expiring patent covering any of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (lumacaftor for ORKAMBI, tezacaftor for SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, elexacaftor for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO and vanzacaftor for ALYFTREK). Unless otherwise noted, patent term extensions, and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below and may extend protection. In some instances, we also own later-expiring patents and applications relating to solid forms, formulations, methods of manufacture, or the use of these drugs in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. In some cases, however, such patents may not protect our drug from generic competition after the expiration of the basic patent.\n\nProduct                                   Expiration Year                        Expiration Year\n                             of U.S. Basic Product Patent       of European Basic Product Patent\nKALYDECO                                             2027                                   2027\nORKAMBI                                              2031                                 2030 1\nSYMDEKO/SYMKEVI                                      2027                                 2033 1\nTRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO                                     2037                                   2037\nCASGEVY                                              2035                              2034 3, 4\nALYFTREK                                             2039                                   2039\nJOURNAVX                                             2040                                   2040\n1 Expiration date reflects SPCs granted in the five major European markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.).\n2 Expiration year reflects the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, which expires later than the basic product patent for this product in this market.\n3 Expiration year reflects the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in the E.U., which expires later than the basic product patent for this product in this market. \n4 Product is approved in Great Britain with regulatory exclusivity until November 2033, which is later than the expiration of the basic product patent.\nIn addition to protecting our marketed products, we actively file patent applications in the U.S. and in foreign countries on inventions relating to our pipeline. For example, we also own and/or control U.S. and foreign patents and/or patent applications relating to the following:\n•Other CF potentiators and correctors and many other related compounds, and the use of those compounds for the treatment CF.\n•VX-522 and other mRNA-based approaches for treating CF.\n•VX-993, VX-973, and other compounds being studied for the potential treatment of pain. \n•Inaxaplin and other compounds being studied for the potential treatment of AMKD.\n•Povetacicept for the treatment of IgAN.\n•Zimislecel, VX-264, and other cell-based approaches for treating T1D.\n•VX-670 for the treatment of DM1.\n•VX-407 and other compounds being studied for the potential treatment of ADPKD.\n•Other pre-clinical and clinical candidates and the use of such candidates to treat specified diseases.\n•The manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions, related solid forms, formulations, dosing regimens, and methods of use of many of the above compounds.\nWe and CRISPR intend to rely upon a combination of rights, including patent rights, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivities to protect CASGEVY. CRISPR has licensed certain rights to a worldwide patent portfolio that covers various aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 editing platform technology including, for example, compositions of matter and methods of use, including their use in targeting or cutting DNA, from Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier. In addition to Dr. Charpentier, this patent portfolio has named inventors who assigned their rights to the Regents of the University of California or the University of Vienna, to whom we refer, together with Dr. Charpentier, as the CVC Group. CRISPR has non-exclusive or co-exclusive rights to the patent rights that protect the core CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. For example, certain third parties, including competitors, have reported obtaining a license to rights in this patent portfolio in certain fields. In addition, patents and patent applications in this patent portfolio are the subject of adversarial proceedings in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions, including proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”), between the CVC Group and, separately, Sigma-Aldrich, Co. LLC (“Sigma-Aldrich”), ToolGen, Inc. (“ToolGen”), and the Broad Institute, Harvard University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (collectively, “Broad”). To date, both the CVC Group and Broad have obtained granted patents that purport to cover aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 editing platform technology. The patents and patent applications within the patent portfolios of the CVC Group, Broad, Sigma-Aldrich and/or ToolGen are, or may in the future be, involved in proceedings similar to interferences or priority disputes in Europe or other foreign jurisdictions. In December 2023, we entered into an agreement with Editas Medicine, Inc. (“Editas”), providing us a non-exclusive sublicense to certain patents relating to CRISPR/Cas9 technology, owned by Broad and Harvard, which are licensed to Editas. In addition to the patent portfolios licensed from Dr. Charpentier, Broad, and Harvard, we own patents and/or patent applications relating to the composition, manufacture, and use of CASGEVY.\nFrom time to time, we enter into exclusive and non-exclusive license agreements for proprietary third-party technology used in connection with our research activities. These license agreements typically provide for the payment by us of a license fee but may also include terms providing for milestone payments or royalties for the development and/or commercialization of our drug products arising from the related research.\nWe cannot be certain that issued patents we own or license will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. The existence of patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain patents, regulatory exclusivities or other proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of intellectual property rights that may be claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. \nMANUFACTURING \nAs we market and sell our approved products and advance our product candidates through clinical development toward commercialization, we continue to build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources. We rely on internal capabilities and a global network of third parties to manufacture and distribute our product candidates for clinical trials, as well as our products for commercial sale and post-approval clinical trials. In addition to establishing supply chains for each new approved product, we must adapt our supply chain for existing products to include additional formulations that are often required to treat younger patients or to increase scale of production for existing products. We are focused on ensuring the stability of the supply chains for our current products, including KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, ALYFTREK, CASGEVY, JOURNAVX, and for our pipeline programs. In addition, we are focused on identifying and ensuring efficient manufacturing and delivery processes for the biological and cell and genetic therapies we are developing, including our stem cell therapy program for T1D and biologics manufacturing for povetacicept and other product candidates.\nWe have established our own small molecule manufacturing capabilities in Boston, which we use for clinical trial and commercial supplies, including certain manufacturing steps related to our commercial supply of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO. We expect to continue to rely on third parties to meet our commercial supply needs, including for TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, CASGEVY, ALYFTREK, JOURNAVX, and pipeline programs, and a significant portion of our clinical supply needs for the foreseeable future. We have established and continue to evaluate additional manufacturing capacity for our current and future products, including recently approved ALYFTREK for CF, and JOURNAVX for pain.\nOur supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing our product and product candidates, including obtaining all necessary supplies, is a multi-step global endeavor. In general, these raw materials and other necessary supplies are available from multiple sources. Third-party contract manufacturers, including some in China, perform different parts of our manufacturing process. Contract manufacturers supply us with raw materials, convert these raw materials into drug substance and/or convert the drug substance or product into final dosage form. In addition, third parties assist us with packaging, warehousing, and global distribution of our products. Establishing and managing this global supply chain for each of our products and product candidates require a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships. \nThe manufacturing processes for biological and cell and genetic therapies are more complex than those required for small molecule drugs and require different systems, equipment, facilities, and expertise. Additionally, we are unable to utilize a single process for all of our biological and cell and genetic therapies; they must be customized for each program and therapy. We are investing and plan to continue to invest significant resources in expanding and strengthening our manufacturing, infrastructure and capabilities, such as cGMP clinical manufacturing, both independently and through third-party networks, in an effort to develop and commercialize our biological and cell and genetic therapies. We have secured agreements for povetacicept and our T1D cell therapy program to meet our anticipated demands. We continue to evaluate additional suppliers for all of our late-stage clinical programs for additional capacity and redundancy to support commercial supply. \nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to produce or process cell culture reagents and gene-editing components, such as Cas9 protein and guide RNA molecules for clinical trials and commercial supply of CASGEVY, and to generate gene-edited cells to supply CASGEVY. We continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial supply of CASGEVY. The manufacturing process for CASGEVY involves a number of steps prior to the final infusion of drug product into patients. Following mobilization and collection of blood cells from the patient, cells are transferred to a manufacturing site where HSPCs are purified and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing is performed. The edited cellular product, called CASGEVY, is frozen and transported back to the authorized treatment center where it is stored prior to infusion into the patient. Each step must be completed successfully, and in a timely manner, requiring coordination between us, authorized treatment centers, third-party manufacturers and shipping vendors. We are making significant investments to secure additional capacity and to coordinate manufacturing, testing, and logistics activities at a larger scale across multiple facilities to serve the geographies in which we are treating and expect to treat additional patients with CASGEVY.\nWe have established manufacturing capabilities in the Boston area to support our T1D program. In addition, to further expand our capabilities in cell therapy manufacturing, we have a strategic agreement with Lonza to support the manufacture of our portfolio of investigational allogeneic stem cell-derived, fully differentiated, insulin-producing islet cell therapies. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to produce drug substance and finished drug product for clinical trials for povetacicept. \nWe have developed systems and processes to track, monitor, and oversee our and our third-party manufacturers’ activities, including a quality assurance program intended to ensure that our third-party manufacturers comply with cGMP and the foreign jurisdictional equivalents when applicable. We devote substantial time, resources and effort in the areas of production, quality control, and quality assurance to maintain cGMP compliance. We regularly evaluate the performance of our third-party manufacturers with the objective of confirming their continuing capabilities to meet our needs efficiently and economically. Manufacturing facilities, both foreign and domestic, are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and other U.S. and foreign government authorities. Although we actively engage with regulatory authorities, the timing of inspections and regulatory approvals for each of these facilities is the remit of the manufacturer and not within our control and may be delayed for a number of reasons.\nCOMPETITION\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive research efforts, rapid technological progress, and intense competition. There are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our drugs are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, other public and private research organizations and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in a larger concentration of resources among a smaller number of our competitors. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing and human resources than we do. \nWe believe that competition in our industry is based on, among other factors, innovative research, the effective and rapid development of product candidates, the ability to market and obtain reimbursement for products and the ability to establish effective patent protection. We face competition based on the safety and efficacy of our product and product candidates, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability and cost of supply, marketing and sales capabilities, reimbursement coverage, price, patent protection and other factors. Our competitors may develop or commercialize more effective, safer, or more affordable products than we are able to develop or commercialize or obtain more effective patent protection. As a result, our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we do, which would adversely affect our competitive position, the likelihood that our product candidates, if approved, would achieve and maintain market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful revenues from our products. Future competitive products may render our products, or future products, obsolete or noncompetitive. Another key element of remaining competitive in our industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientific, technical and management personnel to conduct our research activities and advance our development programs, including with the commercial expertise to effectively market our products. \nOur success in rapidly developing and commercializing our products may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of potential treatments. In addition, clinical trials conducted by our competitors could take place simultaneously with our own trials and may slow down our pace of development if we are unable to recruit sufficient clinical trial subjects. If one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a marketable treatment, our revenues from our current products and/or additional products, if then approved, could face significant competitive pressure.\nMany other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are investing resources for the discovery and development of small molecules and biologic and cell and gene therapies to treat the same disease areas for which we are developing therapies in our pipeline. If any of these competitors develop or successfully commercialize products involving therapies competitive with our pipeline therapies, the potential return on our investment in those pipeline therapies could be impacted.\nCystic Fibrosis\nA number of companies are seeking to identify and develop product candidates for the treatment of CF, including CFTR modulators and other therapies intended to address the underlying causes of CF.\nSionna Therapeutics, Inc. has multiple CFTR modulators in Phase 1 or Phase 2 development, including assets in-licensed from AbbVie Inc. in July 2024, and additional CFTR modulators in preclinical development. Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc. was developing potential CFTR modulator therapies prior to its acquisition by Yumanity Therapeutics, Inc. (“Yumanity”). Following the merger, Yumanity out-licensed the CF program to Fair Therapeutics. In February 2024, HIT-CF Europe, a research project from CF-Europe, a federation of European patient advocacy groups, initiated a Phase 2b trial of a combination of Fair Therapeutics’ CFTR modulators in European CF patients with rare mutations of the CFTR gene. \nOther therapeutic approaches include addressing CF utilizing nucleic acid therapies, which are compounds that allow expression of a functional CFTR protein and are relevant for the more than 5,000 people with CF who cannot make full-length CFTR protein and cannot benefit from CFTR modulators. Nucleic acid therapies are under development by companies such as Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings, Inc., ReCode Therapeutics, Inc., Krystal Biotech, Inc., Spirovant Sciences, Inc. Boehringer Ingelheim International, GmbH, 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Inc and SpliSense, Ltd. \nSickle Cell and Beta Thalassemia\nThere are multiple approved small molecule and biologic treatments for SCD and beta thalassemia, including products from Novartis International AG (“Novartis”), and Bristol Myers Squibb together with Merck & Co. In addition, bluebird bio, \nInc. (“bluebird”) obtained FDA approval of its gene therapy, ZYNTEGLO™ (betibeglogene autotemcel) in August 2022 for the treatment of patients with beta thalassemia who require regular red blood cell transfusions. bluebird withdrew its marketing authorizations for Zynteglo from both the E.U. and U.K. in early 2022. In late 2023, bluebird also obtained FDA approval for its gene therapy for SCD, LYFGENIA™ (lovotibeglogene autotemcel). In September 2024, Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”) voluntarily withdrew OXBRYTA® (voxelotor) from all markets. Authorization for Novartis’ ADAKVEO® (crizanlizumab) has been revoked in the U.K. and in Europe, however, this drug remains approved for use in the U.S. by the FDA.\nVarious companies and private academic/medical institutes are developing therapies for the treatment of SCD or beta thalassemia utilizing CRISPR technology, lentiviral vectors, or transcription activator-like effector nuclease, gene correction, base, or prime editing. For example, Beam Therapeutics has a base-editing asset in clinical development for SCD. In addition, Agios Pharmaceuticals’ Supplemental New Drug Application for PYRUKYND® (mitapivat) is under review in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with non-transfusion dependent and transfusion dependent alpha- or beta thalassemia. Mitapivat is also in Phase 3 for SCD.\nPain\nThe acute pain market largely consists of conventional analgesics, including opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and local anesthetics, low-cost generics, and reformulations aiming to provide safer, more tolerable, or more convenient therapies. Peripheral neuropathic pain is a type of chronic pain caused by injury or dysfunction of peripheral nerves. The peripheral neuropathic pain market largely consists of generic anticonvulsants and anti-depressant drugs.\nSeveral companies are pursuing clinical development of novel mechanisms of action for acute and chronic pain indications, including NaV1.8 inhibitors in Phase 1 clinical trials by Latigo Bio, Merck, and SiteOne Therapeutics. Several additional NaV1.8/1.7 inhibitors are in preclinical development for pain, and there are several other compounds with other mechanisms of action in development, including programs by Eli Lilly and Company (“Eli Lilly”) and Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nT1D\nThe T1D standard of care of exogenous insulin injections continues to progress as multiple companies are developing novel insulin formulations, advanced pumps and glucose sensors, and fully closed loop systems. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are actively engaged in the research and development of products for T1D, including strategies to prevent the destruction of beta cells, to protect beta cell function, or to replace missing beta cells, as well as other cell therapy approaches such as immune evasive technologies to hide the cell from the immune system, micro- and macro-encapsulation technologies that potentially require no immunosuppression, and islets cell in combination with immunosuppression. In addition to CellTrans, Inc.’s LANTIDRA™ (donislecel), the first FDA-approved cadaveric islet therapy for the treatment of T1D, other companies developing cell therapies for T1D, either directly or through partnerships, include Novo Nordisk A/S, Eli Lilly, Sernova Corp, Sana Biotechnology, Inc., Seraxis, Inc., and Evotec A.G.\nAMKD\nThere are no approved therapies for AMKD. People with chronic kidney disease (“CKD”) take angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers to treat hypertension; steroids and immunosuppressants to reduce proteinuria; and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of CKD progression. These CKD treatments may reduce proteinuria, but do not stop the rapid disease progression seen in AMKD patients. Several companies have early programs developing APOL1-targeted assets, including AstraZeneca, Maze Therapeutics, and OmniAb. Eli Lilly’s Janus kinase inhibitor (baricitinib) is being investigated in AMKD patients in a Phase 2 study by Duke University.\nIgAN\nIgAN is a rapidly evolving landscape with multiple potentially disease-modifying therapies in late-stage clinical development. There are three novel therapies for IgAN approved in major markets: Calliditas’ TARPEYO®/KINPEYGO® (delayed release budesonide), Travere Therapeutics’ FILSPARI® (sparsentan), a dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist, and Novartis’ FABHALTA® (iptacopan), a complement factor B inhibitor. Programs in late-stage clinical development include Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd’s sibeprenlimab (anti-APRIL mAb), Vera Therapeutics’ atacicept (dual BAFF/APRIL inhibitor), RemeGen’s telitacicept (dual BAFF/APRIL inhibitor), Novartis’ zigakibart (anti-APRIL mAb), and other programs from Novartis, Roche (and partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals), and AstraZeneca. Other mid-stage clinical \nprograms include anti-CD38 mAbs from Biogen and Takeda. In addition, there is significant global preclinical and earlier stage clinical development activity for IgAN.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nOur operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the U.S., Europe and other countries. In the U.S., Europe and other countries, our products are subject to rigorous regulations governing their testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, and advertising and promotion. As a result of these regulations, product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming. The regulatory requirements applicable to drug and biologic development, approval, and marketing are subject to change. In addition, regulations and administrative guidance often are revised or reinterpreted by the agencies in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA or comparable ex-U.S. regulations, guidance or interpretations will change.\nUnited States Government Regulation\nNew Drug Application and Biologics License Application Approval Processes\nThe process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:\n•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), and other applicable regulations;\n•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials in the U.S. may begin;\n•performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;\n•submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or a BLA;\n•satisfactory completion of a pre-approval FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and\n•FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.\nOnce a drug or biologic is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal pharmacology and toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND, which seeks FDA approval to test the drug or biologic in humans. Preclinical or nonclinical testing typically continues even after the IND is submitted. \nIf the FDA accepts the IND, the drug or biologic can then be studied in human clinical trials to determine if the product candidate is safe and effective. Clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years and are expensive. These three phases, which are subject to considerable regulation, are as follows:\n•Phase 1. The drug or biologic initially is introduced into a limited number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some drugs or biologics for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the drug or biologic may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.\n•Phase 2. Clinical trials are next initiated in a limited patient population with the specified disease or condition the drug or biologic is intended to treat to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug or biologic candidate for the disease or condition it is intended to treat and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.\n•Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the drug or biologic and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling.\nIt is possible that Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period or while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold or suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the healthy volunteers or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, and the occurrence of serious adverse events must also be reported. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.\nPost-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.\nThe results of drug or biologic development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug or biologic, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the drug or biologic. The FDA reviews each NDA or BLA submitted to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts it for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. \nOnce the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a drug or biologic is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the NDA or BLA should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the drug or biologic is manufactured and tested. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.\nThe FDA may require, as a condition of approval, restricted distribution and use, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, submission of promotional materials, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising or commitments to conduct additional research post-approval. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form. \nExpedited Review and Approval\nThe FDA has developed a number of distinct approaches to make new drugs or biologics available as rapidly as possible in cases where there is no available treatment or there are advantages over existing treatments.\nThe FDA may grant “accelerated approval” to products that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. For accelerated approval, the product must have an effect on a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe the clinical benefit. These studies are known as “confirmatory trials.” Approval of a drug may be withdrawn, or the labeled indication of the drug changed if these trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug or biologic. \nThe FDA may grant “fast track” status to products that treat serious diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product’s development plan and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of an NDA or BLA for FDA review \nbefore the entire submission is completed. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval.\n“Breakthrough Therapy” designation is a process designed to expedite the development and review of drugs or biologics that are intended to treat a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all of the benefits of fast-track designation in addition to robust FDA-sponsor interaction and communication to help to identify the most efficient and expeditious path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens.\n“Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy,” (“RMAT”) designation is a process created by the 21st Century Cures Act in December 2016. A product is eligible for RMAT designation if it is a regenerative medicine therapy that is intended to treat, modify, reverse or cure a serious disease or condition, and if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. The benefits of RMAT designation include the benefits available to breakthrough therapies, including potential eligibility for priority review and accelerated approval based on surrogate or intermediate endpoints. \nThe FDA may grant “priority review” status to a product that, if approved, would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review an NDA or BLA, with the goal to take action on the application within six months from when the application is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review.\nManufacturing Quality Control\nAmong the conditions for NDA or BLA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures continually conform with cGMP. Manufacturers must devote substantial time, money and effort in the areas of production, quality control, and quality assurance to maintain cGMP compliance. Material changes in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, may result in additional regulatory review and approval. The FDA, and other regulatory agencies, conduct periodic visits to inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. If a manufacturing facility is not in substantial compliance with the applicable regulations and requirements imposed when the product was approved, regulatory or judicial enforcement action may be initiated, which may include a warning letter, suspension of manufacturing, product seizure, or an injunction against shipment of products from the facility and/or recall of products previously shipped. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of our products. Future FDA, state, and foreign inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt manufacture or distribution of our products or require substantial resources to correct.\nPost-approval Requirements\nOnce an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, the sponsor of an approved drug in the U.S. may not promote that drug for unapproved, although a physician may prescribe a drug for an unapproved use in accordance with the practice of medicine. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of unapproved uses, as well as false or misleading promotion. Further, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. \nProducts we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:\n•    record-keeping requirements;\n•    reporting of adverse experiences with the product;\n•    providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;\n•    drug sampling and distribution requirements;\n•    notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes;\n•    complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements; and\n•    complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.\nFailure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the drug or biologic development process, approval process or after approval, may subject us or our collaborators to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:\n•    restrictions on marketing or manufacturing of the product; \n•    safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;\n•    refusal to approve or delay in review of pending applications;\n•    withdrawal of an approval or the implementation of limitations on a previously approved indication for use;\n•    imposition of a clinical hold, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) or other safety-related limitations;\n•    warning letters or “untitled letters;”\n•    product seizures, recalls, or detentions, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;\n•    total or partial suspension of production or distribution; \n•    consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or\n•    injunctions, fines, disgorgement, refusals of government contracts, or civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA typically advises that patients treated with gene therapy undergo follow-up observations for potential adverse events for a 15-year period. As part of the FDA approval of CASGEVY for the treatment of SCD and TDT, we are required to conduct two post-marketing requirement (“PMR”) safety studies to assess the long-term risk of hematologic malignancies and off-target genome editing effects by CRISPR/Cas9. Both PMR safety studies are consistent with the FDA’s guidance for industry on Long Term Follow-up After Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products. \nUnited States Patent Term Restoration and Regulatory Exclusivity\nUpon approval, products may be entitled to certain kinds of exclusivity under applicable intellectual property and regulatory regimes. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The length of the patent extension is roughly based on 50 percent of the period of time from the filing of an IND for a compound to the submission of the NDA for such compound, plus 100 percent of the time period from NDA submission to regulatory approval. The extension, however, cannot exceed five years and the patent term remaining after regulatory approval cannot exceed 14 years.\nIf the FDA approves a drug product that contains a new chemical entity not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. \nBiologics are also entitled to exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (the “BPCIA”), which was passed as Title VII to the ACA. The law provides a pathway for approval of products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity, the period of time during which an innovator’s clinical data cannot be used by other companies, from the time of first licensure of the product, and an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product \nwas first licensed. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. Biologics are also eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, as discussed below. The law also includes an extensive process for the innovator biologic and biosimilar manufacturer to litigate patent infringement, validity, and enforceability prior to the approval of the biosimilar. There have been ongoing federal legislative and administrative efforts as well as judicial challenges seeking to repeal, modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. While none of those efforts have focused on changes to the provisions of the ACA related to the biosimilar regulatory framework, if the ACA is repealed, substantially modified, or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impact such action would have on biosimilar regulation.\nIf the NDA or BLA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days each existing exclusivity (patent and regulatory) related to the product.\nOrphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. \nIf a drug or biologic that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug or biologic for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease or condition for seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of our products for seven years if a competitor first obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, for the same disease or condition for which we were seeking approval. KALYDECO, ORKAMBI, SYMDEKO, TRIKAFTA, ALYFTREK and CASGEVY have been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA.\nWe may pursue orphan drug designation for certain of our future product candidates. Even if we obtain orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for the product candidate for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing novel therapies. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent different drugs from being approved for the same condition. Moreover, orphan drug exclusivity may not prevent the approval of another sponsor’s product that is considered to be the same drug for a different disease or condition, even where such product could be prescribed for an unapproved indication that is protected by orphan drug exclusivity. Even after an orphan drug is approved, regulators may subsequently approve the same drug made by another manufacturer for the same condition if the regulator concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug or biologic nor gives the drug or biologic any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nForeign Regulation\nWe conduct clinical trials and market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have clinical trial, product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Thus, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the E.U., before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.\nUnder the E.U. regulatory system, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for orphan medicines, medicines produced by biotechnology, and those medicines intended to treat AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, or diabetes, and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all E.U. member states. In addition to the centralized procedure, the E.U. also has a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to and approval determination by each country; a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision.\nAdditionally, our European headquarters and European research facility are located in the U.K. Despite the U.K. formally withdrawing from the E.U. on January 31, 2020, a number of E.U. regulations were retained in U.K. law. The U.K. government has communicated an intent to remove or replace some of these E.U. provisions, which may increase some regulatory divergence between the U.K. and the E.U. Given the uncertainty as to what changes may be incorporated into U.K. law, it is unclear if any such changes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRegulations Concerning Reimbursement\nSales of our products depend, to a large degree, on the extent to which our products will be reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed health care organizations. Increasingly, these third-party payors are becoming stricter in the ways they evaluate and reimburse medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of health care costs has become a priority of many governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our revenues. Decisions by third-party payors to not cover a product could reduce physician usage of the product.\nIn the U.S., we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, Medicare, and other governmental pricing programs. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low-income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs, which includes select inpatient drugs for which there is “direct reimbursement.” Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicaid and Medicare programs. \nAny company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also must participate in the 340B drug pricing program (the “340B program”), and the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) pricing program. The 340B program, which is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, requires participating companies to agree to charge statutorily defined “covered entities” no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for covered outpatient drugs. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on pricing data calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The FSS pricing program, which is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), also requires participating companies to extend discounted prices to the VA, Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and Public Health Service. Similar to the 340B program, FSS prices are calculated utilizing pricing data reported by us to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis.\nThe Medicare program includes “Part A” that generally covers certain hospital services for eligible beneficiaries. In general, Part A covers inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing, and hospice care. Most individuals are enrolled in Medicare Part A upon reaching age 65 (although other individuals qualify for Part A, including those receiving services for end stage renal disease). Prescription drugs that are used as part of an inpatient hospital stay will be covered by Medicare Part A, and these products typically are paid as part of a bundled or composite rate (e.g., diagnosis related group).\nThe Medicare Part D program provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under “Part D,” Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, which provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs such as our acute pain and CF medicines. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutics committee. U.S. government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. \nPrivate payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. As a result, any reduction in payment that results from Part D reimbursement may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors for our products. Additionally, private payors, including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S., are adopting more aggressive utilization management techniques, and are increasingly applying restrictive plan designs that can impact patients and manufacturers and they continue to push for significant discounts and rebates from manufacturers. As a consequence, these payors may not cover or adequately reimburse for use of our products or may do so at levels that disadvantage them relative to competitive products.\nThe U.S. government has shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs for medicines and has enacted reforms at the state and federal level designed to, among other things, modify prescription drug reimbursement amounts and methodologies, and otherwise control health care costs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) was enacted in March 2010 and was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall health care costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA was designed to expand and increase industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs, impose an annual fee on branded pharmaceutical manufacturers, subject biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. Additionally, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted, establishing a Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, a Medicare inflationary rebate, and a redesign of the Part D benefit structure. Certain drugs, including our CF medicines and CASGEVY, are excluded from the IRA negotiation program. Nevertheless, other elements of the IRA may have a material impact on our business, including the redesign of the Part D benefit and the new Manufacturer Discount Program, which will require manufacturers to take on more of the beneficiary cost previously subsidized by the federal government through the application of increased drug discounts. Under the Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation (“NOPAIN”) Act, CMS reimbursement for novel, oral, non-opioids will include an add-on payment when the drug is used in the hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgery center settings. We expect that JOURNAVX, our recently approved medicine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain, will qualify for inclusion on the list of applicable drugs under the NOPAIN Act. \nWe anticipate that the U.S. government will continue to engage in activities seeking to address drug pricing and reimbursement. Furthermore, certain states have enacted laws establishing Prescription Drug Affordability Boards (“PDABs”). Some state PDABs, including those in Colorado, Maryland, Washington, and Minnesota, either have the authority or have defined a pathway pursuant to which they may be granted the authority to establish upper payment limits for prescription drugs. In certain states, there is pending litigation that would establish a PDAB or expand the authority of an existing PDAB.\nIn Europe and other foreign jurisdictions, the success of our products depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement, because patients are generally unable to access prescription pharmaceutical products that are not reimbursed by their governments. In some countries, such as Germany, commercial sales of a new product may begin while pricing and reimbursement terms are under discussion. In other countries, a company must complete reimbursement negotiations prior to the commencement of commercial supply of the pharmaceutical product. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely country-by-country and region-by-region. For example, the member states of the E.U. can restrict the range of drugs for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and can control the prices of prescription drugs. In addition, many ex-U.S. government payors require companies to provide health economic assessments of products, which are evaluated by government agencies set up for this purpose. A member state may approve a specific price for the drug, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the total amount of money that a company may receive for supply of a drug. Countries also may consider increasing mandatory discounts over time in an attempt to manage increased demands on healthcare budgets. Reimbursement discussions in foreign countries often result in a reimbursement price that is lower than the net price that companies can obtain for the product in the U.S. In addition, reimbursement discussions may take a significant period of time resulting in commercialization delays. In some countries where reimbursement has not yet been obtained, or where there are a limited number of eligible people and our medicines or therapies are unregistered, the governments of such countries may agree to purchase our medicines and therapies on an unlicensed and/or named patient basis. Reimbursement for our products cannot be assured because a country or region may only provide for reimbursement on terms that we do not deem adequate. Further, many ex-U.S. governments have introduced or are in the process of introducing legislation focusing on cost containment measures in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of these laws where finalized, the final form of laws under consideration, and their relevant practical application, are unknown at this time, but may lead to lower prices, paybacks, or other forms of discounts or special taxes.\nOther Regulations\nPharmaceutical companies are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the False Claims Act (“FCA”), and other state and federal laws and regulations. In the U.S., the Anti-Kickback Statute generally makes it illegal to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in return for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal health care program. The FCA prohibits knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary \nitems or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the FCA may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity, manufacturing regulations, or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.\nLaws and regulations also have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers, require manufacturers to adopt certain compliance standards or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include U.S. federal and state “sunshine” provisions. The federal sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians, physicians assistants, advanced practice registered nurses, and teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain requirements that are subject to interpretation. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws.\nWe are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. We are also subject to U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (“the Bribery Act”), which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the U.K. generally will be subject to the Bribery Act.\nOur collection and use of personal data as part of our business activities is subject to various privacy and data security laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies, in the U.S., E.U., U.K., Canada, Australia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and other jurisdictions. Such laws and regulations have the potential to affect our business materially, continue to evolve and increasingly are being enforced.\nOur present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import, export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances are or may be applicable to our activities. In addition, as we expand our pipeline and contemplate different approaches that may incorporate the use of medical devices, such approaches may necessitate compliance with regulatory laws applicable to medical devices, including those governing the testing, manufacture, approval, distribution, and marketing of medical devices. Furthermore, the extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.\nWe have a global corporate compliance program designed to actively identify, prevent, and mitigate healthcare fraud and abuse risk through, among other things, the implementation of compliance policies and systems and through the promotion of a culture of compliance. We will continue to devote substantial resources to enhance and expand our corporate compliance program as necessary to help us manage and mitigate our evolving compliance risk environment as our business grows and expands globally. Even with these measures, however, we cannot guarantee compliance with the various complex laws and regulations to which we are subject now or in the future.\nEMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 6,100 employees. Of these employees, approximately 5,100 were based in the U.S. and approximately 1,000 were based outside the U.S. None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective \nbargaining agreement. A small number of employees outside the U.S. are covered by such agreements due to local law or industry requirements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry and from universities and research institutions. At times, when industry conditions are positive, we may face challenges in recruiting and retaining employees across the biotechnology industry due to industry job market dynamics.\nWe rely on skilled, experienced, and innovative employees to conduct the operations of our company. The biotechnology industry is very competitive, and recruiting and retaining such employees is important to the continued success of our business. We are committed to building an outstanding, committed, and passionate team, and we focus on a culture that values all employees. We focus on recruiting, retaining, and developing qualified and talented employees from a diverse range of backgrounds to conduct our research, development, commercial, and other business activities because we believe that each employee brings unique perspectives and strengths, and by embracing these strengths, we can do our best work for patients. \nWe view diversity through a broad lens that encompasses culture, backgrounds, experiences, and worldview to foster creativity and innovation. Our initiatives include learning, resources, and forums that promote belonging in our workplaces; five global employee resource networks that promote connectivity and collaboration across levels and functions; and investments to support equal opportunity in our surrounding communities. \nTo promote our employees’ continued well-being, we offer comprehensive benefits and resources, including those focused on health and income protection, such as life insurance and retirement savings programs. We continue to promote and enhance wellness tools supporting our employees’ mental, social, physical and financial health. We continually review and augment our programs to include benefits that support the evolving needs of our workforce. \nIn addition, we provide our employees with career development and advancement opportunities, including job rotations, mentoring, and managerial training. We are committed to identifying and developing our next generation of leaders and have developed programs focused on manager excellence, talent and succession for critical roles in our organization. \nOTHER MATTERS\nFinancial Information and Significant Customers\nWe operate in one segment, pharmaceuticals.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk, and you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer, possibly materially. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, discussed in more detail in the following section. These risks include, among others, the following key risks:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n•If we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize additional products, our business could be materially harmed.\n•If we are unable to sustain and grow revenues from sales of our CF medicines, our business would be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would likely decline.\n•If we are unable to successfully develop, obtain approval and commercialize treatments for acute and neuropathic pain, our business could be materially harmed.\n•If we are not successful in commercializing CASGEVY, our revenue growth could be limited and our business could be materially harmed. \n•If our competitors bring products with superior product profiles to market, our products may not be competitive, and our revenues could decline.\n•If we discover safety issues with any of our products or if we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and applicable foreign regulations, commercialization efforts for the product could be negatively affected, the approved product could lose its approval, and our business could be materially harmed.\n•If physicians and patients do not accept our products, or if patients do not remain on treatment or comply with their prescribed dosing regimen, our product revenues would decline in future periods.\n•Cell and genetic therapies face increased scrutiny from the public and medical communities and commercial success will depend, in part, upon the acceptance of those communities.\nRisks Related to Pricing of Our Products\n•Government and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means. If they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed.\n•We may experience pricing pressure on our products, which could reduce our revenues and future profitability.\n•Current health care laws and regulations in the U.S. and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the U.S. health care system may affect our ability to commercialize our marketed products profitably.\n•We have experienced challenges commercializing products outside of the U.S., and our future revenues will be dependent on our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products in ex-U.S. markets.\n•Insurance coverage and reimbursement of our cell or genetic therapies is uncertain.\nRisks Related to Development and Clinical Testing of Our Products and Product Candidates\n•Our product candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval, and our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop additional product candidates for both CF and non-CF indications.\n•If we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining regulatory approval, we may incur additional costs, experience delays, or be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\n•If clinical trials are prolonged or delayed, our development timelines for the affected development program could be extended, our costs to develop the product candidate could increase and the competitive position of the product candidate could be adversely affected.\n•Difficulty in enrolling patients could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates, and ultimately delay or prevent regulatory approval.\n•Enrollment for clinical trials for our cell and gene therapies may face additional and unique challenges and adverse developments associated with these clinical trials could result in action by regulatory bodies, including revised requirements for approval.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\n•If regulatory authorities interpret any of our conduct, including our marketing practices, as being in violation of applicable health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting false and misleading promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties. \n•If we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs in the U.S., we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions, and fines that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\n•If our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings seeking approvals for our product candidates.\n•The regulatory approval process for our cell and genetic therapies involves additional consultations with regulatory agencies, costs, and potentially longer timelines as compared to those for small molecules.\nRisks Related to Supply, Manufacturing and Reliance on Third Parties\n•We may face manufacturing, supply, and distribution difficulties, among other challenges, delays, or interruptions, including at our third-parties.\n•We rely on third parties to conduct pre-clinical work, clinical trials and other activities, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such studies and/or trials or failing to satisfy regulatory requirements.\nRisks Related to Business Development Activities\n•We face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and product candidates.\n•Our ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to engage in transactions and collaborations with other entities that add to our pipeline or provide us with new commercial opportunities. \n•We may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or future acquisitions of businesses or technologies, and the integration following any such acquisition may disrupt our business and management. \nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\n•If our patents do not protect our products and our products infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation which could result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products, substantial damages, or circumvention of our patents by third parties.\n•Uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes that are inherently costly and unpredictable. \n•We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n•If we fail to scale our operations to accommodate growth, our business may suffer.\n•A variety of risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.\n•A breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business. \n•If we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, our business could be materially harmed. \n•Failure to maintain our third-party relationships or challenges at or with these third parties could materially harm our business.\nRisks Related to Financial Results and Holding Our Common Stock\n•Our stock price may fluctuate and our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation.\n•Our effective tax rate fluctuates, and changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties, unfavorable resolution to the tax positions we have taken or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our future taxable income.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and commercialize additional products, our business could be materially harmed. \nWe invest significant resources in the research and development of therapies for serious diseases and conditions, including CF, SCD, TDT, acute and peripheral neuropathic pain, IgAN, AMKD, T1D, DM1, and ADPKD. Product development is highly uncertain and expensive. Product candidates that may appear promising in research and development may fail to reach commercial success for many reasons, including:\n•the failure to establish safety and efficacy through clinical trials;\n•the failure to obtain marketing approval for the product candidate;\n•the inability to manufacture the product candidate on economically feasible terms;\n•the failure to gain and maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients or other members of the medical community; and\n•the failure to obtain market acceptance or adequate reimbursement levels from third-party payors or foreign governments for such product.\nIf we are not able to successfully develop and commercialize additional products our business could be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to sustain and grow revenues from sales of our CF medicines, our business would be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would likely decline. \nSubstantially all of our net product revenues have been derived from the sale of our CF medicines over the last several years. As a result, our business is dependent upon our ability to sustain and increase revenues from sales of our CF medicines. We seek to continue to increase our CF product revenue through serial innovation, including development and commercialization of next-generation CF medicines, extending access of CF medicines to younger children with CF, seeking additional approvals for our CF medicines in ex-U.S. markets and securing and maintaining adequate reimbursements for our CF medicines globally, and by developing a nebulized mRNA therapy for the more than 5,000 people with CF who do not make CFTR protein and cannot benefit from CFTR modulators.\nOur concentrated source of revenues presents a number of risks to our business, including:\n•that one or more competing therapies may be developed successfully by others as a treatment for people with CF;\n•that reimbursement policies of payors and other third parties may make it difficult to obtain reimbursement or may reduce the net price we receive for our products;\n•that we may experience manufacturing or supply disruptions for our CF medicines; and\n•that we may experience adverse developments with respect to development or commercialization of our CF medicines. \nOur ability to increase our CF product revenues is dependent in part on our ability to successfully commercialize ALYFTREK, our recently approved once-daily CF medicine. We expect the commercial opportunity for ALYFTREK to depend on three types of patients: (i) those who are currently on a CFTR modulator who may want to switch to ALYFTREK, (ii) those patients who have not yet been initiated on a CFTR modulator or been eligible for a CFTR modulator, and (iii) those who have discontinued from another CFTR modulator. There can be no assurance that people with CF will be willing to switch from their current CFTR modulator or initiate treatment with ALYFTREK if they are not currently being treated by a CFTR modulator.\nIf any of the above risks were to materialize, if we are otherwise unable to increase revenues from sales of our CF medicines, or if we do not meet the expectations of investors or public equity market analysts, our business would be materially harmed and our ability to fund our operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop, obtain approval and commercialize treatments for acute and neuropathic pain, our business could be materially harmed.\nWe believe that a portion of the value attributed to our company by investors is based on our approved and potential treatments for acute and peripheral neuropathic pain. JOURNAVX, which was approved in January 2025 for moderate-to-severe acute pain in adults, may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients or other members of the medical community. In addition to the risks normally associated with launching a new branded product, JOURNAVX will need to compete, and obtain reimbursement from third-party payors, in an acute pain market that largely consists of low-cost generic drugs, including opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and local anesthetics. Similarly, if we are successful in developing and obtaining approval for suzetrigine in peripheral neuropathic pain, this product will face competition from generic anticonvulsant and antidepressant drugs. If we are not able to successfully develop and commercialize treatments for acute and peripheral neuropathic pain, our future net product revenues and cash flows will be adversely affected and our business could be materially harmed.\nIf we are not successful in commercializing CASGEVY, our revenue growth could be limited and our business could be materially harmed. \nWe have invested significant resources in the development and commercialization of CASGEVY. While we have previously successfully commercialized several small molecule drugs, we have limited experience with the commercialization of cell and genetic therapies. Manufacturing and commercialization of CASGEVY is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as small molecules. In addition:\n•the manufacturing process for CASGEVY is more complex than the manufacturing processes for our small molecule medicines and we may encounter difficulties in the production of CASGEVY and ensuring that the product meets required specifications; \n•there are multiple steps along the CASGEVY patient treatment journey, many of which involve significant clinical complexities performed by third parties, including the collection of blood cells from patients, transfer of those cells to and from a manufacturing facility, and other procedures either before or after delivery of CASGEVY;\n•the commercial success of CASGEVY continues to depend in part on the medical community, patients, governments, and third-party or governmental payors accepting it as a medically useful, cost-effective, ethical, and safe, and providing adequate reimbursement; and\n•global market acceptance continues to be dependent in part on the prevalence and severity of side effects associated with the procedure by which CASGEVY is administered, including the prevalence and severity of any side effects resulting from the myeloablative preconditioning regime.\nIn addition, there is actual and potential future competition for CASGEVY, including bluebird’s SCD gene therapy, LYFGENIA™, and its TDT gene therapy, ZYNTEGLO™, which are both approved in the U.S. If competing therapies are commercialized, or developed and then commercialized, more successfully by other companies as a treatment for people with SCD or TDT, our future net product revenues and cash flows will be adversely affected and our business could be materially harmed\nIf we are not successful in commercializing CASGEVY, our business could be materially harmed.\nIf our competitors bring products with superior product profiles to market, our products may not be competitive, and our revenues could decline.\nA number of companies are seeking to identify and develop product candidates for the treatment of CF, SCD, TDT, pain, and other therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Our success in rapidly developing and commercializing our CF medicines may increase the resources that our competitors allocate to the development of potential competitive treatments. If one or more competing therapies are successfully developed as a treatment for people with CF, SCD, TDT, pain or any of the other disease areas we are currently targeting in our pipeline, our products and our net product revenues could face competitive pressures. If one or more competing therapies prove to be superior to our then-existing products and/or product candidates, our business could be materially adversely affected. \nIn addition, our business faces competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies possessing substantially greater financial resources than we possess, as well as from numerous smaller public and private companies, academic institutions, government agencies, public and private research organizations, and charitable venture philanthropy organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection, and/or establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. \nOur products and any products that we develop in the future may not be able to compete effectively with marketed therapies or new therapies that may be developed by competitors. The risk of competition is particularly important to our company because substantially all of our revenues are related to the treatment of people with CF. There are many other companies developing products for the same patient populations that we are pursuing. To compete successfully in these areas, we must demonstrate improved safety, efficacy and/or tolerability, ease of manufacturing, and gain and maintain market acceptance over competing products. \nIf we discover safety issues with any of our products or if we fail to comply with continuing U.S. and applicable foreign regulations, commercialization efforts for the product could be negatively affected, the approved product could lose its approval, and our business could be materially harmed.\nOur products are subject to continuing regulatory oversight, including the review of additional safety information. Products are more widely used by patients once approval has been obtained and therefore side effects and other problems may be observed after approval that were not seen or anticipated, or were not as prevalent or severe, during pre-approval clinical trials or nonclinical studies. The subsequent discovery or appearance of previously unknown or underestimated problems with a product could negatively affect commercial sales of the product, result in restrictions on the product or lead to the withdrawal of the product from the market. Each of our CF products shares at least one active pharmaceutical ingredient with another of our products. As a result, if any of our CF products were to experience safety issues or labeling modifications, our other CF products may be adversely affected. For example, in December 2024, the FDA modified the labeling of TRIKAFTA by revising information regarding liver injury and liver failure and moving it from the “warnings and precautions” section to a “boxed warning” section, and included similar language in the ALYFTREK label. In SCD and TDT, as part of the FDA approval for CASGEVY, we are required to conduct two post-marketing requirement safety studies to assess the long-term risk of hematologic malignancies and off-target genome editing effects by CRISPR/Cas9. Negative or ambiguous results from these studies could have a significant impact on our ability to commercialize our products. \nThe reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or public speculation about such events could cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility. Our business also may be materially harmed by reduced coverage or reimbursement by payors, impaired sales of our products, denial or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, non-renewal of conditional regulatory approvals, required label changes or additional clinical trials, reputational harm, or government investigations or lawsuits brought against us.\nOur products are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, export, recordkeeping, and submission of safety and other post-market information. We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with cGMP and other applicable regulations governing the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Regulatory authorities periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facilities, and those of our third-party manufacturers, to evaluate compliance with cGMP and other regulatory requirements.\nIf we or our collaborators, or third-parties acting on our behalf, fail to comply with applicable continuing regulatory requirements, we or our collaborators may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals for specific products, product recalls and seizures, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. \nIf physicians and patients do not accept our products, or if patients do not remain on treatment or comply with their prescribed dosing regimen, our product revenues would decline in future periods.\nOur approved products may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients or other members of the medical community. Effectively marketing our products and any of our product candidates or investigational therapies, if approved, requires substantial efforts, both prior to launch and after approval. Physicians may elect not to prescribe or recommend our therapies, and patients may elect not to take them or receive them or they may discontinue use of our products after initiation of treatment, for a variety of reasons including:\n•prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n•lack of reimbursement availability from third-party payors, including governmental entities;\n•lower demonstrated efficacy, safety and/or tolerability compared to alternative treatment methods;\n•lack of cost-effectiveness;\n•a decision to wait for the approval of other therapies in development that have significant perceived advantages over our product;\n•inconvenience of, or burdens associated with, administration or treatment;\n•limitations or warnings contained in the labeling; \n•the timing of market introduction of our product as well as competitive products;\n•other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and\n•inadequate sales, marketing and/or distribution support.\nIf our medicines fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenues in future periods.\nCell and genetic therapies face increased scrutiny from the public and medical communities and commercial success will depend, in part, upon the acceptance of those communities. \nThere is some degree of uncertainty as to whether cell and gene therapy treatments will continue to gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. The commercial success of cell and gene therapy treatments, including CASGEVY, will depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients, and third-party payors of gene therapy products in general, and our product candidates in particular, as medically necessary, cost-effective and safe. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians prescribing our therapies in lieu of existing treatments they are already familiar with and for which greater clinical data may be available. Moreover, physicians and patients may delay acceptance of cell and gene therapies until the therapies have been on the market for a certain amount of time. In addition, medical centers, including authorized treatment centers, that administer procedures accompanying treatment could experience capacity constraints, and these centers are subject to competing priorities that could delay patient access to procedures associated with cell and gene therapy products. Negative public opinion or more restrictive government regulations may delay or impair the successful commercialization of, and demand for, cell and gene therapies.\nRisks Related to Pricing of Our Products\nGovernment and other third-party payors seek to contain costs of health care through legislative and other means. If they fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement rates for our products, our revenues will be harmed.\nSales of our products depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. and the national health care systems in ex-U.S. markets, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The trend in the health care industry is cost containment, and efforts of third-party payors to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to establish or maintain appropriate prices for our products or any drugs that we may develop and commercialize. \nIn the U.S., there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls that are similar to those that currently exist in Europe. For example, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) required manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs to provide discounts on those drugs to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap; increased the rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies to state Medicaid programs on drugs covered by Medicaid; and imposed an annual fee, which increases annually, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Additionally, private payors, including health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S., are adopting more aggressive utilization management techniques and are increasingly applying restrictive plan designs that can impact patients and manufacturers, and they continue to push for significant discounts and rebates from manufacturers. \nOn August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted. Among other things, the IRA establishes a Drug Price Negotiation Program, under which the government may negotiate maximum fair prices for certain drugs covered by Medicare that do not have generic or biosimilar competition. The first set of maximum fair prices will be effective in 2026. Certain products are excluded from the negotiation program including drugs that have a single orphan drug designation and that are not approved for any other orphan or non-orphan diseases or conditions. We cannot predict with certainty whether there will be future legislative changes to the scope of these exclusions or how they will affect future drugs that we may develop and commercialize. The law also requires manufacturers to pay a rebate to Medicare if the price of a Medicare drug (under both Part B and Part D) increases faster than the rate of inflation and redesigns the Part D benefit. Starting in 2025, manufacturers of brand drugs and biologics will be required to provide a 10% discount during the initial phase and a 20% discount during the catastrophic phase of the Part D benefit. The IRA continues a trend in the U.S. toward reducing drug prices and limiting spending by the federal health care programs on drugs. We expect that this law will affect our business once fully implemented, and it is possible that other legislative updates will have an adverse impact on our revenue. The IRA also requires the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”) to issue program guidance on numerous areas associated with implementation of the law’s requirements, including for drug price negotiation and inflation rebates. While CMS has issued guidance covering the first two years of the program (2026 and 2027), we do not know with certainty what guidance will apply in future years or how such guidance will affect our business. \nIt is possible the U.S. Congress or administration may take further actions to address health care costs and access to medicine, and specifically address coverage and reimbursement of cell and gene therapies. For example, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (“CMMI”) was directed to consider new healthcare payment and delivery models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative drug therapies for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. In February 2023, the U.S. Administration addressed access for cell and gene therapies in diseases such as SCD through the CMS program known as The Cell and Gene Therapy Access Model (“CGT Access Model”). The CGT Access Model was designed to provide an opportunity to accelerate and enhance broad Medicaid access for eligible patients across all 50 U.S. states by allowing state Medicaid agencies to delegate authority to CMS to coordinate and facilitate outcomes-based payment arrangements (“OBAs”) with cell and gene therapy manufacturers, such as ours. In 2024, we reached an agreement with CMS to expand access by participating in the CGT Access Model for SCD to benefit Medicaid beneficiaries. States may begin participating in the Cell & Gene Therapy Access Model on a rolling-basis, between January 2025 and January 2026. In January 2025, President Trump repealed Executive Order 14087, which had directed CMS to consider innovative pricing models, ultimately leading to the CGT Access Model. The rescission currently does not appear to impact our agreement with CMS or CMS’ authority to proceed with the CGT Access Model; however, any discontinuation of the CGT Access Model, or CMS’ termination of our agreement to participate in the model in the future, could impact access to CASGEVY.\nThird-party payors throughout the world also have been attempting to control drug spending in light of global economic pressures. In reimbursement negotiations, many payors are requesting price discounts and caps on total expenditures and limiting both the types and variety of drugs that they will cover if they are not able to secure them. Some payors restrict reimbursement of drugs through implementing utilization management controls. As part of these negotiations, many ex-U.S. government payors also are requiring companies to establish product cost-effectiveness as a condition of reimbursement. These cost-effectiveness reviews may overlook many of the benefits provided by innovative medicines, and for the most part, have not taken into account the specific circumstances of products that treat rare diseases. This has led to conclusions that certain medicines, including our products in certain jurisdictions, are not cost-effective. As a result, certain countries have declined to reimburse, or delayed their reimbursement of, some of our products. Although not mandated in the U.S., various organizations have started advocating for cost-effectiveness analyses in the U.S. as well as value-based contracting in which the amount of reimbursement for a product is based on patient outcomes and other clinical or economic metrics related to the performance of such product. If U.S. payors were to adopt such assessments and make negative coverage determinations or utilize value-based contracts that result in penalties to, or lower rates of, reimbursement, it could adversely affect our product \nrevenues. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we are not able to obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement of our products from third-party payors on a broad, timely, or satisfactory basis, or if such coverage is subject to overly broad or restrictive utilization management controls.\nThe increasing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceuticals for rare or other diseases or conditions, combined with their higher cost as compared to other types of pharmaceutical products, is generating significant third-party payor interest in developing cost-containment strategies targeted to this sector. Government regulations in both U.S. and ex-U.S. markets could further limit the prices that can be charged for our products, including for those with broader patient populations, and may limit our commercial opportunity. The increasing use of cost-effectiveness assessments in markets around the world and the financial challenges faced by many governments may lead to significant adverse effects on our business. \nWe may experience pricing pressure on our products, which could reduce our revenues and future profitability.\nThere also has been an increase in state legislation and regulations related to drug pricing and drug pricing transparency. In the U.S., various states, including Nevada, Maryland, Louisiana, New York, California, Washington, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Utah, Minnesota, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Virginia, Maine, Texas, North Dakota, West Virginia, Florida, and New Jersey have passed legislation requiring companies to disclose extensive information relating to drug prices, drug price increases, and spending on research, development, and marketing, among other things. Although it is not always clear what states will do with the collected information, some laws were designed to obtain additional product discounts. Additionally, certain states have enacted laws establishing Prescription Drug Affordability Boards (“PDABs”). Some state PDABs either have the authority or have defined a pathway where they may be granted the authority to establish upper payment limits for prescription drugs, including Colorado, Maryland, Washington, and Minnesota. Under the Washington law, the PDAB cannot select for an affordability review drugs that are solely for the treatment of an orphan-designated disease or condition. In August 2023, the Colorado PDAB selected five drugs for an affordability review, including TRIKAFTA; later that year, it found TRIKAFTA to be not unaffordable, and thus not eligible for an upper payment limit. We cannot, however, predict whether future reviews by the Colorado PDAB, or any other PDAB, will come to the same conclusion about TRIKAFTA or any of our other therapies, or the amount of any potential upper payment limit. We may continue to see more state action requiring additional disclosures or other actions. In addition, we could see increased federal activity related to drug pricing and transparency requiring disclosures or other actions instead of, or in addition to, state requirements. Similar initiatives also are occurring in, or being considered by, some of our ex-U.S. markets, including Italy and Brazil.\nAdditional state actions, including the importation of drugs from other countries, also may affect the availability and accessibility of our medicines. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA authorized Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration’s drug importation program under section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which eventually would allow Florida to import certain prescription drugs from Canada. The importation of drugs from Canada or other countries that potentially could compete with our medicines could create increased pressure on our revenue and profitability. \nComplying with these laws can be expensive and requires significant personnel and operational resources. Furthermore, any additional required discounts would adversely affect the pricing of, and revenues from, our products. Finally, while we seek to comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements, we face increased enforcement activity by the U.S. federal government, state governments, and private payors against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for pricing and reimbursement-related issues as well as inquiries from the U.S. Congress.\nOther federal activities seeking to specifically address drug pricing and reimbursement include: \n•rulemaking related to importation of prescription drugs from Canada, as well as guidance related to importation of prescription drugs from other foreign countries; \n•attempts to establish reference pricing for certain physician-administered drugs; \n•executive orders relating to drug pricing that are intended to broadly impact the pharmaceutical industry; \n•changes to the federal anti-kickback statute safe harbors that eliminate anti-kickback statute discount safe harbor protection for certain manufacturer rebate arrangements; and\n•legislation relating to drug pricing, including enhanced transparency measures into drug pricing. \nWe expect government scrutiny over drug pricing, reimbursement, and distribution to continue. Potential future government regulation of drug prices or reimbursement creates uncertainties about our portfolio and could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Moreover, antitrust and/or competition laws are increasingly being used to scrutinize pricing on high-value medicines and entities involved in drug distribution or reimbursement, including some with whom we do business. Defending against an antitrust or competition claim can be expensive and requires significant personnel and operational resources, may ultimately lead to a reduction in the prices of our products, and can ultimately result a material adverse effect on profitability and our business overall. Additionally, governmental efforts to pursue compulsory licensing, including the pursuit of so-called “march in” rights, could affect our pricing strategy and result in an adverse impact on our revenue.\nCurrent health care laws and regulations in the U.S. and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the U.S. health care system may affect our ability to commercialize our marketed products profitably.\nThe U.S. government, individual states and some foreign jurisdictions also have been aggressively pursuing legislative and regulatory reforms that could affect our ability to sell products. For example, in the U.S., there have been federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify, or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA, which could affect coverage and payment for medicines. The federal government additionally has proposed and enacted legislation leading to aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which ultimately could affect utilization of medicines. \nOther reforms include the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which contained various provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drugs, including an increase in the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap from 50% to 70%. Under the IRA, the coverage gap phase and the associated coverage gap discount program will be eliminated after the 2024 plan year. Starting in 2025, there will be a new Part D manufacturer discount program, which requires a 10% discount in the initial phase and a 20% discount in the catastrophic phase of the benefit. The IRA also authorizes the government to negotiate maximum fair prices for certain Medicare drugs. It also establishes mandatory rebates for Part B and Part D drugs with prices that increase faster than inflation. These new laws or any other similar laws introduced in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could negatively affect our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in health care legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models.\nAdoption of new health care reform legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot, however, predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any health care reform legislation or action, or its impact on us, including increased compliance requirements and costs, all of which may adversely affect our future business, operations, and financial results.\nWe have experienced challenges commercializing products outside of the U.S., and our future revenues will be dependent on our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products in ex-U.S. markets.\nIn most ex-U.S. markets, the pricing and reimbursement of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control and government authorities are making greater efforts to limit or regulate the price of drug products. The reimbursement process in ex-U.S. markets can take a significant time to conclude and reimbursement decisions are made on a country by country or region by region basis. Further, many ex-U.S. governments are introducing new legislation focusing on cost containment measures in the pharmaceutical industry. The final form of these laws and the relevant practical application is unknown at this time, but may lead to lower prices, paybacks or other forms of discounts or special taxes.\nOur CF medicines and CASGEVY treat life-threatening conditions and address relatively small patient populations, and our research and development programs are primarily focused on developing medicines to treat similar diseases. Both government and private payors are targeting these types of therapies, in some cases refusing to pay for them. We have experienced challenges in obtaining timely reimbursement for our products in various countries outside the U.S. Our future product revenues, including from TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, ALYFTREK, and CASGEVY, depend on, among other things, our ability to maintain reimbursement in ex-U.S. markets for our products. There is no assurance that coverage and reimbursement will be available outside of the U.S. for our approved or future therapies and, even if it is available, whether \nthe timing or the level of reimbursement will be sufficient to allow us to market them. Adverse pricing limitations or a delay in obtaining coverage and reimbursement would decrease our future net product revenues and harm our business. \nInsurance coverage and reimbursement of cell and genetic therapies is uncertain. \nThere is uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of cell or genetic therapies, including those gene therapies that are potential one-time treatments. While coverage has not been a significant obstacle in the launch of CASGEVY, it is difficult to predict what third party payors, including U.S. or ex-U.S. governments or private insurance companies, will decide with respect to reimbursement for the other novel cell and genetic therapies in our pipeline. Additionally, reimbursement rates for cell and genetic therapies approved before ours could create an adverse environment for reimbursement of any therapies we ultimately commercialize. The administration of our products may require procedures for the collection of cells from patients, followed by other procedures either before or after delivery of the cell or genetic therapy. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for these services also is important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may discourage physicians and hospitals from recommending our cell and genetic therapies and impair our ability to market or sell such therapies. Moreover, the treatment center network for our products and growth of such network could also impact uptake and necessitate out-of-state access for some beneficiaries if an authorized treatment center is not available within their home state, which could result in further underpayment from out-of-state Medicaid programs.\nRisks Related to Development and Clinical Testing of Our Products and Product Candidates\nOur product candidates remain subject to clinical testing and regulatory approval, and our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully develop additional product candidates for both CF and non-CF indications.\nOur business depends upon the successful development and commercialization of product candidates. These product candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. To satisfy these standards, we must allocate resources among our various development programs and must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our product candidates. Discovery and development efforts for new pharmaceutical and biological products, including new combination therapies, are resource-intensive and may take 10 to 15 years or longer for each product candidate. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective and safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Despite our efforts, our product candidates may not:\n•offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive therapies;\n•show the level of safety and efficacy, including the level of statistical significance, required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug or biologic;\n•meet applicable regulatory standards;\n•be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs; or\n•if approved for commercial sale, be successfully marketed as pharmaceutical or biological products.\nWe have recently completed and/or have ongoing or planned clinical trials for several of our product candidates. The strength of our product portfolio and pipeline will depend in large part upon the outcomes of these clinical trials, including those evaluating TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO and ALYFTREK in younger children with CF, VX-522 in CF, suzetrigine in peripheral neuropathic pain, VX-993 in acute and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and zimislecel and VX-264 in T1D. Failure to advance product candidates through clinical development could impair our ability to ultimately commercialize products, which could materially harm our business and long-term prospects. \nResults of our clinical trials and findings from our nonclinical studies, including toxicology findings in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials, could lead to abrupt changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a particular product candidate or program. \n Moreover, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidate. Furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or otherwise \nprovide the level of evidence or safety and efficacy required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for approval of a product candidate. Finally, clinical trials are expensive and require significant operational resources to implement and maintain.\nMany companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including our company, have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage clinical trials. For example, the results from completed preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later-stage clinical trials or of the likelihood of approval of a product candidate for commercial sale. \nIn addition, from time to time, we report interim, topline, and preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change. Interim or preliminary data from a clinical trial may not be predictive of final results from the clinical trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment and treatment continues and more patient data become available or as patients from our clinical trials continue other treatments for their disease. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. If the interim, topline, or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nThe ability of third parties to review and/or analyze data from our clinical trials, including as a result of government disclosure, also may increase the risk of commercial confidentiality breaches and result in enhanced scrutiny of our clinical trial results. For example, Clinical Trial Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014, and the EMA policy on publication of clinical data for medicinal products for human use, both permit the EMA to publish clinical information submitted in marketing authorization applications. Third party review and scrutiny could result in public misconceptions regarding our drugs and product candidates. These publications could also result in the disclosure of information to our competitors that we might otherwise deem confidential, which could harm our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining regulatory approval, we may incur additional costs, experience delays, or be unable to commercialize our product candidates.\nThe time required to complete clinical trials and to satisfy the FDA and other countries’ regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years. Our analysis of data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in governmental policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and governmental regulatory review. We also may be unable to obtain or be delayed in obtaining regulatory approval due to competition developments that impact our regulatory pathways. \nWe may seek a Fast Track, Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy, and/or RMAT designation for some of our product candidates. Product candidates that receive one or more of these designations may be eligible for, among other things, a priority regulatory review. Each of these designations is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for Fast Track, Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy and/or RMAT designation, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. The receipt of one or more of these designations for a product candidate does not guarantee a faster development process, review or approval compared to products developed or considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our products or product candidates qualifies for Fast Track, Priority Review, Breakthrough Therapy and/or RMAT designation, the FDA may later decide to withdraw such designation if it determines that the product or product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification. \nAny failure to obtain regulatory approvals for a product candidate would prevent us from commercializing that product candidate. Any delay in obtaining required regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize a product candidate. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations that we do not expect including with respect to the indicated uses for which we may market the product or required conditions of use. Any such limitations could reduce the size or demand of the market for the drug.\nWe also are subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. Non-U.S. jurisdictions have different approval procedures than those required by the FDA, and these jurisdictions may impose additional testing requirements for our product candidates. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process described above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the U.S. and approval by a foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by the FDA. In addition, although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S., acceptance of this data is subject to conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The trial population also must adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial that we conduct outside the U.S., it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt our development of the applicable product candidate.\nIf clinical trials are prolonged or delayed, our development timelines for the affected development program could be extended, our costs to develop the product candidate could increase and the competitive position of the product candidate could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict whether or not we will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from our completed or ongoing clinical trials. Among the factors that could delay our development programs are:\n•ongoing discussions with the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials and the number of clinical trials we must conduct;\n•failure or delay in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (“CROs”) and clinical trial sites;\n•failure to add or delay in adding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and obtaining institutional review board or independent ethics committee approval at each clinical trial site;\n•suspension or termination of clinical trials of product candidates for various reasons, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements;\n•clinical trial sites deviating from clinical trial protocol or dropping out of a clinical trial;\n•delays in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials, including as a result of low numbers of patients that meet the eligibility criteria for the trial;\n•a lower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers or patients in clinical trials;\n•the need to repeat clinical trials as a result of unfavorable or inconclusive results, unforeseen complications in testing or clinical investigator error;\n•inadequate supply or deficient quality of product candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;\n•unfavorable FDA or foreign regulatory authority inspection and review of a manufacturing facility that supplied clinical trial materials or its relevant manufacturing records or a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;\n•unfavorable or inconclusive scientific results from clinical trials;\n•serious and unexpected treatment-related side-effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by participants in clinical trials being conducted by our competitors to evaluate product candidates with similar mechanisms of action or structures to therapies that we are developing;\n•favorable results in testing of our competitors’ product candidates, or FDA or foreign regulatory authority approval of our competitors’ product candidates; or\n•action by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority to place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on a trial or compound or deeming the clinical trial conduct as problematic. \nFor planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in many cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our estimates may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nDifficulty in enrolling patients could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates, and ultimately delay or prevent regulatory approval.\nOur ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis is subject to a number of factors. Clinical trials are expensive and require significant operational resources. Delays in patient enrollment or unforeseen drop-out rates may result in increased costs and longer development times. The enrollment of patients further depends on many factors, including:\n•the proximity of patients to clinical trial sites;\n•the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, and the design of the clinical trial;\n•our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n•the number of other clinical trials ongoing and competing for patients in the same indication;\n•our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n•reporting of the preliminary results of any of our clinical trials;\n•the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease and eligibility criteria for the clinical trial;\n•the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the clinical trials before clinical trial completion; and\n•factors we may not be able to control, such as pandemics that may limit patients, principal investigators or staff or clinical site availability.\nWe, our collaborators, the FDA, or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time if we or they believe the healthy volunteers or patients participating in such clinical trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons. Any such suspension could materially adversely affect the development of a particular product candidate and our business.\nEnrollment for clinical trials for our cell and gene therapies may face additional and unique challenges and adverse developments associated with these clinical trials could result in action by regulatory bodies, including revised requirements for approval.\nFor cell and genetic therapy programs addressing rare genetic diseases with small patient populations, we may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics, to complete our clinical studies in an adequate and timely manner. Additionally, patients may be unwilling to participate in our clinical trials because of concerns that cell and genetic therapies are unsafe or unethical, negative publicity from adverse safety events in the biotechnology or gene therapy industries, or for other reasons, including competitive clinical studies for similar patient populations. Moreover, adverse developments in clinical trials conducted by others of cell and genetic therapy products or products created using similar technology, or adverse public perception of the field of cell and genetic therapies, may cause the FDA and other regulatory bodies to revise the requirements for approval of any cell or genetic therapy product \ncandidates we may develop or limit the use of products utilizing technologies such as ours, either of which could materially harm our business. \nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nIf regulatory authorities interpret any of our conduct, including our marketing practices, as being in violation of applicable health care laws, including fraud and abuse laws, laws prohibiting false and misleading promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties. \nWe are subject to health care fraud and abuse laws, such as the FCA and the AKS, and other similar laws and regulations both in the U.S. and in non-U.S. markets.\nIn the U.S., the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the ordering, furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Because of the broad scope of the prohibition, most financial interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers, third party payors and patients would be subject to the statute. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, financial interactions must be structured carefully to qualify for protection or otherwise withstand scrutiny. \nFederal false claims laws, including the FCA, prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in promotion for uses that the FDA has not approved, that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for those unapproved uses; submitting inflated “best price” information to the Medicaid Rebate Program; and certain manufacturing-related violations. The scope of this and other laws may expand in ways that make compliance more difficult and expensive. \nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance or consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling. Although physicians are generally permitted, based on their medical judgment, to prescribe products for indications other than those approved by the applicable regulatory agency, manufacturers are prohibited from promoting such unapproved uses. We market our products to eligible people with CF, SCD, TDT, and acute pain for whom the applicable product has been approved and provide promotional materials and informational programs to physicians regarding the use of each product in these patient populations. These eligible people do not represent all people with CF, SCD, TDT, and acute pain. If a regulatory agency determines that our promotional materials, or other activities constitute promotion of unapproved uses or otherwise false and misleading promotion, it could request that we modify our promotional materials or other activities, conduct corrective advertising, or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, such as the issuance of a warning or untitled letter, injunction, seizure, civil fines and criminal penalties. It also is possible that other federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they believe that the alleged improper promotion led to the submission and payment of claims for an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Even if it is later determined we were not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our actions, and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.\nIn the U.S., federal and state laws regulate financial interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers, require disclosure to government authorities and the public of such interactions, and mandate the adoption of compliance standards or programs. For example, the so-called federal “sunshine law” requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to CMS payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians, physicians assistants, advanced practice registered nurses, and teaching hospitals. We also have similar reporting obligations with respect to financial interactions throughout the E.U. We expended significant efforts to establish, and are continuing to devote significant resources to maintain and enhance, systems and processes to comply with these regulations. Requirements to track and disclose financial interactions with health care providers and organizations increase government and public scrutiny of these financial interactions. As we commercialize products in areas with broader patient populations, we will have more \ninteractions with a broader set of healthcare practitioners. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements could result in significant civil monetary penalties. \nThe sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from government authorities in the U.S. and other countries in which we market our products, and we believe that this trend will continue. Many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by the government authorities or the courts, and their provisions are subject to a variety of interpretations. While we have a corporate compliance program which, together with our policies and procedures, is designed to actively identify, prevent and mitigate risk through the implementation of compliance policies and systems and the promotion of a culture of compliance, if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws and regulations, our business could be materially harmed. We may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Even if we successfully defend against government challenge, responding to the challenge may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or other governmental pricing programs in the U.S., we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions, and fines that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the 340B program, and a number of other federal and state government pricing programs in the U.S. to obtain coverage for our products by certain government health care programs. These programs require us to pay rebates or provide discounts to certain government payors or private purchasers in connection with our products when dispensed to beneficiaries of these programs. In some cases, such as with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the rebates are based on pricing and rebate calculations that we report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the government agencies that administer the programs. The terms, scope and complexity of these government pricing programs may change. For example, regulations finalized in December 2020 created an alternative Medicaid rebate formula for “line extensions” of oral solid dosage forms. Moreover, in December 2020, CMS finalized changes to Medicaid Drug Rebate Program pricing calculations regarding the provision of co-payment assistance to patients that may be impacted by so-called accumulator programs operated by private insurers or pharmacy benefit managers. The portion of this rule dealing with manufacturer co-payment assistance was struck down by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2022 (and the deadline for an appeal has lapsed). In September 2024, CMS issued a final rule withdrawing the challenged accumulator adjustment regulations. The rule made significant changes to, among other things, penalties for misclassification and the definitions of a covered outpatient drug, internal investigation and market date, which may have an impact on our Medicaid rebate liability. \nAdditionally, the expansion of the 340B Drug Discount Program through the ACA has increased the number of purchasers, known as covered entities, who are eligible for significant discounts on branded drugs. In general, covered entities distribute 340B drugs through their own in-house pharmacies. A growing number of covered entities have been contracting with retail and/or specialty pharmacies, known as contract pharmacies, to distribute 340B drugs. Manufacturers have begun to implement restrictions on covered entities that use contract pharmacies. Similarly, we limit hospital covered entities to contract with one contract pharmacy if the covered entity does not have an in-house outpatient pharmacy. Otherwise, hospital covered entities that have an in-house outpatient pharmacy are not permitted to use contract pharmacies. Our policy applies to our CF and pain products, and it does not apply to Federal grantees and hospitals and any covered entities in states that prohibit manufacturers from restricting covered entities from accessing 340B drugs through contract pharmacies. Certain states, including Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, and West Virginia, have passed laws to regulate the relationship between manufacturers and contract pharmacies. A number of manufacturers have filed lawsuits against these states. These and future changes to government pricing programs, laws, and regulations may have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operations. \nWe also may have reimbursement obligations or be subject to penalties if we fail to provide timely and accurate information to the government, pay the correct rebates, or offer the correct discounted pricing. Changes to the price reporting or rebate requirements of these programs would affect our obligations to pay rebates or offer discounts. For example, the removal of the current statutory 100% of Average Manufacturer Price per-unit cap on Medicaid rebate liability for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, effective as of January 1, 2024, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, may affect the prices that are required to be charged to covered entities under the 340B Drug Discount Program. Additionally, the IRA requires manufacturers to pay rebates for Medicare Part B and Part D drugs with prices that increase \nfaster than the rate of inflation. Responding to current and future changes to these and other Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requirements may reduce our net revenues and the complexity of compliance, will be time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf our processes and systems are not compliant with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to restrictions on marketing our products or could be delayed in submitting regulatory filings seeking approvals for our product candidates.\nWe have a number of regulated processes and systems that are required both prior to and following approval of our drugs and product candidates. These processes and systems are subject to continual review and periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. In addition, the clinical research organizations and other third parties that we work with in our non-clinical studies and clinical trials and our oversight of such parties are subject to similar reviews and periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. If compliance issues are identified at any point in the development and approval process, we may experience delays in filing for regulatory approval for our product candidates, or delays in obtaining regulatory approval after filing, if at all. Any later discovery of previously unknown problems or safety issues with approved products or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of products from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or a refusal by the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we are party to agreements that transfer responsibility for complying with specified regulatory requirements, such as filing and maintenance of marketing authorizations and safety reporting or compliance with manufacturing requirements, to our collaborators and third-party manufacturers. If our collaborators or third-party manufacturers do not fulfill these regulatory obligations, any products for which we or they obtain approval may be subject to later restrictions on manufacturing or sale, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nThe regulatory approval process for our cell or genetic therapies involves additional consultations with regulatory agencies, costs, and potentially longer timelines as compared to those for small molecules. \nAs we advance our cell and genetic therapy product candidates, we will be required to consult with various regulatory authorities, and we must comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, which may change from time to time, including during the course of development of our cell and genetic therapy product candidates. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue the clinical development of certain of our cell and genetic therapy product candidates. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected. Even if we comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and even if we maintain close coordination with the applicable regulatory authorities with oversight over our cell and genetic therapy product candidates, our development programs may experience delays or fail to succeed. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential cell or genetic therapy product to market would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe regulatory approval process and clinical trial requirements for cell and genetic therapies can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied product candidates, and regulatory requirements governing cell and genetic therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. For example, the FDA established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) to consolidate the review of cell therapies and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. These and other regulatory review agencies, committees and advisory groups, and the requirements and guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. \nWe are subject to various and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal data, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business, result in fines and/or criminal penalties, and damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that apply to the collection, storage, use, sharing, and security of personal data, including health information, and impose significant compliance obligations. In addition, numerous other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and security \nof personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. As we enter into new disease areas and jurisdictions both commercially and for clinical trials, we must continue to evaluate new and evolving privacy laws. \nFor example, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect in 2018 and has imposed new obligations on us with respect to our processing of personal data and the cross-border transfer of such data, including higher standards of obtaining consent, more robust transparency requirements, data breach notification requirements, requirements for contractual language with our data processors, and stronger individual data rights. Different E.U. member states have interpreted the GDPR differently and many have imposed additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in the E.U. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the E.U., including the U.S. and the U.K., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR. Similarly, other jurisdictions have either introduced or enacted legislation or executive orders restricting cross-border data transfers. These regulations restrict the transfer of certain types of data (e.g., sensitive personal data) or restrict the transfer of data to certain jurisdictions. The rules related to cross border data transfers continue to evolve based on court decisions and regulator guidance, which presents certain practical challenges to compliance. Regulators also continue to focus enforcement efforts on behavioral advertising and other online tracking technologies commonly used by companies. Compliance with these evolving rules is challenging, as country specific guidance and rules are continually changing and limited alternatives currently exist in the market. Compliance with the these laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation, and reputational harm in connection with any activities falling within the scope of the GDPR or other privacy laws or regulations.\nIn the U.S., numerous states have introduced or enacted comprehensive privacy legislation. Similar to the California Consumer Rights Act, which came into effect in January 2023), these comprehensive privacy laws place numerous obligations on businesses with respect to the collection and processing of personal data. Some states have passed privacy legislation focusing specifically on the collection and processing of consumer health data. Enforcement at the federal level in the U.S. from the FTC has been focused on the use of health information for targeted advertising. While we continue to address the implications of the new data privacy regulations, data privacy remains an evolving landscape at both the domestic and international level, with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal challenges. Each law is also subject to various interpretations by courts and regulatory agencies, creating even more uncertainty. While we have a global privacy program that addresses such laws and regulations, our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful.\nWe must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with the changing landscape in this area. Failure to comply with data protection laws may expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities, private rights of action in some jurisdictions, and potential significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant. Failure to comply with the GDPR and applicable national data protection laws of European Economic Area member states could lead to fines of up to €20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual revenue of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Some of these laws and regulations also carry the possibility of criminal sanctions. For example, while we are not directly subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”), we could be subject to penalties, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered health care provider or research institution that has not complied with HIPAA’s requirements for disclosing such information. In addition, the commercialization of cell and gene therapies requires the collection and processing of a greater amount of personal data than traditional therapies, potentially increasing risk. Furthermore, the number of government investigations and enforcement actions related to data security incidents and privacy violations, with a specific focus on online data sharing, continue to increase and government investigations typically require significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business and our reputation.\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research and development efforts involve the regulated use of hazardous materials, chemicals, and various controlled and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by state, federal and foreign regulations, the risk of loss of, or accidental contamination \nor injury from, these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We also are subject to numerous environmental, health, and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, and the handling of biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential liabilities. We maintain insurance to cover pollution conditions or other extraordinary or unanticipated events relating to our use and disposal of hazardous materials that we believe is appropriate based on the small amount of hazardous materials we generate. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\nRisks Related to Supply, Manufacturing and Reliance on Third Parties \nWe may face manufacturing, supply, and distribution difficulties, among other challenges, delays, or interruptions, including at our third-party providers. \nWe rely on a worldwide network of third-party manufacturers and our internal capabilities, including our own manufacturing facilities in Boston, to manufacture product candidates for clinical trials as well as our medicines for commercial use. We also depend on third-party logistics providers to manage our shipments globally, and on approved distributors for supply, sales and marketing in certain markets. While we have developed internal capabilities to supply product candidates for use in our clinical trials as well as some of our products for commercial sale, a majority of the manufacturing steps needed to produce our medicines, therapies, product candidates, and drug products are performed through a third-party manufacturing network. The manufacture of our products and product candidates can be complex, which may require lengthy technology transfers between us and the third parties on which we rely. We expect that we will continue to rely on third parties to meet our commercial supply needs and a significant portion of our clinical supply needs for the foreseeable future.\nWe could be subject to significant supply interruptions as a result of disruptions to third party or our internal manufacturing capabilities. Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and manufacturing drug product ready for distribution, including obtaining necessary supplies, is a multi-step international endeavor. Third-party contract manufacturers, including some in China, perform different parts of our manufacturing process. Contract manufacturers may supply us with raw materials, convert these raw materials into drug substance and/or convert the drug substance into final dosage form. We also use third parties are used for packaging, warehousing, and distribution of products. We maintain property insurance to cover potential losses that may result from supply interruptions or destruction at these third parties, however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses that may result. \nThe manufacturing and logistics for cell and genetic therapies are highly complex, often short lead time operations that require partnership with an extensive network of third parties to deliver product. These manufacturing and logistics operations require significant investment by us to secure capacity at third parties with expertise to meet our requirements. Even with the relevant experience and expertise, manufacturers of cell and genetic therapy products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, and compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations. There are many risks that could result in delays and additional costs, including the need to hire and train qualified employees and obtain access to necessary equipment and third-party technology. This capacity may be limited by the number of other clinical trials and commercial manufacturing ongoing for other companies seeking similar support. \nIf third parties are unwilling or unable to meet our requirements, we could experience supply disruptions outside of our control. Additionally, manufacturing facilities, both foreign and domestic, are subject to inspections by the FDA and other U.S. and foreign government authorities. Although we actively engage with regulatory authorities, the timing of regulatory approvals for each of these facilities may be delayed for a variety of reasons. We may experience supply disruptions if regulatory agencies are unable to inspect the manufacturing facilities on which we rely. In addition, we and the third parties with whom we engage are required to maintain compliance with quality regulations globally. An inability to maintain compliance with such regulations, including cGMP requirements, could cause significant disruptions to our business and operations.\nAdditionally, establishing, managing and expanding our global manufacturing and supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of our numerous third-party contractual relationships. We may not \nbe able to agree on contractual terms with third parties as needed for manufacturing of our products. Although we attempt to manage the business relationships with our partners, we could be subject to supply disruptions outside of our control.\nSupply disruptions may result from a number of factors, including shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays, general global supply chain disruptions, events beyond our control, or any other performance failure by us or any third-party manufacturer on which we rely. Additionally, unfavorable geopolitical events or situations could affect our ability to interact with or conduct business with specific vendors within our global supply network, or could prevent or delay the transportation of supplies or products to their planned destination. Any such disruptions could disrupt sales of our products and/or the timing or advancement of our clinical trials.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturers become unable (including potentially through governmental actions or legislation targeted toward them) or unwilling to continue manufacturing product and we are not able to promptly identify another manufacturer, we could experience a disruption in the commercial supply of our then-marketed medicines, which would have a significant effect on patients, our business, and our product revenues. Similarly, a disruption in the clinical supply of product candidates could delay the completion of clinical trials and affect timelines for regulatory filings. We have a limited number of critical steps and key materials for our manufacturing process that are single sourced, including for commercialized products. To ensure the stability of our supply chains, we continue to develop alternative suppliers for our manufacturing processes and key materials. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain additional manufacturers or capacity for all of our product candidates and products on a timely basis or at all.\nIn the course of providing its services, a contract manufacturer may develop process technology related to the manufacture of our products or product candidates that the manufacturer owns, either independently or jointly with us. This would increase our reliance on that manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from that manufacturer to have our products or product candidates manufactured by other suppliers utilizing the same process.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct pre-clinical work, clinical trials and other activities, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet established deadlines for the completion of such studies and/or trials or failing to satisfy regulatory requirements.\nWe rely on third parties such as CROs to help manage certain pre-clinical work and our clinical trials and on medical institutions, clinical investigators, and clinical research organizations such as the Therapeutic Development Network, which is primarily funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, to assist in the design and review of, and to conduct our clinical trials, including enrolling qualified patients. In addition, we engage third party contractors to support numerous other research, commercial and administrative activities. Our reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the clinical trial. Moreover, the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities around the world require us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as good laboratory practices and good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Such standards, particularly with respect to newer cell and genetic therapies, will continue to evolve and subject us and third parties to new or changing requirements. \nIf these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be required to replace them. Although we believe that there are a number of other third-party contractors we could engage to continue the activities, it may result in a delay of the affected clinical trial, product development program or applicable activity. If clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulatory authorities might significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of these clinical trials or in specific circumstances might result in a requirement that a clinical trial be redone. Accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our product candidates could be delayed. In addition, failure of any third-party contractor to conduct activities in accordance with our expectations, could adversely affect the relevant research, development, commercial or administrative activity. \nRisks Related to Business Development Activities\nWe face risks in connection with existing and future collaborations with respect to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and product candidates. \nThe risks that we face in connection with our current collaborations, including with CRISPR, Moderna, Entrada, and Zai, and any future collaborations, include the following:\n•Collaborators may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, drugs or therapies that are similar to or competitive with the products or product candidates that are the subject of their collaborations with us.\n•Disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities or costs for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration. Any such disagreements would divert management attention and resources and would be time-consuming and expensive.\n•Collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation.\n•Collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability.\n•Investigations and/or compliance or enforcement actions against a collaborator, which may expose us to indirect liability as a result of our partnership with such collaborator.\nIf a collaborator were to be involved in a business combination with a third party, it might de-emphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us. If one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be harmed.\nMoreover, as part of our ongoing strategy, we may seek additional collaborative arrangements for certain of our development programs and/or seek to expand existing collaborations to cover additional commercialization and/or development activities. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of the applicable intellectual property, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. No assurance can be given that any efforts we make to seek additional collaborative arrangements will be successfully completed on a timely basis or at all. \nOur ability to execute on our long-term strategy depends in part on our ability to engage in transactions and collaborations with other entities that add to our pipeline or provide us with new commercial opportunities. \nTo achieve our long-term business objectives, we seek to license or acquire products, product candidates and other technologies that have the potential to complement our ongoing research and development efforts, access emerging technologies and license or acquire pipeline assets. These transactions may be similar to prior transactions, may be structured differently than prior transactions, or may involve larger transactions or later-stage assets. We have faced and will continue to face significant competition for the acquisition of rights to these types of products, product candidates and other technologies from a variety of other companies, some of which have significantly more financial resources and experience in business development activities than we have. In addition, investors and non-profit organizations may be willing to provide capital to the companies that control additional products, product candidates or technologies, which may provide incentives for companies to advance these products, product candidates or technologies independently. Also, the cost of acquiring, in-licensing or otherwise obtaining rights to such products, product candidates or other technologies has grown dramatically in recent years and may be at levels that we cannot afford or that we believe are not justified by market potential. As a result, we \nmay not be able to acquire, in-license or otherwise obtain rights to additional products, product candidates or other technologies on acceptable terms or at all. \nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or future acquisitions of businesses or technologies, and the integration following any such acquisition may disrupt our business and management.\nEffectively integrating acquired businesses, technologies and exclusive licenses is challenging. We may not realize the benefits anticipated from our external innovation transactions, including the value of Alpine’s pipeline and candidates, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Achieving the anticipated benefits of any transaction and successfully integrating acquired businesses or technologies, including Alpine, involves a number of risks, including: \n•failure to successfully develop and commercialize the acquired products, product candidates or technologies or to achieve other strategic objectives;\n•delays or inability to progress preclinical programs into clinical development or unfavorable data from clinical trials evaluating the acquired or licensed product or product candidates;\n•difficulty in integrating the products, product candidates, technologies, business operations and personnel of an acquired asset or company;\n•disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from daily operations or other opportunities and challenges;\n•the potential loss of key employees of an acquired company; \n•entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n•potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed products, product candidate or technology, including problems, liabilities or challenges with respect to intellectual property, clinical or non-clinical data, safety, accounting practices, employee, or third-party relations and other known and unknown liabilities;\n•liability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;\n•exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition or license, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former equity holders or other third parties; and\n•difficulties in the integration of the acquired company’s departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related procedures and policies.\nAcquisitions, licensing arrangements and other strategic transactions are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete an announced acquisition, collaboration or strategic transaction or integrate an acquired or licensed asset, business or technology successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the strategic transaction. We may later incur impairment charges related to assets acquired in any such transaction. Moreover, relatively small changes in key assumptions and judgements may result in the recognition of significant intangible asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. \nEven if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with our strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income. Future strategic transactions could result in increased operating expenses, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment expenses related to goodwill, or impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, all of which could harm our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf our patents do not protect our products or our products infringe third-party patents, we could be subject to litigation which could result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products, substantial damages, or circumvention of our patents by third parties. \nWe own and/or control numerous issued patents and pending patent applications in the U.S., as well as counterparts in other countries. Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain and defend U.S. and foreign patents covering our products, their uses and our processes, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot be certain that any patents will issue from our pending patent applications or, even if patents issue or have issued, that the issued claims will provide us with adequate protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable. U.S. and foreign patent applications typically are maintained in confidence for a period of time after they initially are filed with the applicable patent office. Consequently, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file patent applications on our products or product candidates or their use. If a third-party has an earlier filed patent application relating to our product or product candidates, their uses, or a similar invention, we may be unable to obtain an issued patent from our application.\nDue to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity, and enforceability of patents covering pharmaceutical and biotechnological inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. \nWe have many pending patent applications covering our products. These pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability. Our patents may be challenged by third parties and certain of our patents have been challenged. This could result in the patent being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or the third party may circumvent any such issued patents, including through compulsory licensing mechanisms. When market exclusivity ends or if our patents are circumvented, generic versions of our medicines may be approved and marketed, which could cause substantial and rapid declines in the sales of our products. \nOur patents or patents we license might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from developing competing products. For instance, issued patents, or patents that may issue in the future, (i) relating to our small molecules may be limited to a particular molecule or molecules and may not cover similar molecules that have similar clinical properties, and (ii) relating to cell or genetic therapies may not cover similar technologies that would allow competitors to achieve similar results. Consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property.\nThe laws of many foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S. We, like many companies in our segment of the pharmaceutical industry, have encountered challenges in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Difficulties or preclusion from protecting our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions, including through compulsory licensing, could substantially harm our business.\nBecause of the extensive time required for the discovery, development, testing and regulatory review of product candidates, it is possible that a patent may expire before a product candidate can be commercialized, or a patent may expire or remain in effect for only a short period following commercialization of such product candidate. This would result in a minimal or non-existent period of patent exclusivity. If our product candidates are not commercialized significantly ahead of the expiration date of any applicable patent, or if we have no patent protection on such product candidates, then, to the extent available we would rely on other forms of exclusivity, such as data exclusivity or orphan drug exclusivity.\nUncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes that are inherently costly and unpredictable. \nThere is considerable uncertainty within our industry about the validity, scope, and enforceability of many issued patents in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world, and, to date, the law and practice remains in flux both in the agencies that grant patents and in the courts. We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope and validity of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents might be asserted as being infringed by the manufacture, use and sale of our products.\nThere has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation and other disputes in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Litigation, arbitrations, administrative proceedings, and other legal actions with private parties and governmental authorities concerning patents and other intellectual property rights may be protracted, expensive, and distracting to management. Competitors may sue us as a way of delaying the introduction of our products or to remove our products from the market. Any litigation, including litigation related to Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDA”), litigation related to 505(b)(2) applications, interference proceedings to determine priority of inventions, derivations proceedings, inter partes review, oppositions to patents in foreign countries, litigation against our collaborators or similar actions, may be costly and time consuming and could harm our business. We expect that litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our consolidated financial statements.\nOn July 22, 2022, we filed a lawsuit against Lupin in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 10,646,481 (“the ’481 patent”), 8,883,206 (“the ’206 patent”), 10,272,046 (“the ’046 patent”), and 11,147,770 (“the ’770 patent”). The lawsuit follows our receipt of a Notice Letter on June 9, 2022, advising that Lupin had submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking approval to manufacture and market a generic version of KALYDECO granules in the U.S. The Notice Letter indicated that Lupin submitted a “Paragraph IV” certification to the FDA in which Lupin asserts that the ’481 patent, the ’206 patent, and the ’046 patent are invalid or would not be infringed by Lupin’s generic product. On February 28, 2023, U.S. Patent No. 11,564,916 (“the ‘916 patent”) was listed in the Orange Book as covering KALYDECO granules. By letter dated April 25, 2023, Lupin notified us that it had amended its ANDA to include a Paragraph IV certification with respect to the ’916 patent. On May 26, 2023, we filed a lawsuit against Lupin in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of the ’916 patent. On October 11, 2023, U.S. Patent No. 11,752,106 (the “’106 patent”) was listed in the Orange Book as covering KALYDECO granules. By letter dated February 27, 2024, Lupin notified Vertex that it had amended its ANDA to include a Paragraph IV certification with respect to the ‘106 patent. On April 11, 2024, Vertex filed a lawsuit against Lupin in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of the ‘106 patent. The Court subsequently entered a scheduling order, which consolidated the lawsuit asserting infringement of the ‘106 patent with the earlier filed lawsuits asserting infringement of the ‘481, ‘206, ‘046, ‘770, and ‘916 patents. A three-day trial is scheduled for September 15, 2025. Other than the ’770 patent, which was listed in the Orange Book on April 14, 2022, Lupin does not appear to challenge our other U.S. patents covering KALYDECO granules, the last of which expires on August 5, 2027. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the litigation, Lupin cannot receive final approval of its ANDA before that date. We intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to KALYDECO granules and the ’481, ’206, ’046, ’770, ’916, and ’106 patents. \nCRISPR has licensed certain rights to a worldwide patent portfolio that covers various aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 editing platform technology including, for example, compositions of matter and methods of use in targeting or cutting DNA from Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier, one of the named inventors of this patent portfolio. The patent portfolio also has named inventors who assigned their rights to the CVC Group. For example, in connection with their collaboration, Novartis and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. have reportedly obtained a license to this patent portfolio in certain fields. Both the CVC Group and Broad have obtained granted patents that purport to cover aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 editing platform technology. Patents and patent applications in this patent portfolio have been the subject of numerous contentious proceedings in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions, including interference proceedings in the USPTO between the CVC Group and (separately) Broad, Sigma-Aldrich and ToolGen. On February 28, 2021, the USPTO issued a decision in Interference No. 106, 115, concluding that Broad invented certain applications of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in eukaryotic cells before the CVC Group. The CVC Group has appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. If the decision is upheld on appeal (including a potential subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court), Broad would maintain its granted patents directed to those applications CRISPR/Cas9 technology in eukaryotic cells, and the CVC Group’s pending patent applications directed to that subject matter would not proceed to grant. We can give no assurances to the ultimate outcome of these proceedings or the disputes between the CVC Group and Broad, Sigma-Aldrich and ToolGen. In December 2023, we entered into an agreement with Editas, providing us a non-exclusive sublicense to certain patents relating to CRISPR/Cas9 technology owned by Broad and Harvard, which are licensed to Editas.\nIn addition to Broad, other third parties have filed patent applications claiming CRISPR/Cas9-related inventions and may allege that they invented one or more of the inventions claimed by the CVC Group. Thus, the USPTO may, in the future, \ndeclare an interference between certain CVC Group patent applications and one or more patent applications. Third parties could seek to assert their patents, if issued, against us based on our CRISPR/Cas9-based activities, including commercialization. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, could involve substantial litigation expense and could result in a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In that event, we could be unable to further develop and commercialize CASGEVY or other products that we may develop using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology we license from CRISPR.\nTo the extent that valid present or future third-party patents or other intellectual property rights cover our products, product candidates or technologies, we or our strategic collaborators may seek licenses or other agreements from the holders of such rights to avoid or settle legal claims. Such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, which may hinder our ability to, or prevent us from being able to, manufacture and market our products. Payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. \nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee’s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. \nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. \nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. \nRisks Related To Our Operations\nIf we fail to scale our operations to accommodate growth, our business may suffer. \nWe have expanded and are continuing to expand our global operations and capabilities, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational, research and development and financial infrastructure. To effectively manage our business, we need to continue to adapt as our business grows in scale and complexity across multiple disease states, modalities, and geographies, including by: \n•implement and clearly communicating our corporate-wide strategies;\n•enhancing our operational and financial infrastructure, including expansion of our controls over data, records and information;\n•enhancing our operational, administrative, financial and management processes, including our cross-functional decision-making processes and our budget prioritization systems;\n•effectively growing, training and managing our global employee base; and\n•expanding our compliance and legal resources.\nA variety of risks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have expanded our international operations over the past several years to market our medicines and expand our research and development capabilities. New laws and industry codes in the E.U. and elsewhere have expanded transparency requirements regarding payments and transfers of value to healthcare professionals, requirements surrounding patient-level clinical trial data, the protection of personal data and increased sanctions for violations. Collectively, our expansion and these new requirements are adding to our compliance costs and potentially exposes us to sanctions in the event of an infringement or failure to report in these jurisdictions. In addition, a significant portion of our commercial supply chain, including sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing, is located in China and the E.U. Consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries, including risks relating to intellectual property protections and business interruptions. Risks associated with operating a global biotechnology company include: \n•differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;\n•varying reimbursement regimes and difficulties or the inability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign countries in a timely manner;\n•differing patient treatment infrastructures, particularly since our business is focused on the treatment of serious diseases that affect relatively smaller numbers of patients and are typically prescribed by specialist physicians;\n•collectability of accounts receivable;\n•changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements, the risks of which appear to have increased in the current political environment;\n•economic weakness, including recession and inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n•differing levels of enforcement and/or recognition of contractual and intellectual property rights;\n•circulation of unauthorized copy versions of our medicines that infringe our intellectual property rights;\n•governments seeking to override our intellectual property rights through the introduction of compulsory license or similar mechanisms; \n•complying with local laws and regulations, which can change significantly over time;\n•foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n•foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in reduced revenues or increased operating expenses, and other obligations incident to doing business or operating in another country;\n•workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n•reliance on third-party vendors, distributors and suppliers;\n•import and export licensing requirements, tariffs, and other trade and travel restrictions;\n•global or regional public health emergencies that could affect our operations or business;\n•production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n•business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese risks are increased with respect to countries such as China that have substantially different local laws and business practices and weaker protections for intellectual property. In particular, there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and various other countries, including China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, taxes, and other limitations on cross-border operations. The U.S. government has made and continues to make significant additional changes in U.S. trade policy and may continue to take future actions that could negatively impact U.S. \ntrade. For example, legislation has been introduced in Congress to limit certain U.S. biotechnology companies from using equipment or services produced or provided by select Chinese biotechnology companies, and others in Congress have advocated for the use of existing executive branch authorities to limit those Chinese service providers’ ability to engage in business in the U.S. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, what products and services may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. If we are unable to obtain or use services from existing service providers or become unable to export or sell our products to any of our customers or service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur revenues are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. Although we have a foreign currency risk management program, our efforts to reduce currency exchange volatility may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. \nIn addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the FCPA. We also are subject to import/export control laws. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and corresponding bad publicity and negative perception of our company in foreign countries.\nOur business has a substantial risk of product liability claims and other litigation liability. \nWe are or may be involved in various legal proceedings, including securities/shareholder matters and claims related to product liability, intellectual property, employment law, competition law, data privacy, and breach of contract. Such proceedings may involve claims for, or the possibility of, damages or fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief, including civil or criminal fines and penalties. If any of these legal proceedings were to result in an adverse outcome, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nFor example, we pay royalties on certain sales of TRIKAFTA/KAFTRIO, SYMDEKO/SYMKEVI, KALYDECO, ORKAMBI and ALYFTREK pursuant to our agreement with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. The third-party to whom the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has assigned rights to receive these royalty payments has made public statements related to the calculation of royalties associated with ALYFTREK. Based on the agreement between Vertex and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, we believe the third party is wrong. If any potential future adversarial proceedings were not resolved in our favor, however, we could be required to pay a higher royalty percentage on ALYFTREK sales than we currently expect, and our future cost of goods with respect to ALYFTREK could increase above our current expectations.\nThe use of our approved products and our product candidates exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims may be brought against us by people participating in clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers, or others selling or coming in contact with our products or our product candidates. There is a risk that our products or our product candidates may induce adverse events. For instance, the product labels for TRIKAFTA and ALYFTREK include a boxed warning regarding liver injury and liver failure. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n•Decreased demand for our approved products, such as TRIKAFTA and ALYFTREK, or any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval;\n•Inability to successfully commercialize approved products;\n•Impairment of our business reputation and exposure to adverse publicity;\n•New or increased warnings on our product labels;\n•Withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n•Costs as a result of related litigation;\n•Distraction of management’s attention from our primary business;\n•Substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; and\n•Loss of revenue.\nWe have product liability insurance and clinical trial insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate to cover this risk. However, our insurance may not provide adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. If a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as pay uncovered damage awards and these damages could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct significant financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity is likely to result.\nA breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business. \nWe maintain and rely extensively on information technology systems and network infrastructures for the effective operation of our business. In the course of our business, we collect, store, and transmit confidential information (including personal information and intellectual property), and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such confidential information. A disruption, infiltration, or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, employee theft or misuse, power disruptions, natural disasters, floods or accidents could cause breaches of data security and loss of critical data, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business and subject us to both private and governmental causes of action. While we have implemented security measures to minimize these risks to our data and information technology systems and have adopted a business continuity plan to deal with a disruption to our information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information systems will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business. In addition, we maintain cyber liability insurance, however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our systems and those of critical third parties.\nCyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. They are often carried out by well-resourced and skilled parties, including nation states, organized crime groups, “hacktivists” and employees or contractors acting carelessly or with malicious intent. Cyber-attacks include deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, malicious websites, the use of social engineering, and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data. Cyber-attacks also include manufacturing, hardware or software supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of products or products produced for contract manufacturing or lead to a data privacy or security breach. Our business partners face similar risks and when they experience a security breach of their systems, our security can be adversely affected. Similar to other companies, we have experienced immaterial cybersecurity incidents, including temporary service interruptions of third-party suppliers. In addition, our increased use of cloud technologies heightens these third party and other operational risks, and any failure by cloud or other technology service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption, or loss of confidential or propriety information. A significant portion of our workforce continues to leverage hybrid work. Risk of cyber-attack is increased with employees working remotely. Remote work increases the risk we may be vulnerable to cybersecurity-related events such as phishing attacks and other security threats.\nWe rely on third parties to carry out our operations. Failure to maintain our third-party relationships or challenges at or with these third parties could materially harm our business.\nOur business depends on relationships with third parties for a variety of functions, including activities critical to supply and manufacturing, commercialization, research and development, and technology. Failure by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations, or any disruption in the relationship between Vertex and these third parties, could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, these third parties are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are out of our control. When one of our third parties encounters financial, operational, or other difficulties, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nIf we fail to attract and retain skilled employees, our business could be materially harmed.\nDue to the highly technical nature of our drug discovery and development activities, we require the services of highly qualified and trained scientists who have the skills necessary to conduct these activities. In addition, we need to attract and retain employees with experience in development, marketing and commercialization of medicines and therapies, including cell and genetic therapies. We provide stock-related compensation benefits to all of our key employees that vest over time and therefore induce them to remain with us and have entered into employment agreements with some executives. However, the employment agreements can be terminated by the executive on relatively short notice. The value to employees of stock-related benefits that vest over time can be significantly affected by movements in our stock price and business performance, and may, at any point in time, be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. We face intense competition for our personnel from our competitors and other companies throughout our industry, especially with respect to employees with expertise in cell or genetic therapies. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. Moreover, the growth of local biotechnology companies and the expansion of major pharmaceutical companies into the Boston area has increased competition for the available pool of skilled employees, especially in technical fields. The high cost of living can make it difficult to attract employees to our global headquarters in Boston and our international headquarters in London. Challenges could adversely affect our operations and financial results if we do not have sufficient staff to perform necessary functions. In addition, the available pool of skilled employees would be further reduced if immigration laws change in a manner that increases restrictions on immigration. Our ability to continue to commercialize our products and achieve our research and development objectives depends on our ability to respond effectively to these demands. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, our operations would be seriously harmed.\nMost of our operations, including our research and development activities, are conducted in a limited number of facilities. If any of our major facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, due to an earthquake, flood, severe storms, fire or similar event, our operations could be seriously harmed. For example, our corporate headquarters, as well as additional leased space that we use for certain logistical and laboratory operations and manufacturing, are located in a flood zone along the Massachusetts coast. We have adopted business continuity plans to address most crises. However, if we are unable to fully implement our business continuity plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data and/or an inability to perform vital corporate functions, which could result in a significant disruption in our research, development, manufacturing and/or commercial activities, large expenses to repair or replace the facility and/or the loss of critical data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we maintain property insurance, however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential losses that may result from an interruption to our operations.\nThe use of social media platforms and artificial intelligence tools presents risks and challenges. \nSocial media is being used by third parties to communicate about our products and product candidates and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. We believe that members of the communities supporting serious diseases may be more active on social media as compared to other patient populations due to the demographics of those patient populations. Social media practices in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, a product or a product candidate, which could result in reporting obligations. In addition, our employees may engage on social media in ways that may not comply with legal or regulatory requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets and other intellectual property, or result in public disclosure of protected personal information. There is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. Negative sentiment about us or our business shared over social media, or misinformation disseminated from fraudulent accounts impersonating our employees or our business, or otherwise, could harm our business and reputation, whether or not it is based in fact. Certain data protection regulations, such as the GDPR, apply to personal data contained on social media. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face regulatory actions or incur harm to our business, including damage to our reputation. Similar risks relating to inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or inaccurate information appearing in the public domain may also apply from our employees engaging with and use of new artificial intelligence tools, such as ChatGPT.\nRisks Related to Financial Results and Holding Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate.\nMarket prices for securities of companies such as ours are highly volatile. From January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, our common stock traded between $377.85 and $519.88 per share. The market for our stock, like that of other companies in the biotechnology industry, has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. The future market price of our securities could be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as:\n•the information contained in our quarterly earnings releases, including updates regarding our commercialized products or our product candidates, our net product revenues and operating expenses for completed periods and financial guidance regarding future periods;\n•announcements of FDA actions with respect to our therapies or those of our competitors, or regulatory filings for our therapies or those of our competitors, or announcements of interim or final results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies relating to our therapies or those of our competitors;\n•announcements we make or commentary by public equity analysts with respect to clinical development of the product candidates in our pain program;\n•developments in domestic and international governmental policy or regulation, for example, relating to drug pricing and tax law changes;\n•technological innovations or the introduction of new drugs by our competitors;\n•government regulatory action;\n•public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or our competitors;\n•developments in patent or other intellectual property rights or announcements relating to these matters; \n•information disclosed by third parties regarding our business or products;\n•developments relating specifically to other companies and market conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks or stocks in general;\n•business development, capital structuring or financing activities; and\n•general worldwide or national economic, political and capital market conditions, including as a result of inflation and rapid fluctuations in interest rates.\nFollowing periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, stockholder derivative lawsuits and securities class action litigation are common. Such litigation, if instituted against us or our officers and directors, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\nOur effective tax rate fluctuates, and changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties, unfavorable resolution to the tax positions we have taken or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our future taxable income.\nOur effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate globally. Our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors, including changes in the mix of our profitability from country to country, tax authority examinations/audits of our tax filings, adjustments to the value of our uncertain tax positions, changes in accounting for income taxes, and changes in tax laws or modifications of treaties in various jurisdictions. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate that is significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations.\nVarious jurisdictions in which the group operates, including the U.K. and the E.U. member states have agreed to implement the minimum tax component (“Pillar Two”) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (the “OECD’s”), global international tax reform initiative that aims to reform international taxation policies and ensure that multinational companies pay taxes wherever they operate and generate profits. Although aspects of Pillar Two have been \nimplemented that affect accounting periods withing our group starting on or after December 31, 2023, the full impact of this initiative on our effective tax rate will depend on the timing of implementation within each country in which we operate, the exact nature of each country’s implementation legislation, guidance and regulations thereon, and their application by tax authorities either prospectively or retrospectively. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two guidance, pending legislative adoption by individual countries, including those in which we do business.\nWe are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions, and local tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the probable outcomes of these audits to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, and we have established contingency reserves for material tax exposures. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation.\nOur operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. Our revenues are primarily dependent on the amount of net product revenues from sales of our CF medicines. Our total net product revenues could vary on a quarterly basis based on, among other factors, the timing of orders from our significant customers. Additional factors that have caused quarterly fluctuations to our operating results in recent years include variable amounts of revenues; expenses resulting from our significant investments in research and development, acquired in-process research and development, and commercialization activities; changes in the fair values of our strategic investments, and contingent consideration liabilities; charges for excess and obsolete inventories; and our provision for income taxes. Our revenues also are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. Although we have a foreign currency risk management program, our efforts to reduce currency exchange volatility may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business may affect our operating results, often in unpredictable ways. Our quarterly results also could be materially affected by significant charges, which may or may not be similar to charges we have experienced in the past. Most of our operating expenses relate to our research and development activities, do not vary directly with the amount of revenues and are difficult to adjust in the short term. As a result, if revenues in a particular quarter are below expectations, we are unlikely to reduce operating expenses proportionately for that quarter. These examples are only illustrative and other risks, including those discussed in these “Risk Factors,” could also cause fluctuations in our reported financial results. Our operating results during any one period do not necessarily suggest the results of future periods.\nWe expect that results from our clinical development activities and the clinical development activities of our competitors will continue to be released periodically, and may result in significant volatility in the price of our common stock. \nAny new information regarding our products and product candidates, or competitive products or potentially competitive product candidates, can substantially affect investors’ perceptions regarding our future prospects. We, our collaborators, and our competitors periodically provide updates regarding drug and therapy development programs, typically through press releases, conference calls and presentations at medical conferences. These periodic updates often include interim or final results from clinical trials conducted by us or our competitors and/or information about our or our competitors’ expectations regarding regulatory filings and submissions as well as future clinical development of our products or product candidates, competitive products or potentially competitive product candidates. The timing of the release of information by us regarding our drug and therapy development programs is often beyond our control and is influenced by the timing of receipt of data from our clinical trials and by the general preference among pharmaceutical companies to disclose clinical data during medical conferences. In addition, the information disclosed about our clinical trials, or our competitors’ clinical trials, may be based on interim rather than final data that may involve interpretation difficulties and may in any event not accurately predict final results. The release of such information may result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFuture indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, and the terms of our credit agreements impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks.\nIn July 2022, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $500.0 million revolving credit facility. If we borrow under our current credit agreement or any future credit agreements, such indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, \nas well as other factors that are beyond our control. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain financial covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant. Further, the credit agreement includes negative covenants, subject to exceptions, restricting or limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, engage in certain investment, acquisition and disposition transactions, and enter into transactions with affiliates. As a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business. Failure to comply with the covenants could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owed under the credit agreements and/or our finance leases and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, our obligations under the credit agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\nIssuances of additional shares of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 256.9 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2024, we also had 2.7 million unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”), 0.9 million unvested performance stock units (“PSUs”) at target, and outstanding options to purchase 1.6 million shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $156.36 per share. \nThe majority of our unvested RSUs are likely to vest based on our employees’ continued employment. The number of PSUs that vest is dependent on a potential range of shares issuable pursuant to certain financial and non-financial milestones, and our employees’ continued employment. Outstanding vested options are likely to be exercised if the market price of our common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price. \nIn addition, we may issue additional common stock or restricted securities in the future as part of financing activities or business development activities and any such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our then-existing shareholders. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. The issuance of restricted common stock or common stock upon exercise of any outstanding options would be dilutive, and may cause the market price for a share of our common stock to decline.\nThere can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares of common stock or that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices.\nIn February 2023, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of our common stock from time to time through open market or privately negotiated transactions, of which $1.6 billion has been repurchased as of December 31, 2024. Our stock repurchases will depend upon, among other factors, market conditions, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that we may deem relevant. We can provide no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices, if at all.\nWe have adopted provisions in our articles of organization and by-laws and are subject to Massachusetts corporate laws that may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace members of our board or to effectuate certain types of business combinations involving us.\nProvisions of our articles of organization, by-laws and Massachusetts state laws may frustrate any attempt to remove or replace members of our current Board of Directors and may discourage certain types of business combinations involving us. Our by-laws allow the Board of Directors to adjourn any meetings of shareholders prior to the time the meeting has been convened. We may issue shares of any class or series of preferred stock in the future without shareholder approval and upon such terms as our Board of Directors may determine. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Massachusetts state law also prohibits us from engaging in specified business combinations with an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions, unless the combination is approved or consummated in a prescribed manner, and places restrictions on voting by any shareholder who acquires 20% or more of the aggregate shareholder voting power without approval by non-interested shareholders.
