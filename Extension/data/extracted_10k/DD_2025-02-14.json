      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS \nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as otherwise noted by the context, the terms \"DuPont\" or \"Company\" used herein mean DuPont de Nemours, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nDuPont is a Delaware corporation formed in 2015 (formerly, DowDuPont Inc.), for the purpose of effecting an all-stock merger of equals transactions between The Dow Chemical Company (\"TDCC\") and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (\"EID\"). Effective August 31, 2017, pursuant to the merger of equals transaction contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017 (\"DWDP Merger Agreement\"), TDCC and EID each merged with subsidiaries of DowDuPont Inc. (\"DowDuPont\") and, as a result, TDCC and EID became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the \"DWDP Merger\"). Prior to the DWDP Merger, DowDuPont did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the DWDP Merger Agreement. For purposes of DowDuPont's financial statement presentation, TDCC was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the DWDP Merger and EID's assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value as of the DWDP Merger Effectiveness Time. \nOn April 1, 2019, the Company completed the separation of the materials science business through the spin-off of Dow Inc., (“Dow”) including Dow’s subsidiary TDCC (the “Dow Distribution”). On June 1, 2019, the Company completed the separation of the agriculture business through the spin-off of Corteva, Inc. (“Corteva”) including Corteva’s subsidiary EID, (the “Corteva Distribution\" and together with the Dow Distribution, the “DWDP Distributions”). Effective January 1, 2023, Corteva’s subsidiary EID changed its name to EIDP, Inc. (“EIDP”), and therefore references to EID reflect this name change as appropriate. \nDuPont is a global innovation leader with technology-based materials and solutions that help transform industries and everyday life by applying diverse science and expertise to help customers advance their best ideas and deliver essential innovations in key markets including electronics, transportation, construction, water, healthcare and worker safety. At December 31, 2024, the Company has subsidiaries in about 50 countries worldwide and manufacturing operations in about 24 countries. See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the location of the Company's sales and property.\nSignificant Transformational Divestitures\nOn February 1, 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of the Nutrition & Biosciences (“N&B”) business to International Flavors & Fragrance Inc. (“IFF”) in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the “N&B Transaction”) that resulted in IFF issuing shares to DuPont stockholders. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nOn February 18, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered an agreement on February 17, 2022, (the \"Transaction Agreement\") with Celanese Corporation (\"Celanese\") for divestiture of the majority of DuPont’s historic Mobility & Materials (“M&M”) segment, (the “M&M Divestiture”). The Auto Adhesives & Fluids, MultibaseTM and Tedlar® product line, which were part of the historic M&M segment, are referred to as the \"Retained Businesses\". On November 1, 2022, DuPont and Celanese completed the M&M Divestiture and DuPont received cash proceeds of $11 billion which was subject to transaction adjustments in accordance with the Transaction Agreement. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \nAs part of its announcement on February 18, 2022 regarding the M&M Divestiture, DuPont also announced the Board of Directors' approval for the divestiture of the Delrin® acetal homopolymer (H-POM) business (the \"Delrin® Divestiture\"). On November 1, 2023, the Company closed the sale of the Delrin® business to TJC LP (\"TJC\"), (the “Delrin® Divestiture”). The Delrin® Divestiture together with the M&M Divestiture, are referred to as the “M&M Divestitures”.\nIntended Electronics Separation\nOn May 22, 2024, DuPont announced a plan to separate each of its Electronics and Water businesses in a tax-free manner to its shareholders, (the “Previously Intended Business Separations”). On January 15, 2025, DuPont announced it is targeting November 1, 2025, for the completion of the intended separation of the Electronics business (the “Intended Electronics Separation”). DuPont also announced that it would retain the Water business. The Intended Electronics Separation will not require a shareholder vote and is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval by DuPont's Board of Directors, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, applicable regulatory approvals and satisfactory completion of financing. \nFinancial Flexibility and Return of Excess Capital\nFollowing the M&M Divestiture, in November 2022, DuPont redeemed in full $2.5 billion in fixed-rate long term senior unsecured notes due November 2023. Following the announcement of the Previously Intended Business Separations, in the second quarter 2024, DuPont completed a partial redemption of $650 million aggregate principal amount of its 2038 Notes and entered into two forward-starting fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements (“2024 Swaps”) to hedge the changes in the fair value of the Company’s long-term debt due to interest rate change movements. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, DuPont's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase and retirement of up to $5 billion of common stock, (the \"$5B Share Buyback Program”). In the third quarter 2023, the Company completed the repurchase and retired a total of 46.8 million shares of common stock with $250 million of such repurchases completing the $1 billion share repurchase program approved in February 2022 and the remaining $3 billion under the $5B Share Buyback Program. \nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the remaining $2 billion of buyback authority under the $5B Share Buyback Program repurchasing 27.9 million shares. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase and retirement of up to $1 billion of common stock (the \"$1B Share Buyback Program”). The $1B Share Buyback Program terminates on June 30, 2025, unless extended or shortened by the Board of Directors.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, DuPont completed an accelerated stock repurchase transaction (“ASR\") for the repurchase of about $500 million of common stock. In total, the Company repurchased 6.9 million shares at an average price of $71.96 per share under the transaction. In connection with the Previously Intended Business Separations and continuing in light of the Intended Electronics Separation, DuPont announced its intent not to complete the remaining $500 million in share buyback authority under the $1B Share Buyback Program. \nFor more information, see the discussion of Liquidity & Capital Resources in See Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTargeted Acquisitions\nOn August 1, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Spectrum Plastics Group (“Spectrum”) from AEA Investors (the “Spectrum Acquisition”) which is part of Industrial Solutions within the Electronics & Industrial segment.\nOn July 28, 2024, DuPont completed the acquisition of Donatelle Plastics, LLC (\"Donatelle Plastics\"), (the \"Donatelle Plastics Acquisition\"), which is being integrated into Industrial Solutions within the Electronics & Industrial segment. \nSee Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nWater District Settlement Agreement\nIn April 2024, the $1.185B Water District Settlement became final and therefore DuPont’s $400 million contribution, plus interest, to the Water District Settlement Fund is reflected as a cash outflow within cash flows from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION \nThe M&M Divestitures represent a strategic shift with a related major impact on DuPont's operations and results.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report present the financial position of DuPont as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the results of operations of DuPont for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows giving effect to the M&M Divestitures as if it had occurred on January 1, 2022, with the historical financial results of the businesses divested as part of the M&M Divestitures (the \"M&M Businesses\") reflected as discontinued operations, as applicable.

The new assets were online and operational in early 2024 and the total investment was approximately $400 million.\nCORPORATE & OTHER\nCorporate & Other includes sales and activity of the Retained Businesses including the Auto Adhesives & Fluids, MultibaseTM and Tedlar® product lines. Corporate & Other includes DuPont's equity interest in Derby Holdings Group related to the Delrin® Divestiture. The results of Corporate & Other also include the sales and activity of certain divested businesses including the operations of the Biomaterials business unit divested in May 2022. Corporate & Other also includes certain enterprise and governance activities including non-allocated corporate overhead costs and support functions, leveraged services, non-business aligned litigation expenses and other costs not absorbed by reportable segments.\nThe costs of the M&M Businesses that are classified as discontinued operations include only direct operating expenses incurred prior to the M&M Divestiture on November 1, 2022 and costs which the Company stopped incurring upon the close of the Delrin® Divestiture. Indirect costs, such as those related to corporate and shared service functions previously allocated to the M&M Businesses, do not meet the criteria for discontinued operations and remain reported within continuing operations. A portion of these indirect costs related to activities the Company continues to undertake post-closing of the M&M Divestitures, and for which it is reimbursed (“Future Reimbursable Indirect Costs”). Future Reimbursable Indirect Costs are reported within continuing operations in Corporate & Other but are excluded from Operating EBITDA as defined below. The remaining portion of these indirect costs are not subject to future reimbursement (“Stranded Costs”). Stranded Costs are reported within continuing operations in Corporate & Other and are included within Operating EBITDA.\nThe Company's measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is Operating EBITDA as this is the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") assesses performance and allocates resources. The Company defines Operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., “Income from continuing operations before income taxes\") before interest, depreciation, amortization, non-operating pension / other post-employment benefits (“OPEB”) / charges, and foreign exchange gains / losses, excluding Future Reimbursable Indirect Costs, and adjusted for significant items.\nINDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION RESULTS\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by business or major product line.\nSales by geographic region are included within Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\", \"Results of Operations.\" See Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding total net sales and total assets by segment, as well as net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region.\nSIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITION\nIn 2024, no significant portion of the Company's sales was dependent upon a single customer. The markets in which the Company participates compete primarily through technology, range of products and services, performance, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, service and support. The Company provides extensive support, technical services and testing services for its customers, in addition to new product development. The Company believes that its proprietary product and process technologies, robust product and application development pipelines, customer intimacy, global manufacturing capability and local service capability enable it to compete successfully.\nDuPont is a multi-industrial company and is subject to competition across all product and service areas. Key competitors include but are not limited to:\n•Electronics & Industrial: Element Solutions, Entegris, Fujifilm, Henkel, JSR, Merck KGaA, MKS Instruments, and Resonac.\n•Water & Protection: 3M, Honeywell, Hydranautics, Kingspan, Kolon, Lanxess, Owens-Corning, Ecolab, Avient, Toray, Teijin, and Yantai.\nAgainst this competitive backdrop, value-in-use is the primary driver of price for the Company’s products, although price is impacted by many factors including, among others, fluctuations in supply and demand, and availability and cost of key manufacturing inputs including raw materials and energy. \nSOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF MAJOR RAW MATERIALS\nThe Company uses a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacturing of products. The prices of raw materials are driven by global supply and demand. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary cost pressures. The Company actively works to mitigate impacts of such conditions. \nDISTRIBUTION\nMost products are marketed primarily through the Company's sales organization, although for some product lines, more emphasis is placed on sales through distributors. The Company has a diverse worldwide network which markets and distributes the Company's brands to customers globally. This network consists of the Company's sales and marketing organization partnering with distributors, independent retailers, cooperatives and agents throughout the world.\nBACKLOG \nIn general, the Company does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders and does not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are typically based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. However, from time to time in limited instances the Company does operate against a backlog for certain products, which has in the past resulted, and in the future may result, from the availability of raw materials from third-party suppliers. Therefore, the Company believes that backlog information is generally not meaningful to understanding its overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.\nSEASONALITY\nCertain of the Company's sales are seasonal as consumer electronics and North American and European construction end-market demand generally increases in the second and third fiscal quarters resulting in sales increases in Interconnect Solutions and Shelter Solutions, respectively. This seasonality is partially mitigated by the other products provided by the Company that have no material seasonal effect.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThe Company’s businesses differentially manage their respective intellectual property estates to support Company strategic priorities, which can include leveraging intellectual property within and across product lines. \nTrade Secrets: Trade secrets are an important part of the Company's intellectual property. Many of the processes used to make products are kept as trade secrets which, from time to time, may be licensed to third parties. DuPont vigilantly protects all of its intellectual property including its trade secrets. When the Company discovers that its trade secrets have been unlawfully taken, it reports the matter to governmental authorities for investigation and potential criminal action, as appropriate. In addition, the Company takes measures to mitigate any potential impact, which may include civil actions seeking redress, restitution and/or damages based on loss to the Company and/or unjust enrichment.\nPatents: The Company applies for and obtains patents in many countries, including the U.S., and has access to a large patent portfolio, both owned and licensed. DuPont’s rights under these patents and licenses, as well as the products made and sold under them, are important to the Company in the aggregate. The Company considers various intellectual property protections and strategic business priorities when deciding whether to apply for or maintain a patent.\nThe protection afforded by patents varies based on country, scope of individual patent coverage, as well as the availability of legal remedies in each country and type of patent protection. The term of these patents is approximately twenty years from the filing date in general, but varies depending on country and type of patent protection. DuPont's significant patent estate may be leveraged to align with the Company’s strategic priorities within and across product lines. At December 31, 2024, the Company owned about 12,800 patents and patent applications globally. Approximately 80 percent of the Company’s patent estate has a remaining term of more than 5 years.\nTrademarks: The Company owns or licenses many trademarks that have significant recognition at the consumer retail level and/or the product line to product line level. Ownership rights in trademarks do not expire if the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected.\nENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY MATTERS\nDuPont operates global manufacturing, product handling and distribution facilities that are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations. For more information see: (1) Environmental Proceedings on page 30, (2) Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 37, (3) Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSUSTAINABILITY \nDuPont’s purpose is to empower the world with the essential innovations to thrive. The Company operates within four core values of protecting safety and health; respect for people; conduct in accordance with the highest ethical behavior; and protecting the planet. DuPont’s sustainability strategy is focused on driving innovations to create sustainable solutions that help address the most pressing challenges facing society and the planet; enhancing the sustainability of its operations and facilities; and protecting the health and well-being of its employees and communities. DuPont believes that climate change is an important global environmental issue that presents risks and opportunities. The Company is continuously evaluating opportunities for existing and new product and service offerings to meet the anticipated demands of a low-carbon economy.\nInformation about DuPont’s sustainability-related policies, programs, initiatives and goals is available under Sustainability in the \"About Us\" section of its website. The Company’s 2024 Sustainability Report, which is aligned to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (\"SASB\") frameworks, includes information based on the businesses and facilities owned and operated by the Company during the calendar year 2023. \nAdditional corporate governance information, including DuPont’s amended and restated charter, amended and restated bylaws, corporate governance guidelines, Board committee charters, and code of business conduct and ethics, is available under Corporate Governance in the \"For Investors\" section of the Company’s website. Nothing on the DuPont websites shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nFoundational to the Company’s current and future success is its employees, who drive the Company’s strategic vision, manage operations and develop products. The Company focuses significant attention on attracting, motivating and retaining talent at all levels. Through training and professional development initiatives, promoting a respectful and welcoming culture, and emphasizing the importance of health, safety and well-being, the Company’s aim is to create an environment that fully supports the needs of its employees providing opportunity for financial and career growth, an inclusive and collegial experience and purpose in doing work that matters.\nThe Company is committed to upholding a workplace culture that prioritizes the wellbeing and fulfillment of our employees and strongly believes that this approach not only aligns with our values but also positively impacts our long-term performance. To ensure that the Company is consistently fulfilling this commitment, DuPont regularly gathers feedback from our colleagues and analyzes our progress. Annually, an enterprise-wide engagement survey is conducted, which provides insight into employee morale and aspects of workplace culture like core values, commitment to ethical behavior, teamwork and employee development. \nThe Company is committed to creating a high-performance culture built on continual learning to support the strategic needs of its workforce. The professional growth of our people is essential to the growth of our business. Our annual goal process asks employees to not only identify three key goals around business contributions but also and one goal focused on self-development. The Company has prioritized learning and career development opportunities for leaders and all employees. The Company offers a wide set of training, education and development opportunities, both formally and informally, throughout the year. All employees take part in a mix of on-the-job training and appropriate learning and training opportunities focusing on topics that are the most critical and relevant to each employees’ job function. Employees have the freedom to create meaningful development plans, identify goals, and take steps to achieve them. \nThe Company is committed to ensuring fair access to growth and fulfillment opportunities for its employees and to positively impacting communities in which it operates. In furtherance of these commitments, the Company supports several employee-led resource groups which are open to all employees.\nOrganizational culture is only as strong and resilient as its leaders; therefore, DuPont invests in leadership development. DuPont provides programming to equip leaders with the skills needed to support our employees through effective leadership. Annually, our senior leadership identifies key talent based on performance, potential and aspiration to develop for advancement. \nThe Company's success also depends on the well-being of employees, including physical, mental and emotional health. DuPont employees have access to online health resources through our global wellness provider to help them improve their overall well-being, including a health assessment, healthy habit building and tracking, videos and content to reduce stress and increase resilience, better sleep habits, nutrition guides, company wellness challenges, and financial wellness education. The Company continues to provide no-cost Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\") services to all employees globally and their immediate household members. All employees also have the support of the Company’s Health Services teams, which provides onsite and intranet-based services to support and monitor the health and welfare of employees. The Company’s larger manufacturing and research sites have onsite clinics where employees can get occupational care, first aid treatment, travel vaccinations and referrals for off-site medical care. The Company continuously strives for zero workplace injuries, occupational illnesses and incidents. The Company’s safety metrics are continually measured against this goal, and DuPont’s Environmental, Health, Safety & Sustainability Committee oversees improvements in the Company's health and safety practices. Health Services also assesses health risks across DuPont to find out which health concerns are most important to the Company's employees, conducts medical surveillance exams based on occupational risks and regulatory compliance priorities flagged by DuPont’s Environmental, Health and Safety team. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company employed approximately 24,000 people worldwide. Approximately 34 percent of employees were in Asia Pacific, 16 percent were in the EMEA, 5 percent were in Latin America and 45 percent were in the U.S and Canada. Within the United States, about 6,000 employees were in non-exempt or hourly-rate positions. \nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe Company is subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company's operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond its control. Based on current information, the Company believes that the following identifies the most material risk factors that could affect its operations. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks related to the Intended Electronics Separation\nDuPont may be unable to achieve all the benefits that it expects to achieve from the Intended Electronics Separation, if the Intended Electronics Separation is effected at all. \nThe success of the Intended Electronics Separation ultimately depends on, among other things, DuPont's ability to internally separate the Electronics business in a manner that facilitates the Intended Electronics Separation on a U.S. federal income tax-free basis and enables the future Electronics company as well as “new” DuPont, as a diversified industrials-focused company, (the “FutureCos” and each, a “FutureCo”), to benefit from increased focus and agility in their respective industries.\nDuPont, and each of its businesses, has and continues to benefit from efficiencies through the optimization of its global footprint, leveraging of corporate, procurement and functional services and costs across all of its businesses. While the Intended Electronics Separation is expected to create dis-synergies, the intent is to stand the FutureCos in a way that is favorably competitive for each FutureCo’s respective industry. \nThe separation and distribution transactions necessary to effectuate the Intended Electronics Separation will be complex, costly and time-consuming, and are subject to difficulties, uncertainties and unanticipated risks, each of which may diminish the benefits the Company expects to realize from the Intended Electronics Separation. These include, but are not limited to: \n•delays, both generally and as a result of failure to satisfy all of the required conditions to the Intended Electronics Separation;\n•unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, macroeconomic environment, market conditions or political or regulatory conditions, including as a result of executive orders;\n•difficulties in standing the FutureCos and completing the Intended Electronics Separation in an efficient and effective manner to achieve business opportunities and growth prospects;\n•costs or inefficiencies associated with dis-synergies, including due to increased borrowing costs;\n•the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at the Company as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the Intended Electronics Separation;\n•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process, including with respect to the Intended Electronics Separation;\n•unanticipated issues in creating information technology, communications programs, financial procedures and operations, and other systems, procedures and policies;\n•impact on relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, licensors and other stakeholders;\n•tax costs or inefficiencies associated with the Intended Electronics Separation; and\n•potential negative reactions from the financial markets if the Company fails to complete the Intended Electronics Separation, as currently expected, within the anticipated time frame or at all.\nIf the Intended Electronics Separation is completed, each of the FutureCos will incur ongoing costs of operating as independent companies that will no longer be shared, and each of the FutureCos will be smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than DuPont is today. As a result, the FutureCos may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, be subject to costs that exceed the Company’s estimates and the Intended Electronics Separation may result in existing shareholders divesting the stock of the FutureCos where investment strategies no longer align, which may affect the market price of the respective FutureCos’ common stock following the consummation of the Intended Electronics Separation. Each of these risks may diminish the benefits the Company expects to realize from the Intended Electronics Separation. Further, if the Intended Electronics Separation is ultimately not consummated, the anticipated benefits, operational efficiencies, business opportunities and growth prospects may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of common stock, the revenues, levels of expenses and results of operations of each of the FutureCos may be adversely affected. In addition, the Company will have incurred costs (which may be significant) without realizing the benefits of such transaction. \nThe Intended Electronics Separation may adversely impact DuPont’s ability to access the capital markets and its cost of capital. \nThe Intended Electronics Separation may have the effect of, among other things: \n•requiring the Company to dedicate significant cash flow to the Company’s debt, including, without limitation, the payment of principal and interest, payment of costs associated with the refinance, repayment, redemption, repurchase or exchange of the Company’s outstanding debt, and payment of costs associated with the Intended Electronics Separation, which will reduce funds the Company has available for other purposes;\n•exposing the Company to interest rate risk at the time of refinancing outstanding debt or on the portion of the Company’s debt obligations that are issued at variable rates; \n•increasing the borrowing costs associated with the re-allocation or taking on of new debt; and\n•although the Company expects to maintain investment grade ratings, resulting in downgrades of the Company’s credit ratings leading to increased borrowing costs to the Company. \nDuPont’s primary sources of liquidity to finance operations, including stock repurchases and dividends on its common stock, is cash generated by its businesses and access to the debt capital markets. Further, DuPont is considering potentially repaying, redeeming, repurchasing or exchanging some or all of its senior notes, of which there are about $7.2 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding, with maturities in 2025, 2028, 2038 and 2048. If the Company’s ability to continue to raise money in the debt capital markets is impaired, or if there is a significant increase in the cost of debt, there may be a significant negative effect on the Company’s liquidity. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, it could restrict the Company’s current operations, activities under its current and future stock buyback programs, and the Company’s growth opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. \nIf the intended distribution of the Electronics FutureCo, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then DuPont could be subject to significant tax liability.\nIt is expected that DuPont will receive a tax opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, its tax counsel, as a condition to the distribution, in form and substance acceptable to DuPont, substantially to the effect that, among other things, such distribution along with certain related transactions will qualify for non-recognition treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code,” and such opinion, the “Tax Opinion”). The Tax Opinion is expected to rely on certain facts, assumptions, and undertakings, and certain representations from DuPont and the Electronics FutureCo, regarding the past and future conduct of each of their respective businesses and other matters. Notwithstanding the receipt of the Tax Opinion, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) could determine on audit that the distribution and/or certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the Tax Opinion. If the distribution and/or certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, it is expected that DuPont could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law.\nGenerally, corporate taxes resulting from the failure of the distribution to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be imposed on DuPont. Under a tax matters agreement expected to be entered into between DuPont and the Electronics FutureCo, the responsibility for such taxes may be allocated between the FutureCos under certain circumstances and each FutureCo may be obligated to indemnify the other against any such taxes imposed on it. To the extent that DuPont is responsible for any liability as a result of the failure of the distribution and/or certain related transactions to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there could be a material adverse impact on DuPont’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in reporting periods following the Intended Electronics Separation.\nRisks Relating to the M&M Divestitures, N&B Transaction and the Dow and Corteva Distributions\nDuPont could incur additional tax liabilities if certain internal transactions undertaken in connection with the completed divestiture of a majority of the Mobility & Materials business to Celanese and divestiture of the Delrin® business to TJC (the \"M&M Divestitures\"), fail to qualify for their intended tax treatment.\nPrior to the closing of the M&M Divestitures, DuPont engaged in certain internal reorganization activities to separate into and to separately align the legal entities holding the M&M Business and the Delrin® business for disposition. DuPont has recognized a tax liability pursuant to these reorganization activities related to the M&M Divestitures. However, if certain of these internal reorganization activities fail to qualify for their intended tax treatment under U.S. federal, state, local tax and/or foreign tax law, DuPont could incur additional tax liabilities.\nThe separation and combination of DuPont’s Nutrition & Biosciences business with IFF could result in a significant tax liability to DuPont. \nThe distribution by DuPont to its stockholders of all the issued and outstanding shares of N&B through the Exchange Offer (\"N&B Distribution\") and the merger of N&B with a wholly-owned subsidiary of IFF (\"N&B Merger\") are expected to be tax-free to DuPont stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes (except to the extent that cash was paid to DuPont stockholders in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to the N&B Merger Agreement), and the N&B Contribution, defined below, N&B Distribution, and the one-time payment from N&B to DuPont of approximately $7.3 billion (\"Special Cash Payment\") are expected to result in no recognition of gain or loss by DuPont for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nDuPont received an opinion of counsel and also obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain matters impacting the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the separation and transfer by DuPont of its N&B Business (the “N&B Contribution”), N&B Distribution, Special Cash Payment and certain related transactions. The conclusions of the IRS private letter ruling were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions DuPont authorized and representations DuPont made to the IRS. If any of those assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the IRS private letter ruling may be affected.\nIf the N&B Contribution and N&B Distribution failed to qualify for the treatment described above, DuPont would be required to generally recognize a taxable gain on the transactions and stockholders of DuPont who receive N&B Common Stock (and subsequently, IFF Common Stock) would be subject to tax on their receipt of the N&B Common Stock. Additionally, if the Special Cash Payment or certain internal transactions related to the separation of the Nutrition & Biosciences business fail to qualify for their intended tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state, local tax and/or foreign tax law, DuPont could incur additional tax liabilities.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement by and between DuPont with N&B and IFF, N&B or IFF is generally required to indemnify DuPont for any taxes resulting from the separation of the Nutrition & Biosciences business (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) certain actions taken by N&B or IFF involving the capital stock of N&B or IFF or any assets of the N&B group (excluding actions required by the documents governing the proposed transactions), or (ii) any breach of certain representations and covenants made by N&B or IFF.\nDuPont is subject to continuing contingent tax-related liabilities of Dow and Corteva following the separations and DWDP Distributions.\nAfter the separations and DWDP Distributions, there are several significant areas where the liabilities of Dow and Corteva may become the Company’s obligations, either in whole or in part. For example, to the extent that any subsidiary of the Company was included in the consolidated tax reporting group of either TDCC or EIDP for any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective date of the DWDP Merger, such subsidiary is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire consolidated tax reporting group of TDCC or EIDP, as applicable, for such taxable period. In connection with the separations and DWDP Distributions, DuPont, Dow and Corteva have entered into a Tax Matters Agreement, as amended (the \"DWDP Tax Matters Agreement\"), that allocates the responsibility for prior period consolidated taxes among Dow, Corteva and DuPont. If Dow or Corteva are unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, however, DuPont could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state, local, or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\nIn connection with the separations and DWDP Distributions, certain liabilities are allocated to or retained by DuPont through assumption or indemnification of Dow and/or Corteva, as applicable. If DuPont is required to make payments pursuant to these indemnities to Dow and/or Corteva, DuPont may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, and the Company’s financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, certain liabilities are allocated to or retained by Dow and/or Corteva through assumption or indemnification, or subject to indemnification by other third parties. These indemnities may not be sufficient to insure the Company against the full amount of liabilities, including PFAS Stray Liabilities, allocated to or retained by it, and Dow, Corteva and/or third parties may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the DWDP Separation and Distribution Agreement, the DWDP Employee Matters Agreement, and the DWDP Tax Matters Agreement (collectively, the “Core Agreements”) with Dow and Corteva, as well as the Letter Agreement between DuPont and Corteva, DuPont has agreed to assume, and indemnify Dow and Corteva for, certain liabilities. Payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact the Company’s business. \nThird parties could also seek to hold DuPont responsible for any of the liabilities allocated to Dow and Corteva, including those related to EIDP’s materials science and/or agriculture businesses, or for the conduct of such businesses prior to the distributions, and such third parties could seek damages, other monetary penalties (whether civil or criminal) and/or other \nremedies. Additionally, DuPont generally assumes and is responsible for the payment of the Company’s share of (i) certain liabilities of DowDuPont relating to, arising out of or resulting from certain general corporate matters of DuPont and (ii) certain separation expenses not otherwise allocated to Corteva or Dow (or allocated specifically to it) pursuant to the Core Agreements, and third parties may seek to hold it responsible for Dow’s or Corteva’s share of any such liabilities. Dow and/or Corteva, as applicable, have agreed to indemnify it for such liabilities; however, such indemnities may not be sufficient to protect it against the full amount of such liabilities or from other remedies, and Dow and/or Corteva, as applicable, may not be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. Even if DuPont ultimately succeeds in recovering from Dow and/or Corteva, as applicable, any amounts for which DuPont is held liable, DuPont may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGenerally, as described in Litigation, Environmental Matters and Indemnifications, losses from liabilities related to discontinued and/or divested operations and businesses of EIDP that are not primarily related to its agriculture business or specialty products business, (“Stray Liabilities”), are allocated to or shared by each of Corteva and DuPont. Stray Liabilities include liabilities arising out of actions to the extent related to or resulting from EIDP’s development, testing, manufacture or sale of per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances, (“PFAS Stray Liabilities”), that are not otherwise defended and indemnified by Chemours. \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company has recorded an indemnification liability related to Stray Liabilities. The Company recognizes an indemnification liability when a loss is reasonably probable and can be reasonably estimated. While the Company has established processes and controls over the information to support its accounting for indemnification liabilities with each of Corteva and Dow, the Company is reliant on the accuracy, transparency, completeness and timeliness of information from the applicable party, either Corteva or Dow, that retains direct liability for the underlying matter. Estimating indemnified costs of environmental remediation and compliance activities is particularly difficult since such activities are dependent on the nature of and activity at specific sites; new and evolving analytical, operating and remediation technologies and techniques; agreed action plans; changes in environmental regulations; permissible levels of specific compounds in water, air or soil; enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; and the presence and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had recorded indemnification assets related to Stray Liabilities and other matters. Although the Company believes it is remote, there can be no assurance that any such third-party would have adequate resources to satisfy its indemnification obligation when due, or, would not ultimately be successful in claiming defenses against payment. Even if recovery from the third-party is ultimately successful, DuPont may be temporarily required to bear these losses. Each of these risks could negatively affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See discussion of the Core Agreements in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Litigation, Environmental Matters and Indemnifications in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn January 22, 2021, DuPont, Corteva and Chemours entered into a cost sharing arrangement related to future eligible PFAS costs. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies, including expected performance under and impact of the cost sharing arrangement.\nWhile the cost sharing arrangement related to future PFAS eligible costs reduces uncertainty, its ultimate impact on the Company depends on a number of factors and uncertainties that include, but are not limited to: the achievement, terms and conditions of future agreements, if any, related to the cost sharing arrangement; the outcome of any pending or future litigation related to PFAS or PFOA, including personal injury claims and natural resource damages claims; the extent and cost of ongoing remediation obligations and potential future remediation obligations, including under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; changes in laws and regulations applicable to PFAS chemicals, changes in applicable health advisory levels and in chronic reference doses for PFAS in drinking water; the performance by each of the parties of their respective obligations under the cost sharing arrangement.\nDuPont faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters, including product liability, patent infringement and other intellectual property disputes, contract and commercial litigation, claims for damage or personal injury, antitrust claims, governmental regulations and other actions. An adverse outcome in any one or more of these matters could be material to the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, DuPont may make certain commitments, including representations, warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations, including those related to divested businesses, and DuPont may issue guarantees of third-party obligations. If DuPont is required to make payments as a result, they could exceed the amounts accrued therefor, thereby adversely affecting the Company’s results of operations.\nIf the completed distribution of Corteva or Dow, in each case, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then the Company could be subject to significant tax and indemnification liability.\nThe completed distributions of Corteva and Dow were each conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, the Company’s tax counsel, regarding the qualification of the applicable distribution along with certain related transactions as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code (such opinions, the “DWDP Tax Opinions”). The DWDP Tax Opinions relied on certain facts, assumptions, and undertakings, and certain representations from the Company, Dow and Corteva, as applicable, as well as the IRS Ruling (as defined below). Notwithstanding the DWDP Tax Opinions and the IRS Ruling, the IRS could determine on audit that either, or both, of the distributions and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated, or that the distributions should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the DWDP Tax Opinions.\nEven if a distribution otherwise constituted a tax-free transaction to stockholders under Section 355 of the Code, the Company could be required to recognize corporate level tax on such distribution and certain related transactions under Section 355(e) of the Code if the IRS determines that, as a result of the DWDP Merger or other transactions considered part of a plan with such distribution, there was a 50 percent or greater change in ownership in the Company, Dow or Corteva, as relevant. In connection with the DWDP Merger, the Company sought and received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding the proper time, manner and methodology for measuring common ownership in the stock of the Company, EIDP and TDCC for purposes of determining whether there was a 50 percent or greater change of ownership under Section 355(e) of the Code as a result of the DWDP Merger (the “IRS Ruling”). The DWDP Tax Opinions relied on the continued validity of the IRS Ruling and representations made by the Company as to the common ownership of the stock of TDCC and EIDP immediately prior to the DWDP Merger, and concluded that there was not a 50 percent or greater change of ownership for purposes of Section 355(e) as a result of the DWDP Merger. Notwithstanding the DWDP Tax Opinions and the IRS Ruling, the IRS could determine that a distribution or a related transaction should nevertheless be treated as a taxable transaction to the Company if it determines that any of the Company’s facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings was not correct or that a distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions in the DWDP Tax Opinions that are not covered by the IRS Ruling.\nGenerally, corporate taxes resulting from the failure of a distribution to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be imposed on the Company. Under the DWDP Tax Matters Agreement, Dow and Corteva are generally obligated to indemnify the Company against any such taxes imposed on it. However, if a distribution fails to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes for certain reasons relating to the overall structure of the DWDP Merger and the distributions, then under the DWDP Tax Matters Agreement, the Company and Corteva, on the one hand, and Dow, on the other hand, would share the tax liability resulting from such failure in accordance with the relative equity values of the Company and Dow on the first full trading day following the distribution of Dow, and the Company and Corteva would in turn share any such resulting tax liability in accordance with the relative equity values of the Company and Corteva on the first full trading day following the distribution of Corteva. Furthermore, under the terms of the DWDP Tax Matters Agreement, a party also generally will be responsible for any taxes imposed on the other parties that arise from the failure of either distribution to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or the failure of certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to such party, or such party's affiliates’, stock, assets or business, or any breach of such party's representations made in connection with the IRS Ruling or in any representation letter provided to a tax advisor in connection with certain tax opinions, including the DWDP Tax Opinions, regarding the tax-free status of the distributions and certain related transactions. To the extent that the Company is responsible for any liability under the DWDP Tax Matters Agreement, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nRisks Relating to DuPont’s Business and Results of Operations\nSupply chain and operational disruptions, including those as a result of pandemics and climate change, and volatility in energy and raw material costs, could significantly increase costs and expenses, adversely impact the Company’s sales and earnings and impact access to sources of liquidity.\nThe Company’s manufacturing processes and operations depend on the continued availability of energy and raw materials, the costs of which are subject to worldwide supply and demand as well as other factors beyond the Company’s control, including potential legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating a carbon tax or implementing a cap and trade program which could create increases in costs and price volatility. Operational changes and transition to renewable energy sources to meet country, NGO and corporate-level net-zero GHG emissions pledges and related decarbonization technology investments, may require the Company to make significant capital investments, re-qualify its \nproducts with certain suppliers, as well as meet additional regulatory and compliance requirements and could result in higher cost and expenses. Climate change increases the frequency and severity of potential supply chain and operational disruptions from weather events and natural disasters. The chronic physical impacts associated with climate change, for example, increased temperatures, changes in weather patterns and rising sea levels, could significantly increase costs and expenses and create additional supply chain and operational disruption risks.\nSupply chain disruptions, plant and/or power outages, labor shortages and/or strikes, geo-political activity, weather events and natural disasters, including hurricanes or flooding that impact coastal regions, and global health risks or pandemics could seriously harm the Company’s operations as well as the operations of the Company’s customers and suppliers. In addition, the Company’s suppliers may experience capacity limitations in their own operations or may elect to reduce or eliminate certain product lines. To address this risk, generally, the Company seeks to have many sources of supply for key raw materials in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. In addition, and where the supply market for key raw materials is concentrated, DuPont takes additional steps to manage its exposure to supply chain risk and price fluctuations through, among other things, negotiated long-term contracts some which include minimum purchase obligations. However, there can be no assurance that such mitigation efforts will prevent future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of certain raw materials.\nDuPont also takes actions to offset the effects of higher energy and raw material costs through selling price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction programs. Success in offsetting higher raw material costs with price increases is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market served. As a result, volatility in these costs may negatively impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nDuPont’s manufacturing operations may be adversely affected by impacts of pandemics including government actions and other responsive measures, quarantines and health and availability of essential onsite personnel. DuPont is unable to predict the extent of pandemic related impacts on its business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition which depends on highly uncertain and unpredictable future developments. DuPont’s financial results may be materially and adversely impacted by a variety of factors that have not yet been determined, including potential impairments of goodwill and other assets. DuPont, when necessary, will take actions, including reducing costs, restructuring actions, and delaying certain capital expenditures and non-essential spend. In addition, the Company may consider further reductions in or furloughing additional operations in response to further and/or deeper declines in demand and/or or supply chain disruptions. There can be no guaranty that such actions would significantly mitigate the impact on the company’s business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity or financial condition and the Company may experience materially adverse impacts to its business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as a result of related global economic impacts, including inflationary pressures that have occurred and may continue to occur in the future.\nIn light of the Previously Intended Business Separations and continuing in connection with the Intended Electronics Separation, DuPont has announced it does not expect to complete $500 million in share buyback authority it has under the $1B Share Buyback Program. DuPont may not realize the anticipated benefits of future share repurchase programs and any failure to repurchase the Company’s common stock after DuPont has announced its intention to do so may negatively impact the Company’s stock price.\nUnder future share repurchase programs, DuPont may make share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open share market purchases or privately negotiated transactions off market, including additional ASR agreements in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The timing and amount of any repurchases, if any, will depend on factors such as the stock price, economic and market conditions, and corporate and regulatory requirements. Any failure to repurchase shares after the Company has announced its intention to do so may negatively impact DuPont’s reputation, investor confidence and the price of the Company’s common stock.\nThe existence of share repurchase programs could cause the price of the Company’s common stock to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for DuPont stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of DuPont common stock may decline below the levels at which DuPont repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the programs.\nRepurchasing common stock will reduce the amount of cash DuPont has available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities and other general corporate requirements, and the Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these share repurchase programs.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by interruption or regulation of the Company’s information technology or network systems and storage of information and other business disruptions.\nDuPont relies on centralized and local information technology and physical networks and systems, some of which are managed or accessible by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to otherwise manage or support its business. Additionally, the Company collects, stores, processes, uses and has access to certain data, including proprietary business and personal information or data that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, orders and controls or rules imposed by customer or other contracts. The processing and storage of personal information is increasingly subject to privacy and data security regulations, and many such regulations are country or territory-specific. The interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, Asia Pacific, Latin America and elsewhere are continuing to evolve and may be different across these jurisdictions. The Company seeks to implement these requirements in a compliant manner. Violations of these laws or standards could result in criminal or civil sanctions, investigations, or enforcement actions. Even the mere allegation of such violations, could harm the Company’s ability to do business, its results of operations, financial position and reputation.\nInformation technology system and/or network disruptions, whether caused by acts of sabotage, employee error, malfeasance or other actions, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations as well as the operations of the Company’s customers and suppliers. Other business disruptions may also be caused by security breaches, which could include, for example, attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers, viruses, breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other actions or other disruptions. DuPont and/or the Company’s suppliers may fail to effectively prevent, detect and recover from these or other security breaches and, therefore, such breaches could result in misuse of the Company’s assets, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential or personal information, some of which is subject to privacy and security laws, and other business disruptions. As a result, DuPont may be subject to legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales, interference with regulatory compliance which could result in sanctions or penalties, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in the Company’s operations, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLike other major corporations, DuPont is the target of cyber-attacks, from time to time, which include phishing, spam emails, hacking, social engineering, industrial espionage and malicious software. DuPont has determined that these attacks have resulted, and could result in the future, in unauthorized parties gaining access to certain confidential business information. However, risks from previous cybersecurity incidents, have not materially affected the Company, including its strategy, results of operations or financial condition. Although, there can be no assurance that DuPont will not suffer such losses in the future.\nDuPont has engaged and expects to continue to engage in merger and acquisition activity. As part of preparatory and post-closing integration activities, the Company: (i) conducts a cybersecurity risk threat assessment and when evidence of a breach is uncovered, conducts additional due diligence; (ii) based on the assessment, the Company develops and implements risk mitigation plans if needed and brings the acquisition under the Company’s cyber-attack/breach detection and response programs; and (iii) conducts an internal controls risk and compliance assessment and creates, as needed, responsive action plans intended to mitigate and remediate identified weaknesses in the control environment.\nDuPont seeks to actively manage the risks within the Company’s control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, DuPont may be required to expend significant resources to enhance the Company’s control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEnforcing the Company’s intellectual property rights, or defending against intellectual property claims asserted by others, could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, know-how and confidential information, trademarks, tradenames and trade dress, are important to the Company’s business. DuPont endeavors to protect the Company’s business, products and processes by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights under the intellectual property laws of certain jurisdictions around the world. However, DuPont may be unable to obtain or enforce its intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions for various reasons including government policies and regulations, and changes in such policies and regulations, including changes made in reaction to pressure from non-governmental organizations, or the public generally, which could impact the extent of intellectual property protection afforded by such jurisdictions.\nDuPont has designed and implemented internal controls intended to restrict access to and unauthorized use of the Company’s confidential information and trade secrets. Despite these precautions, the Company’s confidential information and trade secrets are vulnerable to unauthorized access and use through employee error or actions, theft by employees or third parties, \ncybersecurity incidents and other security breaches. When unauthorized access and use is discovered, DuPont considers the matter for report to governmental authorities for investigation, as appropriate, and takes measures intended to stop and contain unauthorized access and to mitigate any potential impact which may include civil actions seeking redress, and/or damages based on loss to the Company and/or unjust enrichment.\nThird parties may also claim the Company’s products violate their intellectual property rights. Defending such claims, even those without merit, is time-consuming and expensive. In addition, as a result of such claims, DuPont has and could be required in the future to enter into license agreements, develop non-infringing products or engage in litigation that could be costly. If challenges are resolved adversely, it could negatively impact the Company’s ability to obtain licenses on competitive terms, commercialize new products and generate sales from existing products.\nAny one or more of the above factors could significantly affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the Company’s financial results.\nIn connection with completed acquisitions, DuPont has recorded goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. As a result of the DWDP Merger and related acquisition method of accounting, EIDP’s assets and liabilities were remeasured and DowDuPont recognized them at fair value. Since certain of the Company's assets at December 31, 2024 are heritage EIDP or were subsequently acquired, declines, if any, in projected cash flows could have a material, negative impact on the fair value of the Company’s reporting units and assets. Refer to Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding future impairment risk for the Protection reporting unit.\nIn accordance with US GAAP, at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are identified, DuPont must assess both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. In addition, in connection with the 2025 Segment Realignment, the Company will realign its operating and reportable segments which is expected to change the composition of reporting units. The associated reporting units' goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will be assessed for impairment before and after the 2025 Segment realignment which could result in future impairments. Intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. If testing indicates that goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, their carrying values will be written down based on fair values with a charge against earnings. Where DuPont utilizes discounted cash flow methodologies in determining fair values, significant negative industry or economic trends and forecasts (including projected revenue growth, EBITDA, capital expenditures, weighted average cost of capital, terminal growth rates, and the tax rates), disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant change or planned changes in use of our assets, changes in the structure of the Company's business, divestitures, market capitalization declines or increases in associated discount rates may impair our goodwill and other intangible assets. When DuPont utilizes the market approach in determining fair values, adverse changes in projected EBITDA and derived multiples from comparable market transactions may impair our goodwill. Accordingly, any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations.\nFailure to effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances and other portfolio actions could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDuPont has stated that it will actively manage its portfolio and continually evaluate opportunities to optimize its mix of businesses to align with its growth objectives. At times, DuPont may engage in M&A activities including reviewing acquisition opportunities, responding to incoming inquiries, and evaluating strategic alternatives for its businesses. These activities may or may not result in a transaction. If DuPont is unable to successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses, DuPont could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, including any expected increases in revenues and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results. DuPont expects to continually review the Company’s portfolio of assets for contributions to the Company’s objectives and alignment with the Company’s growth strategy. The Letter Agreement between the Company and Corteva limits DuPont’s ability to separate certain businesses and assets to third parties without assigning certain of its indemnification obligations under the DWDP Separation and Distribution Agreement to the transferee of such businesses and assets or meeting certain other alternative conditions. DuPont may be unable to meet the conditions under the Letter Agreement, if applicable. Even if the conditions under the Letter Agreement are met or are not applicable, DuPont may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets, and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect the Company’s earnings. Moreover, DuPont might incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce the Company’s earnings. In addition, if the execution or implementation of acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful and/or the Company fails to effectively manage its cost as its portfolio evolves, it could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFailure to maintain a streamlined operating model and sustain operational improvements may reduce the Company’s profitability or adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company’s profitability and margin growth will depend in part on the Company’s ability to maintain a streamlined operating model and drive sustainable improvements, through actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. A variety of factors may adversely affect the Company’s ability to realize the targeted cost synergies, including failure to successfully optimize the Company’s facilities footprint, the failure to take advantage of the Company’s global supply chain, the failure to identify and eliminate duplicative programs. There can be no assurance that DuPont will be able to achieve or sustain any or all of the cost savings generated from restructuring actions.\nThe Company’s results will be affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\nDemand for the Company’s products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, will be affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company’s response to downward pricing trends to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer preferences, order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes and other factors outside of the Company's control; (iv) availability and cost of raw materials and energy, as well as the Company’s ability and success in passing through increases in such costs; (v) levels of economic growth in the geographic and end use markets served by the Company; (vi) changes in buying patterns thought to be temporary destocking could be indicative of loss of market share and (vii) the mega-trends in digital transformation, connectivity, automation and ethics, environmental impact and sustainability driven purchasing decisions. \nThe demand for product offerings that align with sustainability goals is expected to continue to increase. Customers are seeking products that are made using environmentally sound practices and materials, and which adhere to ethical and human rights standards. Demand for product offerings that are less carbon-intensive or customers determine support their respective sustainability goals (in areas such as Substances of Concern, Circular Economy, Waste, Water, nature/biodiversity, Responsible Procurement, Human Rights) is expected to continue to increase, driven by end-user and customer demand, investor preference, and government legislative and market- and product-specific actions in response to risks created by climate change. Failure to timely react to these trends and manage the Company’s product portfolio and innovation activities responsively could decrease the competitiveness of the Company’s products and result in the de-selection of the Company as a partner of choice. In addition, the failure to set goals, take actions, make progress and report against, commensurate with relevant market competitors, the Company’s sustainability strategy, could harm the Company’s reputation, and its ability to compete and to attract top talent, and could result in increased investor activism and the deselection of the Company as a partner or supplier of choice.\nSuccess in achieving the Company’s growth objectives is significantly dependent on the timing and market acceptance of the Company’s new product offerings, including the Company’s ability to renew the Company’s pipeline of new product offerings and to bring those offerings to market. This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. \nThe Company invests resources in technology and its operational assets to satisfy anticipated demand. There is no guarantee that demand will support the Company’s new investments.\nThere are no guarantees that new product offerings will prove to be commercially successful. Additionally, the Company’s expansion into new markets may result in greater-than-expected risks, liabilities and expenses.\nFailure to attract and retain talented people with the necessary knowledge and experience could adversely affect Company’s ability to compete and achieve its strategic goals.\nAttracting, developing, and retaining talented employees is essential to the Company’s successful delivery of products and services, ability to innovate, including developing new products and technologies, and ability to identify trends and develop new markets.\nCompetition for employees can be intense. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate, motivate and reward its employees, it may not be able to retain them or attract new employee in the future which could adversely impact the Company’s ability to compete effectively. The Company may be required to increase salary and/or benefits to attract top performers which could significantly increase the Company's costs and adversely impact its results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Capital Resources and Liquidity\nChanges in the Company’s credit ratings could increase the Company’s cost of borrowing or restrict the Company’s ability to access debt capital markets. The Company’s credit ratings are important to the Company’s cost of capital.\nDuPont relies on access to the debt capital markets and other short-term borrowings to finance the Company’s long-term and day-to-day operations. A decrease in the ratings assigned to it by the ratings agencies may negatively impact the Company’s access to the debt capital markets and increase the Company’s cost of borrowing. The major rating agencies will routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to it. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include weighing the Company’s financial strength versus business, industry and financial risk. The addition of further leverage to the Company’s capital structure could impact the Company’s credit ratings. Failure to maintain an investment grade rating at the Company’s current level would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and the Company’s results of operations and could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and access to the capital markets. Any limitation on the Company’s ability to continue to raise money in the debt capital markets could have a substantial negative effect on the Company’s liquidity. If DuPont is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, it could restrict the Company’s current operations, activities under its current and future share buyback programs, and the Company’s growth opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.\nA significant percentage of the Company’s net sales are generated from the Company’s international operations and are subject to economic, geo-political, foreign exchange and other risks.\nDuPont does business globally in about 50 countries. The percentage of net sales generated by the international operations of DuPont, including U.S. exports, was approximately 67 percent of net sales on a continuing operations basis for the year ended December 31, 2024. With Asia Pacific as the Company’s largest region by revenue and China as the largest country within the Asia Pacific region and second largest globally by revenue, DuPont expects the percentage of the Company’s net sales derived from international operations to continue to be significant. Risks related to international operations include:\n•exchange control regulations\n•fluctuations in foreign exchange rates\n•foreign investment laws\n•GDP growth rate, especially in the U.S. and China\nThe Company’s international operations expose it to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. As of the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s largest currency exposures are the European euro, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, South Korean won and Canadian dollar. U.S. dollar fluctuations against foreign currency have an impact to commercial prices and raw material costs in some cases and could result in local price increases if the price or raw material costs is denominated in U.S. dollar.\nSales and expenses of the Company’s non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and fluctuations of foreign currency against the U.S. dollar could impact U.S. dollar-denominated earnings. In addition, the Company’s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can also be impacted by foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, which could result in exchange gain or loss from revaluation.\nDuPont also faces exchange rate risk from the Company’s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries.\nDuPont has a balance sheet hedging program and actively looks for opportunities in managing currency exposures related to earnings. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to it or be successful in completely mitigating such exposures.\nDuPont generates significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While DuPont employs comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure the Company’s ability to fund the Company’s operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom DuPont transacts business could expose it to financial loss.\nAny one or more of the above factors could adversely affect the Company’s international operations and could significantly affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Changes and Compliance\nRisks related to trade disputes, regulations and policies could adversely impact DuPont’s results of operations.\nTrade regulations, policies and disputes can and have increased tariffs, trade barriers, limited the Company’s ability to sell certain products to certain customers, and otherwise impacted the Company’s global supply and distribution chains and \nresearch and development activities. Continuing or expanding trade restrictions or disputes or changes in international trade policy, including new or increased tariffs or export controls, could adversely impact demand for and manufacture, distribution or sale of the Company’s products, and restrict access to certain markets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and growth prospects. China’s policy to enhance domestic supply in sectors where the Company competes, could impact future demand for the Company’s products.\nThe costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations and substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.\nDuPont continues to be subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment, product content, greenhouse gas emissions, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, which include certain substances of concern, and waste materials. Increasing sustainability reporting, supply chain due diligence and regulatory registrations may incur further costs. Costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements. Moreover, changes in the regulatory environment could inhibit or interrupt the Company’s operations, require modifications to the Company’s products, processes or facilities or cause the Company to discontinue or relocate the production of certain products. Changes to regulations or the implementation of additional regulations, may result in significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced margins or profitability.\nAccordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities causing a negative impact on the Company’s business, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected by industry-specific risks including process safety and product stewardship/regulatory compliance issues.\nDuPont is subject to risks which include, but are not limited to, product safety or quality; shifting consumer preferences and public perception; federal, state, and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; packaging, environmental, health and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims. \nIn most jurisdictions, DuPont must test the safety, efficacy and environmental impact of the Company’s products to satisfy regulatory requirements and obtain the needed approvals. In certain jurisdictions, DuPont must periodically renew the Company’s approvals, which may require it to demonstrate compliance with then-current standards. The regulatory approvals process is lengthy, complex and in some markets unpredictable, with requirements that can vary by product, technology, industry and country. Regulatory standards and trial procedures are continuously changing in response to technological developments, changes in legislation, and governmental, NGO and societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection. The pace of change together with the lack of regulatory harmony could result in unintended noncompliance. To maintain the Company’s right to produce or sell existing products or to commercialize new products, DuPont must be able to demonstrate the Company’s ability to satisfy the requirements of regulatory agencies, industries, and customers.\nThe failure to meet existing and new requirements or receive necessary permits or approvals could have near- and long-term effects on the Company’s ability to produce and sell certain current and future products, which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, negative publicity related to product liability, safety, health and environmental matters may damage the Company’s reputation. \nChanges in the global and local tax regulatory environments in, and the distribution of income among, the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, could adversely impact DuPont’s results of operations. \nDuPont's future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of the Company’s tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. The Company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities. The impact, if any, of these audits to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits is not estimable. The Company’s tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of the Company’s deferred tax assets. \nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was enacted into law in the United States. Among other changes to the Code, the IRA imposes a 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax on certain corporations (the “CAMT”). Changes in tax laws or regulations, including further regulatory developments in connection with the IRA; multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) including the OECD's Global Anti-Base Erosion (\"GloBE\") rules under Pillar Two, which introduces a global minimum corporate tax rate set at 15 percent on multinational enterprises; and the OECD’s, European Commission’s and other major jurisdiction’s heightened interest in and taxation of large multi-national companies, increase tax uncertainty and could impact the Company’s effective tax rate and provision for income taxes. Given the unpredictability of possible further changes to and the potential interdependency of the United States or foreign tax laws and regulations, it is difficult to predict the cumulative effect of such tax laws and regulations on DuPont’s results of operations.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and reputation could be harmed by improper conduct by its employees, agents or business partners. \nDuPont is required to comply with numerous U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations including those related to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, anti-trust, anti-money laundering laws, anti-slavery and human rights. The Company’s policies mandate compliance with these laws and regulations. The Company operates globally, including in parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and where local customs and practices can be inconsistent with anti-corruption and/or anti-bribery laws. Despite the Company’s training and compliance program, DuPont cannot ensure that its internal control processes will prevent improper action by employees, agents, distributors, suppliers or business partners. Violations of these laws could result in criminal or civil sanctions and even the mere allegation of such violations, could harm the Company’s ability to do business, its results of operations, financial position and reputation.",
