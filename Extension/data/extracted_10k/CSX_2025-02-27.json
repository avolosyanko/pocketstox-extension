      "text": "Item 1.  Business\nCSX Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's leading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations. CSX and the rail industry provide customers with access to an expansive and interconnected transportation network that plays a key role in North American commerce and is critical to the long-term economic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. In addition, freight railroads provide the most economical and environmentally efficient means to transport goods over land. \nCSX Transportation, Inc.\nCSX’s principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain through its approximately 20,000 route-mile rail network and serves major population centers in 26 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It has access to over 70 ocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. This access allows the Company to meet the dynamic transportation needs of manufacturers, industrial producers, the automotive industry, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers, and energy producers. The Company’s intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. CSXT also serves thousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections with other Class I railroads and more than 240 short-line and regional railroads. On June 1, 2022, CSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. (“Pan Am”), which is the parent company of Pan Am Railways, Inc. This acquisition expanded CSXT’s reach in the Northeastern United States. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations.\nCSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities. Substantially all of these activities are focused on supporting railroad operations.\nOther Entities\nIn addition to CSXT, the Company’s subsidiaries include Quality Carriers, Inc. (\"Quality Carriers\"), CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. (“CSX Intermodal Terminals”), Total Distribution Services, Inc. (“TDSI”), TRANSFLO Terminal Services, Inc. (“TRANSFLO”), CSX Technology, Inc. (“CSX Technology”) and other subsidiaries. Quality Carriers is the largest provider of bulk liquid chemicals truck transportation in North America. CSX Intermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals, predominantly in the eastern United States, and also provides drayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments) for certain customers. TDSI serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations. TRANSFLO connects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products from rail to trucks. The biggest TRANSFLO markets are chemicals and agriculture, which includes shipments of plastics and ethanol. CSX Technology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company.\nOperating Model\nThe Company is focused on developing and strictly maintaining a scheduled service plan with an emphasis on improving customer service, optimizing assets and increasing employee engagement. When this operating model is executed effectively, the Company competes for an increased share of the U.S. freight market. Further, this model leads to reduced costs and strong free cash flow generation. \nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.3\n\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\n\nLines of Business\nDuring 2024, the Company's services generated $14.5 billion of revenue and served four primary lines of business: merchandise, intermodal, coal and trucking.\n•The merchandise business shipped 2.6 million carloads (42% of volume) and generated $8.9 billion in revenue (61% of revenue) in 2024. The Company’s merchandise business is comprised of shipments in the following diverse markets: chemicals, agricultural and food products, automotive, minerals, forest products, metals and equipment, and fertilizers.\n•The intermodal business shipped 2.9 million units (46% of volume) and generated $2.0 billion in revenue (14% of revenue) in 2024. The intermodal business combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the flexibility of trucks and offers a cost and environmental advantage over long-haul trucking. Through a network of approximately 30 terminals, the intermodal business serves all major markets east of the Mississippi River and transports mainly manufactured consumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments.\n•The coal business shipped 736 thousand carloads (12% of volume) and generated $2.2 billion in revenue (15% of revenue) in 2024. The Company transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers and industrial plants as well as export coal to deep-water port facilities. Most of the export coal the Company transports is used for steelmaking, while the majority of domestic coal the Company ships is used for electricity generation.\n•The trucking business generated $844 million, or 6%, of revenue in 2024. Trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of Quality Carriers.\nOther revenue accounted for 4% of the Company’s total revenue in 2024. This category includes revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and incidental charges, including intermodal storage and equipment usage, demurrage and switching. Revenue from regional subsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents charges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad. \nCSX's Committed Workforce\nMost of the Company’s employees provide or support transportation services. The Company had more than 23,500 employees as of December 2024, which includes approximately 17,500 employees that are members of a rail labor union. There are 12 rail unions at CSX that participate in national bargaining. As of December 2, 2022, all of these rail unions were covered by national agreements with the Class I railroads and CSX-specific agreements that remained in effect through December 31, 2024. Collective agreements under the Railway Labor Act do not expire, but continue until amended. Prior to the 2022 agreements becoming amendable, CSX worked with several major rail unions on new five-year labor agreements. As of the date of this filing, new labor agreements have been fully ratified by seven unions representing approximately 40% of the Company's unionized workforce.\nCSX prioritizes workplace safety for employees and is committed to continued improvement through enhanced processes, training, technology, communication, and continuous collaboration with customers and peers across the railroad industry. Training programs and processes are focused on injury and accident prevention as well as emergency preparedness. Additionally, the attainment of key safety targets is a component of management's annual incentive program. The FRA Personal Injury Frequency Index, a measure of the number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours, was 1.19 in 2024 and 0.94 in 2023.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.4\n\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\n\nThe Compensation and Talent Management Committee of the Board of Directors is charged with oversight of CSX's workforce. The Company is committed to developing a culture that promotes workforce diversity and inclusion and encourages ethical behavior. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 22% of CSX's overall workforce and 35% of management was diverse, calculated as the percentage of males of color and all females. In 2024, CSX was recognized as a “Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion” by Disability:IN and the American Association of People with Disabilities for a sixth consecutive year after receiving a top score on their disability equality index. The CSX Code of Ethics serves as a guiding standard for ethical behavior and covers many types of matters, including discrimination and harassment as well as safety. Annually, all management employees are required, and union employees are highly encouraged, to complete ethics training.\nCompany History\nA leader in freight rail transportation for nearly 200 years, the Company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century when The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (“B&O”), the nation’s first common carrier, was chartered in 1827. Since that time, the Company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-increasing demands of a growing nation. Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&O through merger and consolidation to create what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought new geographical reach to valuable markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors.\nCSX Corporation was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries into CSX. The merger allowed the Company to connect northern population centers and Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. Later, the Company’s acquisition of key portions of Conrail, Inc. (\"Conrail\") allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the Southeast already served by CSXT. This current rail network, which now includes the network acquired from Pan Am, allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with safe, dependable, environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service.\nCompetition\nThe business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation providers that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and reliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads, motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. \nCSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and deregulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels. For further discussion on the risk of competition to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.5\n\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\n\nRegulatory Environment\nThe Company's operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial (Canada) and local laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses operating in the United States and Canada. In the U.S., the railroad operations conducted by the Company's subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over railroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars, locomotives and hazardous materials requirements. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the Company's properties and operations. \nThe Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), a component of the Department of Homeland Security, has broad authority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications. In Canada, the railroad operations conducted by the Company’s subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency.\nAlthough the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated the U.S. rail industry, the STB has broad jurisdiction over rail carriers. The STB regulates routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, rates for non-exempt traffic, acquisitions of control over rail common carriers and the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, among other railroad activities. Any new rules from the STB regarding, among other things, competitive access or revenue adequacy could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining vital infrastructure. For further discussion on regulatory risks to the Company, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFinancial Information\nInformation regarding the Company's results of operations and financial position can be found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther Information\nCSX makes available on its website www.csx.com, free of charge, its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The information on the CSX website is not part of this annual report on Form 10-K. Additionally, the Company has posted its code of ethics on its website, which is also available to any shareholder who requests it. This Form 10-K and other SEC filings made by CSX are also accessible through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\n\nCSX has included the certifications of its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“the Act”) as Exhibit 31, as well as Section 906 of the Act as Exhibit 32 to this Form 10-K report.\n\nFor additional information concerning business conducted by the Company during 2024, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.6\n\n\nCSX CORPORATION\n",

      "text": "Item 1A.  Risk Factors\nThe risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Company's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently does not deem to be material also may materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nRegulatory, Legislative and Legal\nNew legislation, regulatory changes or other governmental actions could impact the Company's earnings or restrict its ability to independently negotiate prices.\nLegislation passed by Congress or state or local assemblies; new regulations issued by federal, state or local agencies; executive orders issued by the President of the United States or governors; or other governmental actions could significantly affect the revenues, costs (including income taxes), and profitability of the Company's business. In addition, statutes, regulations, orders or other governmental actions that, among other things, impose price constraints, restrict access to government funding, or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect the Company's profitability.\n\nGovernment regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.\nThe Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA and other state, provincial, local and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax, legal, cybersecurity and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs, adversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory sanctions. \nCSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials and could be adversely impacted by non-compliance with applicable regulations or from regulatory and legislative changes.\nCSXT is required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials and has a legal obligation to transport certain hazardous materials under the common carrier mandate. Applicable rules issued by the TSA place significant security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of hazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous substances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the transport of hazardous materials.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.7\n\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\n\nThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.\nAs part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes over commercial practices, labor and unemployment matters, occupational and personal injury claims, property damage or freight damage, environmental and other matters. The Company may experience material judgments or incur significant costs to defend existing and future lawsuits. Although the Company maintains insurance to cover some of these types of claims and establishes reserves when appropriate, final amounts determined to be due on any outstanding matters may exceed the Company's insurance coverage or differ materially from the recorded reserves. Additionally, the Company could be impacted by adverse developments not currently reflected in the Company's reserve estimates.\nOperational, Safety and Business Disruption\nAn epidemic or pandemic and the initiatives to reduce its transmission could adversely affect the Company's business.\nThe Company has been and could in the future be materially and adversely affected by a public health crisis, including a widespread epidemic or pandemic. During a health crisis, policies and initiatives may be instituted by the public and private sector to reduce transmission, such as closures of businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions. These policies or initiatives could adversely affect demand for the commodities and products that the Company transports, including import and export volume. \nIn addition, initiatives to reduce transmission could result in supply chain disruptions, which could impact volumes and make it more difficult for the Company to serve its customers. Moreover, operations are negatively affected when a significant number of employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. To the extent a public health crisis adversely affects the Company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nThe Company relies on the security, stability and availability of its technology systems to operate its business.\nThe Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business. The security, stability and availability of the Company’s and its key third-party vendors’ information technology systems are critical to its ability to operate safely and effectively and to compete within the transportation industry. A successful data breach, cyber-attack, or the occurrence of any similar incident that impacts the Company’s or its key third-party vendors’ information technology systems could result in a service interruption, train accident, misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), process failure, or other operational difficulties. A disruption or compromise of the Company’s or its key third-party vendors' information technology systems, even for short periods of time, and any resulting theft or compromise of Company confidential or proprietary information (including personal information), could adversely affect the Company’s business or reputation, create significant legal, regulatory or financial exposure and have a material adverse impact on CSX’s business, financial condition or operations.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.8\n\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\n\nThe Company, its third-party vendors and other companies in the rail and transportation industries have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, data breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents. These incidents may include, among other things, malware, ransomware, distributed denial of service attacks, social engineering, phishing, theft, malfeasance or improper access by employees or third-party vendors, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, human error, fraud, or other modes of attack or disruption. Attacks of these nature are increasing in frequency, levels of persistence, intensity and sophistication, including by nation-state threat actors or those associated with nation-states. Further, the Company may be at increased risk of experiencing a cyber-attack as a result of being a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure. If such an event takes place, the Company may be required to incur significant expenses in excess of existing cybersecurity insurance coverage. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities, data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents. The Company or its third-party vendors may also experience cybersecurity incidents as a result of employees, third-party vendors and other third parties with which they interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments.\nDespite the Company’s efforts to protect its information technology systems, it may not be able to prevent or anticipate all data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents, detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner or adequately remediate any such incident. Due to applicable laws, rules and regulations or contractual obligations, CSX may be held responsible for data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents attributed to its third-party vendors as they relate to the information CSX shares with them.\nAdditionally, if CSX is unable to successfully acquire, develop, implement, or update new or existing technology, including artificial intelligence, it may suffer adverse financial impacts or a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation services.\nNetwork or supply chain constraints could have a negative impact on service, operating efficiency or volume of shipments.\nCSXT has experienced, and in the future could experience, rail network difficulties related to: (i) locomotive or crew shortages; (ii) labor shortages or other service disruptions in the supply chain affecting trucking, ports, handling facilities, customer facilities or other railroads; (iii) unpredictable increases in demand; (iv) extreme weather conditions; (v) regulatory changes resulting in forced access or impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport freight or maintain routes; (vi) reductions in availability of pooled equipment, including chassis; (vii) impacts from changes in network capacity or structure; or (viii) increased passenger activities, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and overall efficiency.\nCSXT, as a common carrier by rail, transports hazardous materials, which could expose the Company to significant costs and claims in the event of a train accident.\nA train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant costs and claims arising from personal injury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Under federal regulations, CSXT is required to transport certain hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.9\n\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\n\nFuture acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in the Company's operations.\nTerrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. CSXT's rail lines, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror or war. This risk could cause significant business interruption and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. In addition, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company could increase dramatically, or the coverage may no longer be available.\nFederal, state and local governmental bodies have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry. For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement additional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.\nSevere weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in excess of available insurance coverage.\nThe Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, hurricanes, fires and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of locomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Hurricanes as well as storm and flooding events have impacted the Company's network in the past, leading to interrupted service and damage to track structure and equipment. Changes in weather patterns are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions. \nInsurance maintained by the Company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's damages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore service without a significant interruption to operations.\nCompetitive, Economic and Financial\nThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers.\nThe Company experiences competition in pricing, service, reliability and other factors from various transportation providers including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines. Other transportation providers generally use public rights-of-way that are built and maintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal resources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent size or weight restrictions on trucks, could negatively impact the Company's competitive position. Additionally, any future consolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company operates.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.10\n\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\n\nGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.\nA decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and products the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on the Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European economies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export coal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, embargoes or changes to trade agreements or policies, such as tariffs, could result in reduced import and export volumes. If the Company experiences significant declines in demand for its transportation services with respect to one or more commodities and products or continues to experience the impacts of inflation, the Company may experience reduced revenue and increased operating costs, workforce adjustments, and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nChanging dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets could negatively impact profitability.\nOver time, changing dynamics in the U.S. and global energy markets, including the impacts of regulation and alternative fuel sources, have resulted in lower energy production from coal-fired power plants in CSX's service territory. Changes in natural gas prices, or other factors impacting demand for electricity, could impact future power generation at coal-fired plants, which would affect the Company's coal volumes and revenues. \nWeaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.\nThe Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and bank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, significant increases in interest rates, or the deterioration of the Company’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing costs. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.\nAvailability of Critical Supplies and Labor\nThe unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet demand.\nMarketplace conditions for resources like locomotives and the availability of qualified personnel, including engineers and conductors as well as other skilled professional or technical employees, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the Company strives to maintain adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period. \nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.11\n\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\n\nDisruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.\nThe capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, freight cars and locomotives) limits the number of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in global demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.\nFailure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages. \nMost of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the union. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work stoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an intervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are exhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could strike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. \nClimate and Environmental\nThe Company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate or weather-related risks as well as regulatory and legislative responses.\nThere is potential for operational impacts from climate-related risks, including changing weather patterns, in the Company's operational territory, which could impact the Company's network or other assets. \nClimate and emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the federal, state, provincial and local levels. These final and proposed laws and regulations take the form of restrictions, caps, taxes or other controls on emissions as well as requirements to disclose climate-related information. In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting emission reductions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary and mobile sources. Any of these pending or proposed laws or regulations, could adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to mandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada; (iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv) making it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner. Any of these factors could reduce the amount of shipments the Company handles and have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, CSX may become subject to legal requirements to disclose climate-related information and may become subject to demands or expectations by its supply chain partners, customers or other stakeholders to disclose information relating to climate risk or set related targets or goals. The Company's current practices with respect to climate risk disclosure may fail to meet these developing legal requirements or stakeholder demands or expectations. In addition, legislative or regulatory uncertainties and change regarding climate-related risks, including inconsistent perspectives or requirements, are likely to result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit, reputational and other risks and costs.\nCSX 2024 Form 10-K p.12\n\n\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART I\n\nThe Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that may result in significant costs.\nThe Company is subject to wide-ranging federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions into the air, ground and water; the handling, storage, use, generation, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials; the clean-up of hazardous material and petroleum releases and the health and safety of our employees. If the Company violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, CSX could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. The Company can also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to any hazardous or otherwise harmful substances that CSX is transporting or storing. In certain circumstances, environmental liability can extend to formerly owned or operated properties, leased properties, adjacent properties and properties owned by third parties or Company predecessors, as well as to properties currently owned, leased or used by the Company.\nThe Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to allegations or findings to the effect that it has violated, or is strictly liable under, environmental laws or regulations, and such violations can result in the Company's incurring fines, penalties or costs relating to the cleanup of environmental contamination. Although the Company believes it has appropriately recorded current and long-term liabilities for known and reasonably estimable future environmental costs, it could incur significant costs that exceed reserves or require unanticipated cash expenditures as a result of any of the foregoing. The Company also may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown or future environmental contamination.",
