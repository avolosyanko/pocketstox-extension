      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nDUKE ENERGYGeneral\nDuke Energy was incorporated on May 3, 2005, and is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the FERC and other regulatory agencies listed below. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are also Subsidiary Registrants, including Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. Operations in Kentucky are conducted through Duke Energy Ohio's wholly owned subsidiary, Duke Energy Kentucky. References herein to Duke Energy Ohio include Duke Energy Ohio and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise noted. When discussing Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its separate Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants electronically file reports with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to such reports.\nThe SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at sec.gov. Additionally, information about the Duke Energy Registrants, including reports filed with the SEC, is available through Duke Energy’s website at duke-energy.com. Such reports are accessible at no charge and are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nBusiness Segments\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes two reportable business segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure (EU&I) and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure (GU&I). The remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other. Commercial Renewables is reported as discontinued operations and is no longer a reportable segment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Dispositions,\" for further details. Duke Energy's chief operating decision-maker routinely reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the business. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Business Segments.” The following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energy’s business segments, as well as Other.\nELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nEU&I conducts operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio. EU&I provides retail electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 8.6 million customers within the Southeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. The service territory is approximately 90,000 square miles across six states with a total estimated population of 27 million. The operations include electricity sold wholesale to municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load-serving entities. \nDuring 2021, Duke Energy executed an agreement providing for an investment by an affiliate of GIC in Duke Energy Indiana in exchange for a 19.9% minority interest issued by Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC, the holding company for Duke Energy Indiana. The transaction was completed following two closings. Additionally, in November 2022, Duke Energy committed to a plan to sell the Commercial Renewables business segment, excluding the offshore wind contract for Carolina Long Bay, which was moved to EU&I. Duke Energy entered into purchase and sale agreements with affiliates of Brookfield for the sale of the utility-scale solar and wind group in June 2023 and with affiliates of ArcLight for the distributed generation group in July 2023. Both transactions closed in October 2023 and the sale of the remaining assets was concluded in January 2025. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Dispositions,\" for additional information. \nDuke Energy owns a 50% interest in DATC. DATC owns 100% interest in DATC Path 15 Transmission LLC, which owns transmission rights in North America. In January 2025, Duke Energy entered into an agreement to sell its indirect 50% ownership interest in DATC Path 15 Transmission LLC. In November 2024, Duke Energy sold its 50% ownership interest in Pioneer. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates” for further information.\nThe following map shows the service territory for EU&I as of December 31, 2024.\n9\n\n\n\nBUSINESS    \n![alt  euimap2018001a02.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326160/000132616025000072/duk-20241231_g2.jpg)\nThe electric operations and investments in projects are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, the NRC, the NCUC, the PSCSC, the FPSC, the IURC, the PUCO and the KPSC.\nThe following table represents the distribution of GWh billed sales by customer class for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n                                            Duke                    Duke                    Duke                    Duke                    Duke\n                                          Energy                  Energy                  Energy                  Energy                  Energy\n                                       Carolinas                Progress                 Florida                    Ohio                 Indiana\nResidential                             33     %                 27    %                 50    %                 37    %                 29    %\nCommercial                              33     %                 22    %                 36    %                 39    %                 26    %\nIndustrial                              22     %                 14    %                  7    %                 22    %                 30    %\nTotal retail sales                      88     %                 63    %                 93    %                 98    %                 85    %\nWholesale and other sales               12     %                 37    %                  7    %                  2    %                 15    %\nTotal sales                            100     %                100    %                100    %                100    %                100    %\nThe number of retail customers within the EU&I service territory is expected to increase over time. Weather-normal sales volumes have shown growth in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to strong residential customer growth and strength in the commercial sector including data center usage. Industrial sales remained soft due to overall weakness across the class, including some manufacturing plant closings in certain jurisdictions, impacts of continued high interest rates, and difficulty hiring qualified labor. The impact on customers' usage of electricity from these factors and other potential economic dynamics continues to be monitored. Over a longer time frame, it is expected that the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliances will have a negative impact on average usage per residential customer; however, decoupled rates in North Carolina and various rate design mechanisms in other jurisdictions partially mitigate the impact of the declining usage per customer on overall profitability. Commercial and industrial sales volumes are expected to grow over this longer time frame as sales benefit from a robust economic development portfolio.\nSeasonality and the Impact of Weather\nRevenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, which results in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Residential and commercial customers are typically more impacted by weather than industrial customers, although decoupling mechanisms in certain jurisdictions may mitigate some of the weather impacts. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions.\n\nBUSINESS    \nThe estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variances from a normal condition and customers’ historic usage patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods. Estimates of weather impacts may be more difficult to determine during periods of extreme or more volatile weather. An unusually active hurricane season that impacted the Florida and Carolinas territories was also considered when quantifying the impacts of weather for 2024. Declines in usage caused by outage durations related to hurricanes Helene and Milton were estimated and included as an impact due to weather.\nHeating degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling degree day.\nCompetition\nRetail\nEU&I’s businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market for generation service. EU&I owns and operates facilities necessary to generate, transmit, distribute and sell electricity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices. \nIn Ohio, EU&I conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers. EU&I earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity, but not on the cost of the underlying energy.\nCompetition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources including on-site generation from industrial customers and distributed generation, such as private solar, at residential, commercial and/or industrial customer sites.\nWholesale\nDuke Energy competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives and wholesale transactions under primarily cost-based contracts approved by FERC. The principal factors in competing for these sales are availability of capacity and power, reliability of service and price. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs.\nIncreased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect EU&I’s load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of EU&I to attract new customers and to retain existing customers.\nEnergy Capacity and Resources\nEU&I owns approximately 55,139 MW of generation capacity. For additional information on owned generation facilities, see Item 2, “Properties.”\nEnergy and capacity to serve customers are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause EU&I to purchase power for its customers may include, but are not limited to, generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, generation reliability, demand growth and price. EU&I has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy and reliability of power supply.\nEU&I’s generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements.\nSources of Electricity\nEU&I relies principally on natural gas, nuclear fuel and coal for its generation of electricity. The following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2024.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                       Cost of Delivered Fuel per Net\n                                                                                             Generation by Source                                                     Kilowatt-hour Generated (Cents)\n2024                                                                                 2023                    2022                    2024                          2023                          2022\nNatural gas and fuel oil(a)                              34.7   %                33.3   %                34.2   %               3.39                          3.81                          6.35     \nNuclear(a)                                               27.5   %                28.4   %                26.6   %               0.58                          0.58                          0.58     \nCoal(a)                                                  14.1   %                12.8   %                13.5   %               4.09                          4.07                          3.43     \nAll fuels (cost based on weighted average)(a)            76.3   %                74.5   %                74.3   %               2.51                          2.63                          3.75     \nHydroelectric and solar(b)                                1.9   %                 1.8   %                 1.5   %                                                                                    \nTotal generation                                         78.2   %                76.3   %                75.8   %                                                                                    \nPurchased power and net interchange                      21.8   %                23.7   %                24.2   %                                                                                    \nTotal sources of energy                                 100.0   %               100.0   %               100.0   %                                                                                    \n(a)    Statistics related to all fuels reflect EU&I's public utility ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities. \n(b)    Generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped-storage facilities during off-peak periods. \n\nBUSINESS    \nNatural Gas and Fuel Oil\nNatural gas and fuel oil supply, transportation and storage for EU&I’s generation fleet is purchased under standard industry agreements from various suppliers, including Piedmont. Natural gas supply agreements typically provide for a percentage of forecasted burns being procured over time, with varied expiration dates. EU&I believes it has access to an adequate supply of natural gas and fuel oil for the reasonably foreseeable future.\nEU&I has certain dual-fuel generating facilities that can operate utilizing both natural gas and fuel oil. The cost of EU&I’s natural gas and fuel oil is fixed price or determined by published market prices as reported in certain industry publications, plus any transportation and freight costs. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative instruments to manage a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas. Duke Energy Florida has agreed to not enter any new financial natural gas hedging contracts through December 2027.\nEU&I has firm interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation agreements and storage agreements in place to support generation needed for load requirements. EU&I may purchase additional shorter-term natural gas transportation and utilize natural gas interruptible transportation agreements to support generation needed for load requirements. The EU&I natural gas plants are served by various supply zones and multiple pipelines.\nNuclear\nThe industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates and services to convert, enrich and fabricate fuel assemblies.\nEU&I has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. EU&I staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, EU&I generally source these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multiyear contracts.\nEU&I has entered into fuel contracts that cover 100% of its uranium concentrates through at least 2029, 100% of its conversion services through at least 2034, 100% of its enrichment services through at least 2033, and 100% of its fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2027. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, EU&I believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services.\nCoal\nEU&I meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. EU&I uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts, which may have various price adjustment provisions and market reopeners, range from 2025 to 2029 for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, 2025 to 2028 for Duke Energy Florida, 2025 to 2027 for Duke Energy Ohio and 2025 to 2030 for Duke Energy Indiana. EU&I expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. EU&I has an adequate supply of coal under contract to meet its risk management guidelines regarding projected future consumption. Coal inventory levels may fluctuate as a result of volatility in natural gas prices and the associated impacts on coal-fired dispatch within the generation fleet. EU&I continues to actively manage its portfolio and has worked with suppliers to obtain increased flexibility in its coal contracts.\nCoal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Kentucky is primarily produced from mines along the Ohio River in Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. There are adequate domestic coal reserves to serve EU&I's coal generation needs through end of life. The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by EU&I is between 0.5% and 3.5% for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, between 1.0% and 3.5% for Duke Energy Florida, between 1.5% and 4.0% for Duke Energy Ohio and between 1.0% and 4.0% for Duke Energy Indiana. EU&I's environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission allowances, enable EU&I to satisfy current SO2 emission limitations for its existing facilities.\nPurchased Power\nEU&I acquires a portion of its capacity and system requirements through purchase obligations, leases and purchase capacity contracts. EU&I believes it can obtain adequate purchased power capacity to meet future system load needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected.\nThe following table summarizes purchased power for the previous three years:\n\n2024                                                                                       2023                  2022\nPurchase obligations and leases (in millions of MWh)(a)           32.1                  37.6                  41.2   \nPurchase capacity under contract (in MW)(b)                      3,202                 3,997                 4,028   \n(a)    Represents approximately 12% of total system requirements for 2024, 15% for 2023 and 16% for 2022.\n(b)    These agreements include approximately 182 MW of firm capacity for 2024, and 412 MW of firm capacity for 2023 and 2022 under contract by Duke Energy Florida with QFs.\n12\n\n\n\nBUSINESS    \nInventory\nEU&I must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2024, the inventory balance for EU&I was approximately $4.4 billion. For additional information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\nAsh Basin Management\nThe EPA has issued regulations related to the management of CCR from power plants, including the 2015 and 2024 CCR Rules. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and new and existing surface impoundments and establish requirements regarding design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post-closure care, and recordkeeping, notifications, and internet posting requirements for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, such as the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act). \nEU&I has and will periodically submit to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash impoundment remediation or closure plans. Closure plans must be approved and all associated permits issued before any work can begin. At all sites requiring CCR closure and groundwater remediation, closure methods and groundwater corrective action remedies have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs.\nThe 2015 and 2024 EPA CCR Rules and the Coal Ash Act leave the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy's electric utilities have included compliance costs associated with federal and state requirements in their respective rate proceedings. Additionally, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress’ wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. For additional information on the ash basins and recovery, see Item 7, \"Other Matters\" and Notes 4, 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively. \nNuclear Matters\nDuke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately $16.2 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies.”\nDuke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC and the PSCSC require Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to update cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years. The nuclear decommissioning liabilities are assessed and updated based on changes in cash flows provided in new studies as well as annual assessments to evaluate whether any indicators suggest a change in the estimate of the ARO is necessary.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of NDTF investments and the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2023 or 2024 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.\n\n                                                                                   NDTF                  Decommissioning                                    \n(in millions)                        December 31, 2024                December 31, 2023                            Costs                  Year of Cost Study\nDuke Energy                            $11,435                          $10,143                           $9,031                                2023 or 2024\nDuke Energy Carolinas(a)                 6,468                            5,686                            4,439                                        2023\nProgress Energy                          4,967                            4,457                            4,592                                        2024\nDuke Energy Progress(b)                  4,636                            4,075                            4,477                                        2024\nDuke Energy Florida(c)                     331           382                                                 115                                         N/A\n(a)    Decommissioning costs for Duke Energy Carolinas reflects its ownership interest in jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors. Duke Energy Carolinas' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study and a funding study were filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2024.\n(b)    Duke Energy Progress' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in February 2025. An updated funding study will be completed and filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2025.\n(c)    During 2019, Duke Energy Florida reached an agreement to transfer decommissioning work for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party and decommissioning costs are based on the agreement with this third party rather than a cost study. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively. Duke Energy Florida provides the FPSC periodic reports on the status and progress of decommissioning activities.\nThe NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC have allowed EU&I to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail and wholesale rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. EU&I believes the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balances and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations.”\n\nBUSINESS    \nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The government has not yet developed a storage facility or disposal capacity, so EU&I will continue to store spent fuel on its reactor sites.\nUnder federal law, the DOE is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The DOE terminated the project to license and develop a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada in 2010, and is currently taking no action to fulfill its responsibilities to dispose of spent fuel. \nUntil the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. Under current regulatory guidelines, Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. With certain modifications and approvals by the NRC to expand the on-site dry cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel dry storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space of spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for Brunswick, Catawba, McGuire, Oconee and Robinson. Crystal River Unit 3 ceased operation in 2013 and was placed in a SAFSTOR condition in January 2018. As of January 2018, all spent fuel at Crystal River Unit 3 has been transferred from the spent fuel pool to dry storage at an on-site independent spent fuel storage installation.\nThe nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction. \nEU&I is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. The following table includes the current year of expiration of nuclear operating licenses for nuclear stations in operation. In June 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a subsequent license renewal application for Oconee with the NRC to renew Oconee's operating license for an additional 20 years. Duke Energy has announced its intention to seek 20-year operating license renewals for each of the reactors it operates in Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,” for additional information.\n\nUnit                                Year of Expiration\nDuke Energy Carolinas                                 \nCatawba Units 1 and 2                             2043\nMcGuire Unit 1                                    2041\nMcGuire Unit 2                                    2043\nOconee Units 1 and 2                              2033\nOconee Unit 3                                     2034\nDuke Energy Progress                                  \nBrunswick Unit 1                                  2036\nBrunswick Unit 2                                  2034\nHarris                                            2046\nRobinson                                          2030\nThe NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. For additional information on nuclear decommissioning activity, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\nRegulation\nState\nThe state utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail electric service within their respective states. The state utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of EU&I’s generating facilities. CPCNs issued by the state utility commissions, as applicable, authorize EU&I to construct and operate its electric facilities and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state utility commission is required for the entities within EU&I to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\nIn addition to rates approved in base rate cases, each of the state utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are prudent. \nFuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by EU&I. EU&I uses coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, oil, renewable generation and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of EU&I, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of EU&I.\n\nBUSINESS    \nThe table below reflects significant electric rate case applications approved and effective in the past three years and applications currently pending approval.\n\n                                                               RegulatoryBody           RevenueIncrease(Decrease)(in millions)       ReturnonEquity       EquityComponent ofCapital Structure        EffectiveDate\nApproved Rate Cases:                                                                                                                                                                                              \nDuke Energy Indiana 2024 Rate Case                             IURC                                        $385                         9.75      %                          53             %           March 2025\nDuke Energy Florida 2024 Rate Case(a)                          FPSC                                         203                         10.3      %                          53             %         January 2025\nDuke Energy Carolinas 2024 South Carolina Rate Case            PSCSC                                        150                         9.94      %                       51.21             %          August 2024\nDuke Energy Carolinas 2023 North Carolina Rate Case(b)         NCUC                                         768                         10.1      %                          53             %         January 2024\nDuke Energy Kentucky 2022 Kentucky Electric Rate Case(c)       KPSC                                          48                         9.75      %                      52.145             %         October 2023\nDuke Energy Progress 2022 North Carolina Rate Case(d)          NCUC                                         494                          9.8      %                          53             %         October 2023\nDuke Energy Progress 2022 South Carolina Rate Case             PSCSC                                         36                          9.6      %                       52.43             %           April 2023\nDuke Energy Ohio 2021 Ohio Electric Rate Case                  PUCO                                          23                          9.5      %                        50.5             %         January 2023\nDuke Energy Florida 2021 Settlement agreement(e)               FPSC                                         195                         9.85      %                          53             %         January 2022\nPending Rate Cases:                                                                                                                                                                                               \nDuke Energy Kentucky 2024 Kentucky Electric Rate Case          KPSC                                          70                        10.85      %                      52.728             %            July 2025\n(a)    In Year 2, rates will increase by $59 million.

For more details, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”\nFederal\nThe FERC approves EU&I’s cost-based rates for electric sales to certain power and transmission wholesale customers. Regulations of FERC and the state utility commissions govern access to regulated electric and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with EU&I.\nRTOs\nPJM and MISO are the ISOs and FERC-approved RTOs for the regions in which Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana operate. PJM and MISO operate energy, capacity and other markets, and control the day-to-day operations of bulk power systems through central dispatch.\nDuke Energy Ohio is a member of PJM and Duke Energy Indiana is a member of MISO. Transmission owners in these RTOs have turned over control of their transmission facilities and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of the RTOs. Transmission service is provided on a regionwide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the RTO members at rates based on the costs of transmission service.\nEnvironmental\nEU&I is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. For a discussion of environmental regulation, see “Environmental Matters” in this section. See the “Other Matters” section of Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke Energy’s operations.\nGAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE \nGU&I conducts natural gas operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Piedmont, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky. The natural gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO, KPSC, TPUC, PHMSA and the FERC. GU&I serves residential, commercial, industrial and power generation natural gas customers, including customers served by municipalities who are wholesale customers. GU&I has over 1.7 million total customers, including approximately 1.2 million customers located in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, and an additional 560,000 customers located within southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. In the Carolinas, Ohio and Kentucky, the service areas are comprised of numerous cities, towns and communities. In Tennessee, the service area is the metropolitan area of Nashville. The following map shows the service territory for GU&I as of December 31, 2024.\n\nBUSINESS    \n![alt  200477-B-gas-service-map-update-FINAL.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326160/000132616025000072/duk-20241231_g3.jpg)\nThe number of residential, commercial and industrial customers within the GU&I service territory is expected to increase over time. Average usage per residential customer is expected to remain flat or decline for the foreseeable future; however, decoupled rates in North Carolina and various rate design mechanisms in other jurisdictions partially mitigate the impact of the declining usage per customer on overall profitability. \nGU&I also has investments in various pipeline transmission projects, renewable natural gas projects and natural gas storage facilities. \nNatural Gas for Retail Distribution\nGU&I is responsible for the distribution of natural gas to retail customers in its North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky service territories. GU&I’s natural gas procurement strategy is to contract primarily with major and independent producers and marketers for natural gas supply. It also purchases a diverse portfolio of transportation and storage service from interstate pipelines. This strategy allows GU&I to assure reliable natural gas supply and transportation for its firm customers during peak winter conditions. When firm pipeline services or contracted natural gas supplies are temporarily not needed due to market demand fluctuations, GU&I may release these services and supplies in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions and/or make wholesale secondary market sales. In 2024, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided for approximately 100% of the natural gas supply for both Piedmont and Duke Energy Ohio during the winter months and 100% of forecasted demand was under contract prior to the winter heating season.\nImpact of Weather\nGU&I revenues are generally protected from the impact of weather fluctuations due to the regulatory mechanisms that are available in most service territories. In North Carolina, margin decoupling provides protection from both weather and other usage variations like conservation for residential and small and medium commercial customers. Margin decoupling provides a set margin per customer independent of actual usage. In South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, weather normalization adjusts revenues either up or down depending on how much warmer or colder than normal a given month has been. Weather normalization adjustments occur from November through March in South Carolina, from October through April in Tennessee and from November through April in Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio collects most of its non-fuel revenue through a fixed monthly charge that is not impacted by usage fluctuations that result from weather changes or conservation.\nCompetition\nGU&I’s businesses operate as the sole provider of natural gas service within their retail service territories. GU&I owns and operates facilities necessary to transport and distribute natural gas. GU&I earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the underlying commodity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable natural gas service at fair prices. \n\nBUSINESS    \nIn residential, commercial and industrial customer markets, natural gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy, primarily electric companies, propane and fuel oil dealers, renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants, as well as nuclear energy. A significant competitive factor is price. GU&I's primary product competition is with electricity for space heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic or market conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs. \nHigher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode GU&I's competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas, impair GU&I's ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass GU&I's systems in favor of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer growth for GU&I and could cause customers to reduce or cease using natural gas, thereby reducing GU&I's ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow its business, adversely affecting its earnings. \nNatural Gas Investments\nDuke Energy, through its GU&I segment, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail. Sabal Trail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal Trail Natural Gas Pipeline, which is regulated by FERC and traverses Alabama, Georgia, and Florida to transport natural gas to Florida. Duke Energy, also through its GU&I segment, has a 47% equity ownership interest in ACP and investments in various renewable natural gas joint ventures. Duke Energy determined that it would no longer invest in ACP, and the construction of the ACP pipeline, in 2020.\nGU&I has a 21.49% equity ownership interest in Cardinal, an intrastate pipeline located in North Carolina regulated by the NCUC, a 45% equity ownership in Pine Needle, an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in North Carolina and a 50% equity ownership interest in Hardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and Hampshire counties in West Virginia. Pine Needle and Hardy Storage are regulated by FERC.\nGU&I sold all of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities and related real property to Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC in February 2023 for approximately book value.\nSee Notes 4, 13 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\" and \"Variable Interest Entities,\" respectively, for further information on Duke Energy's and GU&I's natural gas investments. \nInventory\nGU&I must maintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2024, the inventory balance for GU&I was $95 million. For more information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nRegulation\nState\nThe state utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail natural gas service within their respective states. The state utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of GU&I’s natural gas distribution facilities. CPCNs issued by the state utility commissions or other government agencies, as applicable, authorize GU&I to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state utility commission is required for GU&I to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\nIn addition to amounts collected from customers through approved base rates, each of the state utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent. \nNatural gas costs are eligible for recovery by GU&I. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of GU&I, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of GU&I. GU&I also has various regulatory mechanisms in place to track and recover certain costs associated with capital investments including the IMR in North Carolina, ARM in Tennessee, and CEP Rider in Ohio. \n\nBUSINESS    \nThe following table summarizes certain components underlying significant recently approved and effective base rates in the last three years.\n\n                                                               RegulatoryBody           RevenueIncrease(Decrease)(in millions)                   ReturnonEquity                   EquityComponent ofCapital Structure   Effective Date    \nApproved Rate Cases:                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nPiedmont 2024 North Carolina Rate Case(a)                      NCUC                                         $88                                      9.8      %                                   52.30             %   November 2024     \nDuke Energy Ohio 2022 Natural Gas Base Rate Case               PUCO                                          32                                      9.6      %                                   52.32             %   November 2023     \nDuke Energy Kentucky 2021 Natural Gas Base Rate Case(b)        KPSC                                           9                                    9.375      %                                  51.344             %   January 2022      \n(a)    Year 2 and thereafter will include an additional $10 million in revenues. \n(b)    An ROE of 9.3% for natural gas riders was approved.\nFor more information on rate matters and other regulatory proceedings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”\nFederal\nGU&I is subject to various federal regulations, including regulations that are particular to the natural gas industry.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to other disclosures within this Form 10-K, including \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Matters Impacting Future Results\" for each registrant in Item 7, and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be considered in evaluating Duke Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought. Unless otherwise indicated, risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with all of the Duke Energy Registrants. Risks identified at the Subsidiary Registrant level are generally applicable to Duke Energy.\n\nRISK FACTORS      \nBUSINESS STRATEGY RISKS\nDuke Energy’s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy to reliably and affordably serve its customers while also balancing its grid and fleet modernization objectives and carbon emissions reduction goals.\nDuke Energy’s results of operations depend, in significant part, on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy and goals successfully. Duke Energy is working to meet growing and evolving customer energy needs while balancing customer reliability and affordability, and other priorities including the need to modernize its fleet and the regulatory construct. Duke Energy is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control and may make those goals difficult to achieve. \nFederal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of, and increase the costs associated with the use of, fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable Duke Energy to reduce its carbon emissions. For example, Duke Energy anticipates that its nuclear stations in North Carolina and South Carolina will continue to qualify for significant tax incentives in the form of nuclear production tax credits under the IRA. Nuclear energy is a reliable and clean energy source and nuclear tax incentives allowed under the IRA, including nuclear production tax credits, are expected to reduce the cost of the energy transition for our customers. If such nuclear production tax credits were eliminated or reduced, it could negatively impact our ability to return the anticipated cost benefits to customers.\nAdditionally, new EPA rules issued in April 2024 impose stringent GHG emission reduction standards, revised air toxic limits, and wastewater discharge limitations that may impact our carbon-reduction targets, and operational timeline and costs associated with certain new and existing generation. Supportive policies may be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transmission and distribution upgrades needed to accommodate the build out of large volumes of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the Company to continue to retire existing carbon emitting assets or make investments in new generating capacity. The Company may be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on time. In addition, new technologies that are not yet commercially available or are unproven at utility scale will likely be needed, including carbon capture and sequestration and supporting infrastructure as well as new resources capable of following electric load over long durations such as advanced nuclear, hydrogen and long-duration storage. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, Duke Energy’s ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk.\nMeeting the evolving and growing energy needs of our customers will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, may challenge our ability to meet customer expectations of reliability and affordability in a carbon constrained environment, particularly as demand increases. Our nuclear fleet is central to our ability to meet these objectives and customer expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond midcentury. Failure to receive approval from the NRC for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050.\nAs a consequence, Duke Energy may not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results of its energy transition strategy, which may have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\nREGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility revenues, earnings and results of operations are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility commissions, retail electric and natural gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease the Duke Energy Registrants’ earnings. Additionally, if regulatory or legislative bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a timely basis, the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be negatively impacted. Differences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations, such as North Carolina and South Carolina in Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' service territory, may also result in failure to recover costs.\nIf legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the Duke Energy Registrants’ exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively impacted. Federal and state regulations, laws, commercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of EE measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in Duke Energy service territories or result in customers leaving the electric distribution system and an increase in customer net energy metering, which allows customers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power up to the full retail credit amount. Over time, customer adoption of these technologies could result in Duke Energy not being able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation. \n\nRISK FACTORS      \nState regulators have approved various mechanisms to stabilize natural gas utility margins, including margin decoupling in North Carolina and rate stabilization in South Carolina. Additionally, certain jurisdictions have established performance incentive mechanisms and revenue decoupling mechanisms for EU&I. Performance incentive mechanisms condition some portion of the respective utility's earnings on its performance on established measurable consumer, utility system, or public policy outcomes. Revenue decoupling mechanisms provide periodic rate adjustments to ensure actual revenues match allowed revenues for certain customer classes. State regulators have also approved other margin stabilizing mechanisms that, for example, allow for recovery of margin losses associated with negotiated transactions designed to retain large volume customers that could use alternative fuels or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply through their own connection to an interstate pipeline. If regulators decided to discontinue the Duke Energy Registrants' use of tariff mechanisms or other mechanisms intended to stabilize utility margins, it would negatively impact results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, regulatory authorities also review whether natural gas costs are prudently incurred and can disallow the recovery of a portion of natural gas costs that the Duke Energy Registrants seek to recover from customers, which would adversely impact earnings.\nThe rates that the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility businesses are allowed to charge are established by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings, which may limit their ability to recover costs and earn an appropriate return on investment. \nThe rates that the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility businesses are allowed to charge significantly influences the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The regulation of the rates that the regulated utility businesses charge customers is determined, in large part, by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings. Negative decisions made by these regulators, or by any court on appeal of a rate case proceeding, have, and in the future could have, a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position or cash flows and affect the ability of the Duke Energy Registrants to adequately recover costs on a timely basis, including an appropriate return on the significant infrastructure investments being made. \nDeregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position or cash flows and their utility businesses.\nIncreased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have a significant adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position or cash flows and their utility businesses. If the retail jurisdictions served by the Duke Energy Registrants become subject to deregulation, the impairment of assets, loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital, and recovery of stranded costs could have a significant adverse financial impact on the Duke Energy Registrants. Stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of the Duke Energy Registrants whose value in a competitive marketplace may be less than their current book value, as well as above-market purchased power commitments from QFs from whom the Duke Energy Registrants are legally obligated to purchase energy at an avoided cost rate under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict if or when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation and a wide variety of laws and governmental policies, including taxes and environmental regulations, that may change over time in ways that affect operations and costs.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to regulations under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state regulations and policies, including by FERC, NRC, EPA and various other federal agencies as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses, including, among other things, their ability to: take fundamental business management actions; determine the terms and rates for services; make acquisitions; issue equity or debt securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates; and pay dividends upstream to the Duke Energy Registrants. Changes to federal regulations are continuous and ongoing. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies, including tax incentives and credits, will not be changed in ways that result in material modifications of business models and objectives or affect returns on investment by restricting activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs, causing delays, or prohibiting them outright, which could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such potential changes that may have adverse consequences could include no longer allowing tax incentives and credits currently provided for under the IRA, including the ability to record or sell related tax credits to third parties.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost of operations, and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure to environmental liabilities.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including CCRs, air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. For example, new EPA\nrules issued in April 2024, among other things, impose stringent GHG emissions limitations on existing coal plants and new natural gas plants\nand more stringent air toxic limits on existing coal plants, increase limitations on wastewater discharge, and impose groundwater monitoring and\ncorrective action requirements on previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities (CCR Management Units) and inactive surface\nimpoundments at retired generating facilities (Legacy CCR Surface Impoundments). Potential legal challenges to such rules may not be\nsuccessful, and adherence to these rules may increase the cost of compliance, impact generation resource mix and carbon-reduction targets,\nand negatively impact customer reliability and affordability due to such rules' imposition of stringent GHG emissions limitations and reliance on\ncarbon capture technologies that are not yet adequately demonstrated at utility scale. These and other environmental laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs.\nThese laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets, as well as reputational damage. The steps the Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses. Further, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and their contracts with customers. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects. Delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in \n\nRISK FACTORS      \nenvironmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could, and are likely to, result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. The costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe EPA has issued or proposed federal regulations, including the new rules issued in April 2024, governing the management of wastewater, CCR management units and CO2 emissions. New state legislation in response to such regulations could impose carbon reduction goals that are more aggressive than the Company's plans. These regulations may require the Duke Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' operations, capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes related to the impacts of global climate change.\nThere is continued concern, and increasing and conflicting activism, both nationally and internationally, about climate change. The EPA and state regulators have, and may adopt and implement, additional regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs to address global climate change, as well as reporting requirements regarding such emissions and related climate-goal claims. Certain local and state jurisdictions have also enacted laws to restrict or prevent new natural gas infrastructure. Increased regulation of GHG emissions and reporting requirements could impose significant additional costs on the Duke Energy Registrants' electric and natural gas operations, their suppliers and customers and affect demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact both our electric and natural gas businesses. Regulatory changes and/or uncertainty of applicability of such legislative and regulatory initiatives could also result in generation facilities to be retired earlier than planned to meet our net-zero 2050 goal. Though we would plan to seek cost recovery for investments related to GHG emissions reductions through regulatory rate structures, changes in the regulatory climate could result in the delay in or failure to fully recover such costs and investment in generation. \nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control.\nSustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate and negatively influence operations. Declines in demand for electricity or natural gas as a result of economic downturns in the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and the use of natural gas. Although the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated electric and natural gas businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel and purchased natural gas costs, under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity or natural gas sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations.\nA continuation of adverse economic conditions including economic downturn or high commodity prices could also negatively impact the financial stability of certain of our customers and result in their inability to pay for electric and natural gas services. This could lead to increased bad debt expense and higher allowance for doubtful account reserves for the Duke Energy Registrants and result in delayed or unrecovered operating costs and lower financial results. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values. The Duke Energy Registrants also monitor the impacts of inflation on the procurement of goods and services and seek to minimize its effects in future periods through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. Rapidly rising prices as a result of inflation, tariffs, or other factors may impact the ability of the Company to recover costs timely or execute on its business strategy including the achievement of growth objectives. \nThe Duke Energy Registrants sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. With respect to such transactions, the Duke Energy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices. These market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and could negatively impact the Company's ability to accurately forecast the financial impact or reduce the Duke Energy Registrants’ revenues and margins, thereby diminishing results of operations.\nFactors that could impact sales volumes, generation of electricity and market prices at which the Duke Energy Registrants are able to sell electricity and natural gas are as follows:\n•weather conditions, including extreme winter or summer weather that could cause significantly lower or higher demand for energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purposes, as applicable, storm-related customer outages resulting in lower usage, or periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an economical manner;\n•supply of and demand for energy commodities, including potential usage of electricity by data centers;\n•transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies;\n•availability of purchased power;\n•availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal, nuclear or natural gas plants, and customer usage of energy-efficient equipment that reduces energy demand;\n•natural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices;\n•ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, including materials, supplies, and fuel such as coal, natural gas and uranium; and\n•capacity and transmission service into, or out of, the Duke Energy Registrants’ markets.\n\nRISK FACTORS      \nNatural disasters or operational accidents may adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ operating results, financial position or cash flows.\nNatural disasters or operational accidents within the Company or industry (such as wild fires, earthquakes, hurricanes or natural gas transmission pipeline explosions) could have direct or indirect impacts to the Duke Energy Registrants or to key contractors and suppliers. Such events can and in the past, have, negatively impacted sales volume such as in the case of storm-related customer outages resulting in lower usage, and costs to restore service and rebuild assets after such events may be, and in the case of hurricanes Helene and Milton experienced in 2024, have been, material and did impact the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants, and such events may do so in the future, until complete and timely cost recovery is approved and occurs under existing relevant regulatory mechanisms across our jurisdictions. Further, the generation of electricity and the transportation and storage of natural gas involve inherent operating risks that may result in accidents involving serious injury or loss of life, environmental damage or property damage. Such events could impact the Duke Energy Registrants through civil or criminal legal proceedings or changes to policies, laws and regulations whose compliance costs have a significant impact on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, if a serious operational accident were to occur, existing insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred, including potential litigation awards. Any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance as a result of such accident, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants could be negatively impacted due to their obligations to comply with federal and state regulations, laws, and other legal requirements that govern the operations, assessments, storage, closure, remediation, disposal and monitoring relating to CCR, the high costs and new rate impacts associated with implementing these new CCR-related requirements and the strategies and methods necessary to implement these requirements in compliance with these legal obligations.\nAs a result of electricity produced for decades at coal-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants manage large amounts of CCR that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfills or combined with water in surface impoundments, all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. A CCR-related operational incident could have a material adverse impact on the reputation and results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. \nThe 2015 CCR Rule classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving CCR but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. The rule establishes requirements regarding design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post-closure care, and recordkeeping, notifications, and internet posting requirements to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as well as additional legal requirements, including judicial orders.\nThe 2024 CCR Rule significantly expands the scope of the 2015 CCR Rule to apply to legacy CCR surface impoundments (inactive impoundments at retired facilities) and CCR management units (previously unregulated coal ash sources at regulated facilities). These federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures, including increased operating and maintenance costs, which could affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery. In addition, the timing for and amount of recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy's cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant AROs related to these CCR-related requirements. At all sites requiring CCR closure and groundwater remediation, closure methods and groundwater corrective action remedies have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are developed and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts. \nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers.\nGrowth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by several factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated EE measures, demand-side management goals, advancements in technology that may impact the energy usage by large commercial customers, such as data centers, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as inflation, tariffs, and interest rate volatility, population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.\nIn addition, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have passed legislation implementing the extension of certain tax credits to be used toward the costs of residential solar installation or have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates in response to concerns related to climate change. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of EE in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.\nAdvances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants. In addition, the electrification of buildings and appliances currently relying on natural gas could reduce the number of customers in our natural gas distribution business.\nSome or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may cause the failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nRISK FACTORS      \nFurthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have EE riders in place to recover the cost of EE programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' future results of operations may be impacted by changing or conflicting expectations and demands, particularly regarding environmental, social and governance concerns.\nDuke Energy’s ability to execute its strategy and achieve anticipated financial outcomes are influenced by the expectations of our customers, regulators, investors and stakeholders. Those expectations are based in part on the core fundamentals of reliability and affordability but are also increasingly focused on our ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services and offerings. Additionally, the risks of global climate change continue to shape our customers’ sustainability goals and energy needs as well as the investment and financing criteria of investors. Failure to meet these increasing expectations or to adequately address the risks and external pressures from regulators, customers, investors and other stakeholders may impact Duke Energy’s reputation and affect its ability to achieve favorable outcomes in future rate cases and the results of operations for the Duke Energy Registrants. Furthermore, the increasing use of social media and conflicting expectations and demands regarding environmental, social, and governance concerns, may accelerate and increase the potential scope of negative publicity we might receive and could increase the negative impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. \nAs it relates to electric generation, a diversified fleet with increasingly clean generation resources may facilitate more efficient financing and lower costs. Conversely, jurisdictions utilizing more carbon-intensive generation such as coal may experience difficulty attracting certain investors and obtaining the most economical financing terms available. Furthermore, with this heightened emphasis on environmental, social, and governance concerns, and climate change in particular, there is an increased risk of litigation, activism, and legislation from groups both in support of and opposed to various environmental, social and governance initiatives, which could cause delays and increase the costs of our energy transition.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather, including extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns from climate change.\nElectric power generation and natural gas distribution are generally seasonal businesses. In most parts of the U.S., the demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Demand for natural gas peaks during the winter months. Further, changing frequency or magnitude of extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, winter storms and severe weather, including from climate change, could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a result, the overall operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period-to-period comparison less relevant.\nSustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by hydroelectric plants, as well as fossil and nuclear plant operations, as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment. Furthermore, destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, droughts, extreme temperatures, and wild fires, including from climate change, can result in lost operating revenues due to outages, property damage or total loss, including downed transmission and distribution lines, personal injury, reputational harm, and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage, including incremental financing costs. The cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable or recoverable on a timely basis through the regulatory process and may impact the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission assets.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market. In addition, the growth of renewables and energy storage will put strains on existing transmission assets and require transmission and distribution upgrades. The FERC’s power transmission regulations require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke Energy Registrants’ ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered.\nThe different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures, which could affect growth and performance in these regions. In addition, the ISOs who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past, and may impose in the future, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the Duke Energy Registrants’ wholesale power marketing business. \nThe availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants purchase almost all of their natural gas supply from interstate sources that must be transported to the applicable service territories. Interstate pipeline companies transport the natural gas to the Duke Energy Registrants' systems under firm service agreements that are designed to meet the requirements of their core markets. A significant disruption to interstate pipelines capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to events including, but not limited to, operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or cyberattacks or other acts of war or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including remediation related to integrity inspections or regulations and laws enacted to address climate change, could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings. Moreover, if additional natural gas infrastructure, including, but not limited to, exploration and drilling rigs and platforms, processing and gathering systems, offshore pipelines, interstate pipelines and storage, cannot be built at a pace that meets demand, then growth opportunities could be limited.\n\nRISK FACTORS      \nFluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the Duke Energy Registrants’ operations as well as their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity and other energy-related commodities as a result of their ownership of energy-related assets. Fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses, subject to the approval of state utility commissions. Additionally, the Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, changing economic conditions, bankruptcies, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the Duke Energy Registrants' ability to operate their facilities. Should counterparties fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties.\nCertain of the Duke Energy Registrants’ hedge agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties, depending on the daily market-based calculation of financial exposure of the derivative positions. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties could negatively impact liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke Energy Registrants’ credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to market price activity.\nCyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses. \nCybersecurity risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication, magnitude and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches. Duke Energy relies on the continued operation of advanced digital information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. Additionally, connectivity to the internet continues to increase through grid modernization and other operational excellence initiatives. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure, increased connectivity to the internet and technology systems’ inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches, the Duke Energy Registrants face a heightened risk of cyberattacks from foreign or domestic sources and have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to cyberattacks designed to gain unauthorized access to information and/or information systems or to disrupt utility operations through computer viruses and phishing attempts either directly or indirectly through its material vendors or related third parties. In the event of a significant cybersecurity breach on either the Duke Energy Registrants or with one of our material vendors or related third parties, the Duke Energy Registrants could (i) have business operations disrupted, including the disruption of the operation of our natural gas and electric assets and the power grid, theft of confidential company, employee, retiree, shareholder, vendor or customer information, and general business systems and process interruption or compromise, including preventing the Duke Energy Registrants from servicing customers, collecting revenues or the recording, processing and/or reporting financial information correctly, (ii) experience substantial loss of revenues, repair and restoration costs, penalties and costs for lack of compliance with relevant regulations, implementation costs for additional security measures to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage. While Duke Energy maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance does not protect Duke Energy from such cyberattacks occurring, and while it does provide some potential mitigation of the financial impacts resulting from such cyberattacks, it is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses, costs or damage experienced. Also, the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to standards enacted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by FERC regarding protection of the physical and cybersecurity of critical infrastructure assets required for operating North America's bulk electric system. The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to regulations set by the NRC regarding the protection of digital computer and communication systems and networks required for the operation of nuclear power plants. The Duke Energy Registrants that operate designated critical pipelines that transport natural gas are also subject to security directives issued by the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requiring such registrants to implement specific cybersecurity mitigation measures. While the Duke Energy Registrants believe they are in compliance with, or, in the case of recent TSA security directives, are in the process of implementing such standards and regulations, the Duke Energy Registrants have from time to time been, and may in the future be, found to be in violation of such standards and regulations. In addition, compliance with or changes in the applicable standards and regulations may subject the Duke Energy Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures as well as substantial fines for non-compliance.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ operations have been and may be affected by pandemic health events in ways listed below and in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to respond to it resulted in widespread adverse consequences on the global economy and on the Duke Energy Registrants’ customers, third-party vendors, and other parties with whom we do business. If another pandemic or health epidemic or outbreak occurs and is significantly prolonged, it could impact the Duke Energy Registrants' business strategy, results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future as a result of delays in rate cases or other legal proceedings, an inability to obtain labor or equipment necessary for the construction of large capital projects, an inability to procure satisfactory levels of fuels or other necessary equipment for the continued production of electricity and delivery of natural gas, volatility in global equity securities markets, and the health and availability of our critical personnel and their ability to perform business functions.\n\nRISK FACTORS      \nDuke Energy Ohio’s and Duke Energy Indiana’s membership in an RTO presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe rules governing the various regional power markets may change, which could affect Duke Energy Ohio’s and Duke Energy Indiana’s costs and/or revenues. Both Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana have trackers to recover approved RTO costs, but to the degree Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO that are not approved for recovery, their results of operations may be impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in RTO transmission rate design, while being able to allocate costs of projects built by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana to others. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than their own internal planning process. In addition, RTOs have been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana.\nAs members of an RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are subject to certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation among RTO members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the RTO markets not covered by collateral requirements and those associated with complaint cases filed against an RTO that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO members.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled. \nDuke Energy’s long-term strategy requires the construction of new projects, either wholly owned or partially owned, which involve a number of risks, including construction delays, delays in or failure to receive required regulatory approvals and/or sitting or environmental permits, nonperformance by equipment and other third-party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs. To limit the risks of these construction projects, the Duke Energy Registrants enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur. In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.\nThe financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyberattacks, and natural disasters, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance covering risks that the Duke Energy Registrants and their respective competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that the Duke Energy Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred. Any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance, could adversely affect the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the affected Duke Energy Registrant.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.\nWhile we strive to maintain constructive communications with our shareholders, activist shareholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to affect changes and assert influence on our Board and management. Perceived uncertainties as to the future direction or governance of the Company may cause concern to our current or potential regulators, vendors or strategic partners, or make it more difficult to execute on our strategy or to attract and retain qualified personnel, which may have a material impact on our business and operating results.\nIn addition, actions such as those described above could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock, based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nNUCLEAR GENERATION RISKS\nDuke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities.\nOwnership interests in and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida subject them to various risks. These risks include, among other things: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the current or past operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives; and the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of nuclear facilities.\nOwnership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines or shut down a unit depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the NRC, which could be prompted by, among other things, events within or outside of the control of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as well as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants.\n\nRISK FACTORS      \nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND COMMON STOCK RISKS\nThe Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term debt and equity markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of which are beyond the Duke Energy Registrants’ control.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses are significantly financed through issuances of debt and equity. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from their assets. Accordingly, as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from their operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities, the Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term money markets as well as longer-term capital markets. The Subsidiary Registrants also rely on access to short-term intercompany borrowings. Access to capital markets may also be critical to finance unexpected material expenditures such as unusually volatile commodity costs or significant storm restoration activities for severe weather events. If the Duke Energy Registrants are not able to access debt or equity at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access debt and equity may limit the Duke Energy Registrants’ ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth.\nMarket disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include: economic downturns, unfavorable capital market conditions, market prices for natural gas and coal, geopolitical risks, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, or the overall health of the energy industry. Additionally, rapidly rising interest rates could impact the ability to affordably finance the capital plan or increase rates to customers and could have an impact on our ability to execute on our energy transition. The availability of credit under Duke Energy’s Master Credit Facility depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under the facility to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. Systemic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement.\nDuke Energy maintains a revolving credit facility to provide backup for its commercial paper program and letters of credit to support variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at the option of the holder. The facility includes borrowing sublimits for the Duke Energy Registrants, each of whom is a party to the credit facility, and financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity. Failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude Duke Energy from issuing commercial paper or the Duke Energy Registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the Master Credit Facility.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may materially adversely affect their liquidity.\nEach of the Duke Energy Registrants’ senior long-term debt issuances is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot ensure their senior long-term debt will be rated investment grade in the future.\nIf the rating agencies were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, if the short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited. \nA downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit, commodity and capacity agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements, which would require cash payments. All of these events would likely reduce the Duke Energy Registrants’ liquidity and profitability and could have a material effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nNon-compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ ability to execute future borrowings.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.\nMarket performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding.\nOwnership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets or if the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities exceeds the amount available in decommissioning funds and such costs cannot be recovered through insurance or regulatory mechanisms, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected.\n\nRISK FACTORS      \nPoor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants’ liquidity and results of operations.\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants’ proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, could have a material adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \nDuke Energy is a holding company and depends on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nBecause Duke Energy is a holding company with no operations or cash flows of its own, its ability to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock, is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Duke Energy, its subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied. These subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Duke Energy with funds. In addition, Duke Energy may provide capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on Duke Energy’s common and preferred stock.\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe failure of Duke Energy information technology systems, or the failure to enhance existing information technology systems and implement new technology, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses.\nDuke Energy’s operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, retirees and shareholders and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement and supply chain activities. Our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers, as well as their respective vendors, many of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future. These providers’ systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nIn addition to maintaining our current information technology systems, Duke Energy believes the digital transformation of its business is key to driving internal efficiencies as well as providing additional capabilities to customers. Duke Energy’s information technology systems are critical to cost-effective, reliable daily operations and our ability to effectively serve our customers. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions and we must enhance or replace our information technology systems in response. This involves significant development and implementation costs to keep pace with changing technologies, including artificial intelligence, and customer demand. If we fail to successfully implement critical technology, or if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands, such failure could materially adversely affect our business strategy as well as impact the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. \nPotential terrorist activities, or military or other actions, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the U.S. Information technology systems, transportation systems for our fuel sources including natural gas pipelines, transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups that could have a material adverse effect on Duke Energy Registrants' businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities, including nuclear power plants under the NRC’s design basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations.\nCertain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized, technology-enabled power grid. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected.",
