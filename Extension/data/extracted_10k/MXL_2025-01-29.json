      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCorporate Information\nWe incorporated in the State of Delaware in September 2003. Our executive offices are located at 5966 La Place Court, Suite 100, Carlsbad, California 92008, and our telephone number is (760) 692-0711.

We provide free of charge through a link on our website access to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practical after the reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Refer to Intellectual Property Rights section below for a list of our trademarks and trade names. All other trademarks and trade names appearing in this Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners.\nOverview\nWe are a provider of communications systems-on-chip, or SoCs, used in broadband, mobile and wireline infrastructure, data center, and industrial and multi-market applications. We are a fabless integrated circuit design company whose products integrate all or substantial portions of a high-speed communication system, including radio frequency, or RF, high-performance analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing, security engines, data compression and networking layers, and power management. Our ability to design analog and mixed-signal circuits in CMOS allows us to efficiently combine analog functionality and complex digital signal processing logic in the same integrated circuit. As a result, we believe our solutions have exceptional levels of functional integration and performance, low manufacturing cost, and reduced power consumption versus competition. These solutions also enable shorter design cycles, significant design flexibility and low system-level cost across a range of markets.\nOur customers primarily include electronics distributors, module makers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and original design manufacturers, or ODMs, which incorporate our products in a wide range of electronic devices. Examples of such devices include radio transceivers and modems for 4G/5G base-station and backhaul infrastructure; optical transceivers targeting hyperscale data centers; Wi-Fi and wireline routers for home networking; broadband modems compliant with Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications, or DOCSIS, passive optical fiber standards, or PON, and digital subscriber line, or DSL; as well as power management and interface products used in these and many other markets. In addition, we generate revenue from certain intellectual property sale agreements.\nIndustry Background\nOver the last three decades, ubiquitous internet connectivity has driven exponential growth in data content, delivery, distribution, and consumption. We expect this trend to continue owing to:\n•Accelerated expansion of advanced data center technologies and cloud-based services including, Amazon Web Service, or AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and software as service, or SAAS, in general;\n•The explosive emergence of artificial intelligence, or AI, platforms and services such as OpenAI/Bing and Google Bard, which broadly amplify human ability to harness high-performance computing within the data center;\n•Continued proliferation of on-demand Over-The-Top, or OTT, video services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+;\n•The “remote economy” accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift to work-from-home, and increasing reliance on services such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet;\n•The proliferation of “Internet of Things”, or IoT, including internet-connected devices and systems within the home, manufacturing industries, and enterprises; and\n•Large-scale proliferation and advancement of wireless broadband services, whether through 5G+ or WiFi, which act as an accelerant for all these technologies.\nThese factors, individually and combined, have created economic pressure to continuously upgrade network bandwidth and latency (i.e. the delay between sender and receiver) in order to exploit the exponential growth of the above activities. For example, cloud-based services increasingly require stringent low latency and extremely high-speed network connections between servers and storage within a data center. These cloud services may leverage generative AI, which requires racks of high-performance servers and storage connected by the fastest-available networks. They may also rely on real-time communication with systems of IoT devices including sensors, lighting, and actuators; smart speakers, smart lighting and other smart appliances in the connected home; commercial air-conditioning and refrigeration; video surveillance equipment; manufacturing machinery; and point-of-sale and asset tracking systems. All these usage scenarios depend on reliable, fast, low-latency networks, enabled by advances in semiconductor devices which integrate wide spectrum/broadband, high-frequency \nTable of Contents\n\ncircuits together with digital signal processing algorithms. Such devices not only expand the available network bandwidth, but also utilize that bandwidth more efficiently. \nMarkets\nThe above trends propel demand across many of our target end markets, such as:\n•Data Center Infrastructure: Inside hyperscale data centers operated by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and others, high-speed optical transceivers connect racks of servers and storage through a hierarchical network of switches and routers. Cloud services and machine learning are dependent upon the ability to interconnect vast numbers of servers and storage inside a data center with extremely low latency and the highest bandwidth to enable the entire data center to act as a single computing or data processing unit. Consequently, the data traffic growth inside the data center has significantly outstripped the data traffic flowing to and from the data center. Currently, while server connections are transitioning from 10Gbps to 25Gbps or 100Gbps speeds, router and switch connections are moving from 100G to 400 and 800Gbps interconnections, with the next generation of switch connections (under development) targeting 1600Gbps. These transitions are possible, in large part, owing to the innovations in semiconductor design, incorporating high-speed digital signal processing together with broadband analog and mixed signal circuits in advanced CMOS process nodes. The physical limits and challenges of removing the heat dissipated by these optical transceivers and switches are the primary barriers to even higher interconnect speeds. For all these reasons, improving the bandwidth and power efficiency of data center networking technology within and between data centers remains a critical challenge for the evolution of next-generation data centers. \n•5G Wireless Infrastructure: Expensive, finite, fractured and discontiguous 5G wireless spectrum is being utilized more efficiently by aggregating or bonding multiple non-contiguous channels of spectrum with highly complex radio transceivers in a wireless base-station radio unit. These complex radio transceivers can also be configured in large antenna arrays to direct wireless signals more efficiently to specific users, also known as Massive Multiple-Input Multiple Output beamforming, or MMIMO. Beamforming vastly improves the efficiency with which spectrum is used (thereby increasing network capacity), as well as cell tower coverage (range), allowing an operator to do more with less. Densification, the process of increasing the number of wireless base-stations per unit area, also improves network capacity and coverage. In turn, the wireless and optical backhaul transport networks required to connect the higher number of base-station cells must have greater data capacity. As a result, microwave wireless backhaul and fronthaul transport links are migrating to millimeter wave operating frequencies where the availability of spectrum improves data capacity by more than tenfold. Implementing 5G access and transport functionality within base-stations requires radio transceivers that can process larger radio spectrum bandwidths; have expanded RF range; compensate for signal distortion from high-power amplifiers; support beamforming in large antenna arrays; and have the ability to transport high-speed data to and from the network, all in a low-cost, power-efficient design.\n•Broadband Access: Several drivers of broadband services have grown in significance in the last few years, including hybrid work-from-home, and the number and diversity of streaming service offerings. The focal point of network performance to and within the location is a gateway. These gateways not only determine the internet speeds coming into the location, but also the speed at which content is distributed throughout the location. Broadband modems – whether coaxial, fiber, fixed wireless or DSL, are needed to process increasingly wider portions of the spectrum carried by these media. Advances in these modems, powered by advanced SoCs, are enabling operators to aggregate the bandwidth of more channels and to widen the channels themselves, thereby increasing the download and upload speeds available to the consumer. \n•Connectivity: Connectivity is ubiquitous in our modern and transforming economy, where increasingly every device, including those inside our smart homes, enterprises, manufacturing robots, automobiles, commercial infrastructure, personal computers, personal health wear and gadgets, etc. are connected to the internet and each other. For example, each broadband access gateway, which is the entry point for internet connection into a home, typically implements several different communication standards for distributing content and internet connectivity throughout, including Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Multimedia over Coax (MoCA), and power line communications. Each of these standards relies on dedicated transceivers and signal processing powered by custom semiconductor products. For example, newer generations of Wi-Fi utilize increasing multiplicity of transceivers to enhance throughput. Advanced implementations of Wi-Fi deploy as many as eight transceivers inside a single gateway box, combined with Wi-Fi extenders to improve coverage in a large area. Consequently, the number of transceivers required, whether for wireless or broadband wireline access and distribution, increases proportionally to the increase in the number of broadband access connections. All connectivity standards rely on \nTable of Contents\n\nmultiple wireless or wireline transceivers or single large bandwidth transceivers to improve the data handling capacity and ability to talk to multiple devices simultaneously.\n•Industrial & Multi-Market: Manufacturing systems are increasingly being connected to each other and to the cloud. Such connectivity enables a range of operational improvements, such as better plant utilization and scheduling, reduction in power consumption, and the detection of precursors to equipment failure, enabling proactive maintenance and management. Connectivity is also at the heart of powerful new approaches to plant management such as digital twinning and industrial AI. To make connectivity economical, legacy equipment and new installations need to communicate with each other via newer and older connectivity protocol standards. Our product portfolio, featuring serial interfaces, Universal Serial Bus, or USB, Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitters, or UARTS, Peripheral Component Interconnect Express, or PCIe, devices, data converters, and Power Management Integrated Circuits, or PMICs, is strategically positioned to capitalize on such growth opportunities in this expanding market. Such a diverse range of interface and bridge products effectively serves a broad spectrum of end markets, including industrial automation, process control and manufacturing IT, among others.\nTo summarize, the innovation in broadband, low power, integrated communication SoCs is the engine of competitiveness across a range of different businesses spanning broadband wireline access, mobile data services, hyperscale cloud data centers, and cloud computation and storage markets. This has led to a long term and continuing secular trend of compounded growth in demand for systems that feature multiplier RF, mixed signal, and high-performance analog and digital signal processing transceiver SoCs. \nChallenges Faced by Providers of Systems and RF Transceivers and High Speed Interconnects\nDesigning and implementing state-of-the-art RF and optical transceiver systems is difficult owing to the high operating frequency ranges and wide frequency bands employed by communication signals, and the low power budgets of applications. As an example of difficulty, system designers must contend with significantly more sources of interference and signal impairments than in the case of traditional narrow band, low-frequency communication systems. Wider bandwidths require faster devices, but demand has outstripped the rate at which semiconductor processes improve, particularly so for the mainstream CMOS process roadmap. \nThe key challenges of capturing and processing high quality broadband communications signals include:\n•Receiving RF/digital communications signals spanning multiple frequency bands over a wide spectrum: Many of the advanced high-data-rate applications require the simultaneous RF reception of multiple channels or frequency bands in order to first aggregate, and subsequently demodulate, the data signal, which is spread over discrete disparate frequency bands. Likewise, data transmission is achieved by disaggregating the user’s data signal and transmitting it over multiple available frequency bands spanning a wide frequency spectrum. For example, in the broadband gateway markets, it is necessary to support the simultaneous reception of multiple high-definition video streams, video conferencing, and data applications in many system designs. OEMs meet these stringent requirements via multiple narrow- or wide-band RF receivers, each of which is dedicated to the reception of a single frequency band. An alternate, but highly challenging, approach involves Full Spectrum Capture, or FSCTM, receiver SoCs, which can process the entire available RF frequency spectrum in the transmission medium. They can then select and aggregate the relevant frequency bands over which the data is spread using analog and mixed-signal digital co-processing techniques. In contrast, use of multiple discrete conventional narrowband RF receivers is impractical due to increased design complexity, overall cost, circuit board space, power consumption and heat dissipation limitations. In addition, such narrowband receiver implementations suffer from signal integrity issues, reliability, and thermal challenges owing to the proximity of sensitive multiple RF receivers and discrete components in a limited PCB footprint.\n•Signal Clarity Performance Requirements: In communications systems, performance is limited by the quality of the received/transmitted signal that can be supported throughout the channel bandwidth. Signal-to-noise, or SNR, ratio measures the strength of the desired signal relative to the sum of the noise and undesired signal energy in the same channel. High capacity 5G wireless cellular data networks operate across non-contiguous wireless spectrum bands, while wired coaxial cable and power-line networks require broadband RF transceivers supporting high SNR. Optical transceivers operate across the widest bandwidths available and must preserve the necessary SNR throughout their bandwidth. These transceiver systems must compensate for impairments introduced as the signal propagates through wire, fiber or wireless mediums, as well as isolate the desired signals from the undesired signals that are invariably present in their wide operating \nTable of Contents\n\nfrequency range. The undesired signals not only include the noise generated by the natural environment, but also interference produced by home appliances, enterprise communications equipment, and other wireless networking systems. For example, in 5G mobile infrastructure applications, a radio transceiver receiving a channel at 1710MHz must cope with reflections in the environment as well as interference from a neighboring channel at 1660MHz picked up by the receiving antenna. The transceiver must also compensate for distortion introduced by the strong signals out of the transmitting antenna. Analog and digital signal processing is employed to improve SNR in the received and transmitted signals. Beamforming and MMIMO of radio signals also significantly improves SNR ratio, but requires sophisticated RF, analog and digital signal co-processing, and software expertise. Broadband reception and beamforming of RF signals in mobile environments are extremely difficult to implement due to the stringent size, cost, and power consumption constraints. Also, higher order modulation of communication signals requires extremely high SNR to maximize data capacity in a finite spectrum, which greatly increases the difficulty of implementing broadband systems.\n•Power Consumption: Power consumption has become a major concern inside communication systems, including access gateways, wireless base-stations and data center infrastructure applications. For example, Wi-Fi capacity and bandwidth improvement require increasing the number of transceivers per access point with greater channel bandwidths. As a result, Wi-Fi gateway faces significant heat dissipation challenges within the system as more performance and functionality are squeezed into smaller enclosures. Likewise, within the data center, physical limitations in the ability to remove heat efficiently from network switches, and the optical transceivers plugged into them, are the main obstacles to increasing data center network bandwidth at and beyond 400Gbps speed per optical transceiver since these transceivers must fit into the same standardized module form factors as prior generations. These switches and transceivers now consume an increasingly significant fraction of total data center power. In 5G wireless access infrastructure applications, the cost of provisioning power to base-station antenna towers and the operating cost attributable to energy consumption is high. In many multiple-transceiver system designs, a majority of the system’s overall power consumption can be ascribed to radio transceivers.\n•Size: The size of electronic components, such as RF transceivers and digital signal processing SoCs, is a key consideration for system designers and the service providers that deploy them. In wired optical infrastructure applications inside data centers, rapidly increasing network server and switch face-plate density trends are aggressively driving reduction of the size of optical transceiver interconnects. In 5G wireless infrastructure, space and weight capacity on the base-station radio towers where the radios and modems are mounted, is highly constrained and is a significant portion of operating costs. The deployment of MMIMO and antenna arrays, and cell densification for 5G wireless coverage and capacity, greatly increase the number of radio transceivers required in each base station radio tower and the number of base stations in a cell. As a result, there is a growing trend and an increasing need for highly complex integrated SoCs with greater numbers of transceivers per SoC.\nThere are also challenges that are specific to the processing of high-speed optical interconnect signals in our target data center markets.\n▪Optical Fiber Channel Impairments: The inherent optical properties of fiber cables and connectors result in impairments to the optical signal as it propagates along the fiber. These impairments degrade signal integrity due to the loss of light intensity, reflections from connectors, and other adverse modal, chromatic and polarization dispersion effects on the propagating light. Further, electrical signal impairments are introduced in the process of conversion of optical signals to electrical signals, which together reduce the maximum data throughput and limit the distance over which data can propagate over fiber. Therefore, communications SoCs present inside optical modules (often referred to as digital signal processors, or DSPs) are required to correct both electrical and optical signal impairments at both ends of the fiber termination.\n▪Photonics Device Technology: Today’s state-of-the art in photonic device technology lags the rapidly increasing speed requirements of data traffic within cloud data centers and optical transport links between telecom data centers. Photonic modulators often require relatively high voltage drive levels, while photodetectors are sensitive to speed degradation when connected to electrical circuits. This imposes severe limits to the high-speed conversion of electrical signals to optical signals, and vice versa, owing to the bandwidth limitations, nonlinearities, and noise properties in lasers, modulators, and photo detectors used in optical modules.\n▪Form Factor: Optical transceivers are required to conform to multi-source agreement, or MSA, standardized form factors, which in turn determine the number of transceiver ports that can fit in the face plates of standard server, storage, \nTable of Contents\n\nand switch rack units. Standardization of transceiver form factors and rack unit face plates allows data center operators to upgrade network speeds of existing installations by simply replacing older optical transceivers and switches with newer faster ones, rather than having to overhaul installed fiber infrastructure and floorplan. The dimensions of the standard face plate impose a severe constraint on the amount of heat that can be practically removed from a rack unit. A major challenge facing optical transceiver SoCs is to support exponentially growing data rates within the standardized form factor and thermal constraints.\nOur RF, Mixed-Signal and Digital SoC Platform Solutions\nWe are a provider of communications SoC solutions for the connected home, mobile and wireline infrastructure, data centers, and industrial and multi-market applications. Our products exemplify our core integrated circuit design and communications systems engineering capabilities:\n•Proprietary broadband/RF, analog and mixed-signal transceiver front ends: Our analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit designers implement complex broadband radio transceiver front-ends and data converters in standard silicon CMOS processes, which enables single-die integration of a complete digital signal processing communication system. This results in state-of-the-art performance, highest energy efficiency or lowest power, smallest form factor, and the lowest manufacturing cost of a target function. Our high-performance mixed-signal design capability, which involves the high-speed conversion of signals precisely and efficiently between analog and digital domains, is core to all our products and market applications, including high-speed optical interconnect applications inside data centers, 5G Access infrastructure MMIMO radios, and millimeter wave and microwave wireless backhaul transport.\n•Advanced digital signal processing ASIC design and algorithms: Our signal processing algorithm and digital application-specific integrated circuits, or ASIC, design expertise is at the core of our ability to employ digital signal processing to enable breakthroughs in CMOS analog RF front-end design and vice-versa. For example, impairments introduced by analog systems such as power amplifiers and photonics devices are canceled using sophisticated digital signal processing algorithms to achieve superior signal quality, reduce power consumption, and improve the speed of operation. Communication systems across a range of our current and future target markets share common signal processing functions, such as efficient error control coding, compensation for transmission medium or channel induced impairments, and digital processing of wideband signals. As such, algorithmic breakthroughs in one application are directly applicable to other product areas.\n•Embedded systems and software architecture: Our products contain complex integrated computer processing unit subsystems. These subsystems typically include multiple low-power microprocessor cores, packet processor, bus and peripherals, memory controllers, and interrupt processing. In addition to signal processing and supervisory activity functions, we also implement multiple layers of real-time embedded firmware and protocol stacks on a single chip. We believe our expertise and track record of successfully developing widely deployed, reliable embedded protocols for networking applications are essential to the evolution of connected home products of the future. Our firmware design capability is critical to the ease of use of our products in end customer platforms.\n•Architecture and system design for highly integrated end-to-end communication platform solutions: Our novel design techniques tradeoff individual signal path circuit level performance to optimize the overall system performance. Our holistic platform and system level design approach eliminates costly, and power-hungry overdesign of individual circuit elements. It allows us to address more complex customer problems that require a deeper understanding of the customer’s end product. Our products not only integrate the entire physical layer, or PHY, but also implement complete protocol stacks along with ready-for-use product level interface functionality and associated platform software. The integration of the entire system on a single-chip or utilizing minimal number of silicon dies reduces the number of external board-level components, decreases board space, improves performance, simplifies customers’ product design, and significantly reduces power consumption.\n•Low-power design methodology: The superior energy efficiency of our products reflects our years of cumulative experience and research and development, or R&D, investment in system architecture, semiconductor device modeling, and integrated circuit design expertise. At extremely high data rates, when electrical signals transit on and off the chip, there is a severe penalty in speed and power consumption. Therefore, significant reduction in power consumption of a device requires minimization of signal transitions between multiple chips. Our ability to achieve the highest levels of integration of all analog/RF and digital signal processing functionality on the same chip minimizes power consumption by eliminating such signal transitions. Our solutions disproportionately impact our end-customer’s product power dissipation, \nTable of Contents\n\nsuch as in cable modems, 400Gbps optical transceiver modules, and large 5G antenna radio transceiver arrays. Low power dissipation not only simplifies costly thermal design, but also eliminates the need for bulky fans and other cooling aids. This in turn improves end customer product reliability, increases the density of product features that can be supported in a compact footprint, and reduces overall system cost.\n•Scalable Platform: Our products share common, modular components such as data converters, radio architectures, signal processing algorithms, and digital signal processing circuit architectures, which enables us to offer fully integrated broadband RF transceiver based digital communication SoC solutions across a wide variety of markets while meeting the stringent performance requirements of these end market applications and standards. This contrasts to legacy solutions that require significant customization to conform to the various regional standards, technical performance and product feature requirements. As a result, our customers can minimize their design resources required to develop applications for multiple target markets using our platform solutions. In addition, we are able to deploy our engineering resources more efficiently to both diversify and address larger communications end markets.\nOur Strategy\nOur objective is to be the leading provider of communications SoCs for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multi-market applications. We continue to leverage our core analog and digital signal co-processing competencies to expand into other communications markets with similar performance requirements. The key elements of our strategy are:\n•Extend Technology Leadership in RF Transceivers and RF Transceiver + Digital Signal Processing + Embedded Processor SoCs: We believe that our success thus far is largely attributable to a combination of our RF and mixed-signal design capability together with advanced digital design expertise. We have leveraged this core competency to develop high-performance, low-cost semiconductor solutions for broadband communications applications spanning the connected home, wireless access and backhaul network infrastructure, and high-speed fiber-optic modules for data center, metro, and long-haul infrastructure markets. We will continue to invest in this capability and be an innovation leader in this market.\n•Leverage and Expand our Existing Customer Base: We target customers who are leaders in their respective markets. We focus on sales to customers who are leaders in our current target markets, and to build on our relationships with these leading customers to define and enhance our product roadmap. By solving the specific problems faced by our customers, we minimize the risks associated with our customers’ adoption of our new integrated circuit products and reduce the length of time from the start of product design to customer revenue. Further, engaging with market leaders will enable us to participate in emerging technology trends and new industry standards.\n•Target Additional High-Growth Markets: Our core competency is in RF analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit design in CMOS process technology. Several of the technological challenges involved in developing RF solutions for video broadcasting and broadband reception are common to a majority of broader communications markets. We intend to leverage our core competency in developing highly integrated RF transceiver and RF transceiver SoCs in standard CMOS process technology to address additional markets within broadband communications, communications infrastructure, and connectivity markets that we believe offer high growth potential.\n•Expand Global Presence: Due to the global nature of our supply chain and customer locations, we continue to expand our sales, design, operations and technical support organization both in the United States and overseas. In particular, we are aligned regionally to support to our customer base.\n•Attract and Retain Top Talent: We are committed to recruiting and retaining highly talented personnel with proven expertise in the design, development, marketing and sales of communications integrated circuits. We have assembled a high-quality team in all the areas of expertise required at an integrated circuit design and communications systems company. Providing an attractive work environment for all of our employees is important to us. We believe that our ability to attract the best engineers is a critical component of our future growth and success in our chosen markets.\nCustomers\nWe sell our products, directly and indirectly, to OEMs, module makers and ODMs, and we refer to these as our end customers. By providing a highly integrated reference design solution that our customers can incorporate in their products with \nTable of Contents\n\nminimal modifications, we enable our customers to design cost-effective high-performance SoC-based solutions rapidly. A significant portion of our sales are through distributors based in Asia, who then resell our product.\nA significant portion of our net revenue has historically been generated by a limited number of customers through sales of our products, as well as consideration under intellectual property sale agreements. In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, ten customers accounted for approximately 60%, 54% and 65% of our net revenue, respectively.\nProducts shipped to Asia accounted for 75%, 75% and 82% of our net revenue in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Products shipped to China accounted for 11% and 16% of our net revenue in the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and less than 10% in the year ended December 31, 2024. Although a large percentage of our products are shipped to Asia, we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers and incorporating our semiconductor products are then sold outside Asia. For example, revenue generated from sales of our modem products during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 related principally to sales to Asian ODM’s and contract manufacturers delivering products into European and North American markets. To date, all of our sales have been denominated in United States dollars. \nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, using our direct sales force, third party sales representatives, and a network of domestic and international distributors. We have direct sales personnel covering the United States, Europe and Asia. We also employ a staff of field applications engineers to provide direct engineering support locally to some of our customers.\nOur distributors are independent entities that assist us in identifying and servicing customers in a particular territory, usually on a non-exclusive basis. Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 44%, 50%, and 46% of our net revenue in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nOur sales cycles typically require a significant amount of time and a substantial expenditure of resources before we can realize revenue from the sale of products, if any. Our typical sales cycle consists of a multi-month sales and development process involving our customers’ system designers and management. \nWe generally receive purchase orders from our customers approximately six to twenty-six weeks prior to the scheduled product delivery date. Because of the scheduling requirements of our foundries and assembly and test contractors, we generally provide our contractors production forecasts six to twelve months in advance and place firm orders for products with our suppliers up to twenty-six weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date, in some cases without a purchase order from our own customers. Our standard warranty provides that products containing defects in materials, workmanship or product performance may be returned for a refund of the purchase price or for replacement, at our discretion.\nRaw Materials\nAs a fabless designer of integrated circuits, we do not directly procure raw materials and instead, rely on third parties to manufacture, assemble and test, or supply, our products, as described in further detail under the below heading “Manufacturing.” To a lesser extent, we also purchase certain turnkey, or finished goods product, for resale. Raw materials used by third party foundries, assembly and test contractors and turnkey product vendors include silicon wafers, as well as lead frames or substrate materials, gold or copper wires, and molding compounds used in assembly/packaging and test of our products. We work closely with our vendors in providing a supplier forecast three to twelve months in advance to ensure they have an adequate supply of raw materials to cover our forecast.\nManufacturing \nWe use third-party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our products. We also rely on certain vendors to supply turnkey products for certain products we sell. This outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design, sale and marketing of our products. Our engineers work closely with our foundries and other contractors to increase yield, lower manufacturing costs and improve product quality while maintaining a socially responsible supply chain. \nWafer Fabrication. We utilize an increasing range of process technologies to manufacture our products, from standard CMOS to more exotic processes including SiGe and GaAs. Within this range of processes, we use a variety of process technology nodes ranging from 0.25µ down to 3 nanometer. We depend on independent silicon foundry manufacturers to \nTable of Contents\n\nsupport our wafer fabrication requirements. Our key foundry partners include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, or TSMC, in Taiwan, and United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, in Taiwan and Singapore. We generally do not depend on a single source for the supply of our materials. Additionally, certain of products are supplied to us under the terms of a supply agreement with Intel.\nOutsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test. Upon completion of the silicon processing at the foundry, we forward the finished silicon wafers to independent semiconductor assembly and test service subcontractors. The majority of our assembly/packaging and test requirements are supported by the following independent subcontractors: Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE, Greatek Electronics, Inc., Signetics Corporation, SIGURD Microelectronics Corp., and Silicon Precision Industries.\nQuality Assurance. We have implemented significant quality assurance procedures to assure high levels of product quality for our customers. Our operations are certified under ISO 9001:2015 standards. We closely monitor the work-in-progress information and production records maintained by our suppliers, and communicate with our third-party contractors to assure high levels of product quality and an efficient manufacturing time cycle. Upon successful completion of the quality assurance procedures, all of our products are stored and shipped to our customers or distributors directly from third-party contractors and logistics agents in accordance with our shipping instructions.\nCorporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability\nAs we continue to expand our presence around the world, we are mindful of our responsibility to assess and mitigate climate risks, reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and maintain a socially responsible supply chain. Our board of directors and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees our corporate social responsibility and sustainability directives, while the Audit Committee oversees enterprise risk management, which includes an assessment of enterprise risks, including climate risks.\nClimate risk assessment. We have completed an initial assessment of climate risks utilizing the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure, or TCFD, Guidance on Risk Management Integration and Disclosure, and present disclosures around the risk assessment and other matters in accordance with TCFD guidance on our corporate social responsibility and sustainability page on our website.\nGreenhouse gas emissions. We are committed to contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and we are currently taking measures to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact such as purchasing 100% renewable energy for our facilities in California and elsewhere where available, using key suppliers that focus on sustainability as described below, enhancing our offices with energy saving improvements, and transitioning away from one-time use plastics used in the office to sustainable reusable products. For the latest information regarding measures we have taken to further reduce our emissions, refer to our corporate social responsibility and sustainability page on our website, where you can also find our annual emissions reporting.\nIn our development efforts, our engineers are consistently focused on improving the power efficiency and thermal performance of our chips, minimizing water consumption and waste, promoting recycling of reusable materials, and providing customer satisfaction through compliance with global environmental regulations as they relate to our products and operations. For more information regarding the power efficiency and thermal performance of our products, refer to our corporate social responsibility and sustainability page on our website. \nSocially responsible supply chain. As a fabless semiconductor design company, we do not manufacture our products and, with respect to the activities we conduct directly, we believe we leave a limited environmental footprint. With respect to our indirect environmental impact, we consider and monitor the practices of our current and prospective foundry partners and suppliers in assessing environmental risks in our supply chain and in selecting key vendors. We are committed to the use of a socially responsible supply chain to reduce the risk of human rights violations and the use of conflict minerals (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, or 3TG) from the Democratic Republic of Congo and certain adjoining countries. The results of our conflict minerals surveys are reported annually on a conflict minerals report. Our efforts also include maintaining an anti-slavery policy, and a business partner labor standards policy which bars the use of forced or child labor and slavery and a conflict minerals policy governing the use and distribution of 3TG minerals, as well as conducting due diligence before allowing a potential supplier to become a preferred supplier. Further, we remove any suppliers that continue to fail to meet our business partner labor standards and conflict minerals policies after being provided the opportunity to remedy non-compliance via implementation of a corrective action plan. We also participate in recycling of integrated circuits and boards. Additionally, our \nTable of Contents\n\nproducts are compliant with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, or REACH, standards in the European Union, or EU.\nResearch and Development \nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets. We direct our R&D efforts largely to the development of new high-performance, mixed-signal RF transceivers and SOCs for the broadband, mobile and wireline infrastructure, data center, and industrial and multi-market applications. We target applications that require stringent overall system performance and low power consumption. As new and challenging communication applications proliferate, we believe that many of these applications may benefit from our SoC solutions combining analog and mixed-signal processing with digital signal processing functions. We have assembled a team of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in RF, mixed-signal and high-performance analog integrated circuit design, digital signal processing, communications systems and SoC design. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 941 employees in our R&D group. Our engineering design teams are located in Carlsbad, Irvine, and San Jose in California; Singapore; Shanghai, and Shenzhen in China; Taipei and Hsinchu in Taiwan; Bangalore and Chennai in India; Canada, Germany, Israel, and Spain.\nCompetition \nWe compete with both established and development-stage semiconductor companies that design, manufacture and market analog and mixed-signal broadband RF receivers, high speed interconnects, high-performance interface, data and video compression and encryption, and power management products. Our competitors include companies with much longer operating histories, greater name recognition, and substantially greater financial, technical and operational resources, as well as smaller companies specializing in narrow markets, to internal or vertically integrated engineering groups within certain of our customers. In addition, our industry experiences substantial consolidation. We consider our primary competitors to be companies with a proven track record of supporting market leaders and the technical capability to develop and bring to market competing broadband RF receiver and RF receiver SoC, modem, and high speed interconnect products. Our primary merchant semiconductor competitors include Broadcom, Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Credo Semiconductor Inc., MediaTek, Inc., Marvell Technology Group Ltd., MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated, Analog Devices, Inc., Renesas Electronics Corporation, Microchip Technology Inc. and Semtech Corporation. Because our products often are building block semiconductors which provide functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits, we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits, some of which may be existing customers or platform partners that develop their own integrated circuit products. If we cannot offer an attractive solution for applications where our competitors offer more fully integrated products, we may lose significant market share to our competitors. Some of our targeted customers for our high speed interconnect solutions are module makers who are vertically integrated, where we compete with internally supplied components, and we compete with much larger analog and mixed-signal catalog competitors in the multi-market high-performance analog markets.\nThe market for RF, mixed-signal and high-performance analog semiconductor products is highly competitive, and we believe that it will grow more competitive as a result of continued technological advances. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:\n•product performance; \n•features and functionality; \n•energy efficiency; \n•size; \n•ease of system design;\n•customer support; \n•product roadmap;\n•reputation; \n•reliability; and \nTable of Contents\n\n•price.\nWe believe that we compete favorably as measured against each of these criteria. However, our ability to compete in the future will depend upon the successful design, development and marketing of compelling RF, analog, digital, and mixed-signal semiconductor integrated solutions for high growth communications markets. In addition, our competitive position will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain talent while protecting our intellectual property.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nOur success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to establish and adequately protect our proprietary technology and confidential information. To protect our technology and confidential information, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks. We also protect our proprietary technology and confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, business partners, consultants and advisors. Protecting mask works, or the “topography” or semiconductor material designs, of our integrated circuit products is of particular importance to our business and we seek to prevent or limit the ability of others to copy, reproduce or distribute our mask works.\nWe have over one thousand issued patents and numerous patent applications pending in the United States. We also have issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications. We file U.S and foreign patent applications to protect our intellectual property. Patents generally have a duration of twenty years from filing. While the remaining duration on the individual patents in our patent portfolio varies, we believe that the duration of our issued patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.\nWe own numerous trademarks related to our current products that have been registered in the United States and 4 pending U.S. trademark applications. We own foreign counterparts of certain of these registered trademarks in Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the EU, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and United Kingdom. We also claim common law rights in certain other trademarks that are not registered. Trademark rights may continue for a limited duration or in perpetuity, provided certain requirements are met.\nWe may not gain any competitive advantages from our patents and other intellectual property rights. Our existing and future patents may be circumvented, designed around, blocked or challenged as to inventorship, ownership, scope, validity or enforceability. It is possible that we may be provided with information in the future that could negatively affect the scope or enforceability of either our present or future patents. Furthermore, our pending and future patent applications may or may not be granted under the scope of the claims originally submitted in our patent applications. The scope of the claims submitted or granted may or may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. \nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation and other vigorous offensive and protective enforcement actions over rights to intellectual property. Moreover, there are numerous patents in the semiconductor industry, and new patents are being granted rapidly worldwide. Third parties may obtain patents that block or limit our ability to develop new technology and/or improve our existing products. If our products were found to infringe any patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties, we could be prevented from selling our products or be subject to litigation fees, statutory fines and/or other significant expenses. We have initiated and could in the future be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third-party’s patent or other proprietary rights, as described in “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual Property – We utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected\" and in “Item 3 – Legal Proceedings.” We may in the future be contacted by third parties suggesting that we seek a license to intellectual property rights that they may believe we are infringing. In addition, in the future, we may be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights, as described in “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property — We have settled in the past intellectual property litigation and may face additional claims of intellectual property infringement. Current litigation and any future litigation could be time-consuming, costly to defend or settle and result in the loss of significant rights” and in “Item 3 — Legal Proceedings.”\nTable of Contents\n\nGovernmental Regulation\nOur business and operations around the world are subject to government regulation at the international, national, state, provincial, and local level. These regulations impact various aspects of our business and include regulations regarding environmental, health, and safety matters, such as laws and regulations adopted by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration or similar authorities in other jurisdictions. We believe that our properties and operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws protecting the environment and worker health and safety. We do not manufacture our own products but do maintain laboratory space at certain of our facilities to facilitate the development, evaluation, and testing of our products. These laboratories may maintain quantities of hazardous materials. While we believe we are in material compliance with applicable law concerning the safeguarding of these materials and with respect to other matters relating to health, safety, and the environment, the risk of liability relating to hazardous conditions or materials cannot be eliminated completely. To date, we have not incurred significant expenditures relating to environmental compliance at our facilities nor have we experienced any material issues relating to employee health and safety. We cannot provide assurances, however, that issues will not arise in the future or that applicable law will not require us to incur significant compliance expenditures.\nCertain of our products and technology are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, which are administered by the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, and we are required to obtain an export license before we can export certain controlled products or technology to specified countries or customers. In addition, BIS imposes broad restrictions on certain identified entities and individuals, including those identified on the BIS “Denied Persons” list and BIS Entity List.\n Since October 2022, the United States government has taken steps to restrict the export of certain advanced semiconductor products and technology to the People’s Republic of China and/or certain companies located in China due to national security and human rights concerns. In October 2022, BIS announced additional restrictions on products and/or technology destined for use in the People’s Republic of China, including additional export controls and/or requirements on (1) certain advanced computing integrated circuits, computer commodities that contain such integrated circuits and certain semiconductor manufacturing items; (2) products and/or technologies that may be destined for facilities capable of producing certain advanced node integrated circuits; and (3) transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end uses. In October 2023, BIS announced additional restrictions on the export of certain advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing technology to China, primarily focused on integrated circuits with military, data center, or artificial intelligence applications. Pursuant to those October 2023 export control amendments, various categories of integrated circuits are now subject to export licensing and export control restrictions for export or reexport to China and certain other countries. Since October 2022, we have restricted or curtailed business with certain customers and partners in China as a result of BIS restrictions.\nWe have experienced and could continue to experience a loss of revenues or supply while we are obtaining licenses needed to do business with certain customers, suppliers, and any other business partners who are added to the Entity List, and failure to obtain any required license has resulted and could in the future result in a reduction of anticipated revenues or supply until an alternate source of supply can be obtained. We cannot guarantee that additional export control restrictions or any sanctions imposed in the future will not restrict, prevent, or materially limit, our ability to conduct business with certain customers, suppliers, business partners or in certain countries. Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to maintain ongoing compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or policies. Any such violations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations and laws. In addition, if our customers fail to comply with these regulations and laws, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. \nOur business is also subject to various rules and regulations applicable to multinational public companies in the semiconductor industry, including: federal securities laws; competition laws and regulations, such as those promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or authorities in the European Union; anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; and, additional global trade regulation, such as export controls and trade sanctions, among others. We are also subject to the rules and regulations of industry standards bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization, among others. These laws and regulations are complex, may change frequently and with \nTable of Contents\n\nlimited notice, and may continue to become more stringent over time. We may incur significant expenditures in a future period as a result.\nHuman Capital\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel, and achieving those objectives requires us to maintain a work environment and culture that values diversity. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset. We operate across eighteen countries and are sensitive to the many cultures and backgrounds constituting our employee base. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 1,294 full-time employees, including 941 in R&D, 213 in sales and marketing, 30 in operations and semiconductor technology and 110 in administration. We have employees across 17 countries: 52% are in Asia, 26% in the Americas, 12% in Europe and 10% in the Middle East. Our workforce is represented by the following race/ethnicities: 67% Asian, 24% White or Middle Eastern, 9% Latinx or Hispanic origin, with 53% Asian and 47% White or Middle Eastern in senior management. Females represented 29% of our outside directors, 7% of senior management, 14% of our technical roles, and 19% of our total workforce. Of our total employee workforce, 3% is represented by Work Councils in Austria and Germany. The Work Council groups, common to these countries, are comprised of employees elected by the general employee base. We consider our global employee relations to be good.\nOur human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, attracting and retaining talented and experienced employees, advisors, and consultants. We utilize multiple online search tools, specialized recruiting firms, employee referral programs and university hires to ensure a varied outreach approach for candidates. We aim to increase our hiring and retention of female talent including direct hires or interns from universities. We offer this via a combination of competitive base salary, time-based equity incentives and bonus plans linked to financial performance that are designed to motivate and reward personnel with annual grants of stock-based and cash-based incentive compensation awards to our employees, some of which vest over a period of four years, plus other benefits, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve both our short and long-term objectives. We offer competitive benefits tailored to local markets and laws and designed to support employee health, welfare and retirement; examples of such benefits may include hybrid work schedules with one flexible day allowing all employees globally to work from home; paid time off; 401(k), pension or other retirement plans; employee leave or part-time arrangements to support well-being of employees and their dependents; sabbaticals; bereavement leave; employee stock purchase plan; basic and voluntary life, disability and supplemental insurance; medical, dental and vision insurance; health savings and flexible spending accounts; relocation assistance; and employee assistance programs. Our global training and development program includes internal on-the-job training and we have launched a pilot training program which includes seminars, podcasts and recommended learnings under which we have received significant employee participation. Our corporate training program, which is mandatory, covers training on discrimination-free workplace, as well as our code of ethics and employee conduct, insider trading policy, global export controls and economic sanctions policy, global anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy, and anti-trust and competition law.\nOur executive compensation structure aligns executive incentives with the long-term growth objectives of MaxLinear, including long-term share price appreciation. In that regard, our executive compensation programs have tended to place a relatively heavier weighting on equity compensation than our peers and include a performance-based metric to executives’ equity incentives in addition to other forms of compensation offered to all employees. For more details regarding our executive compensation, refer to information incorporated by reference from the information set forth under the captions “Executive Compensation” and “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” in either an amendment to this Form 10-K or our upcoming 2025 Proxy Statement.\nWe also comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety and are subject to audits by entities such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, in the United States. We rely on third parties to manufacture our products and require our suppliers to maintain a safe work environment, as described in further detail under the above heading “Manufacturing.”\nSeasonality \nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, these and other factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry, and in our business in particular. \nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition, our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors, such as the overall demand volatility for semiconductor solutions across a diverse range of communications, industrial and multimarket applications, the timing of receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant orders, the gain or loss of significant customers, market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products, our ability to timely develop, introduce and market new products and technologies, the availability and cost of products from our suppliers, new product and technology introductions by competitors, intellectual property disputes and the timing and extent of product development costs. For example, we often experience flat-to-declining revenue in the first quarter of each fiscal year and increasing revenue in the second quarter of each fiscal year.",

We may from time to time make additional written and oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. However, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time by or on behalf of us, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. \nThe following discussion provides information concerning the material risks and uncertainties that we have identified and believe may adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations. Before you decide whether to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider these risk factors together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K, and in our other public filings, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. Our risk factors are not guarantees that no such conditions exist as of the date of this report and should not be interpreted as an affirmative statement that such risks or conditions have not materialized, in whole or in part. \nFor the risks relating to our terminated merger with Silicon Motion, please refer to the section of these risk factors captioned “Risks Relating to the Terminated Merger with Silicon Motion.”\nRisk Factor Summary\nRisks Relating to the Terminated Merger with Silicon Motion\n•The termination of the Merger Agreement and the related legal proceedings have caused us to incur substantial costs, may divert management’s attention from our business and could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial results and operations.\n•If we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\n•We face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and market share.\n•Global economic conditions, including factors such as high inflation or a potential recession, could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n•We are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\n•A significant variance in our operating results or rates of growth, if any, could continue to lead to substantial volatility in our stock price. Our revenue has declined, and we may not sustain our current level of revenue, which has declined, \nTable of Contents\n\nand/or manage future growth effectively. The impact of excess inventory in the channel has continued to influence our customers’ expected demand for certain of our products and negatively impact our revenue.\n•Our business, financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by military conflicts, geopolitical and economic tensions among or with countries in which we conduct business, including between the United States and China, Israel (and its conflicts with Iran and Lebanon), and among other countries. For example, as more entities are added to restricted export control lists, or as semiconductor technology exports to other countries are further controlled, our need to seek authorization from the U.S. government may impact our ability to do business and/or the speed with which we can deliver, if at all.\n•We also are subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflicts.\n•Changes in trade policies among the United States and other countries, in particular the imposition of new or higher tariffs, could place pressure on our average selling prices as our customers seek to offset the impact of increased tariffs on their own products. Increased tariffs or the imposition of other barriers to international trade could decrease demand and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\n•We will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or technology or if such authorizations are revoked. In addition, we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations.\n•We depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from major customers has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\n•Any legal proceedings or claims against us or potential violations of applicable regulations could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could harm our reputation regardless of the outcome.\n•We have been and may in the future be subject to information technology failures, including security breaches, cyber-attacks, design defects or system failures, that could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\n•Average selling prices of our products have previously decreased and could decrease in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margins.\n•If we fail to penetrate new applications and markets, our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\n•A significant portion of our revenue is attributable to demand for our products in markets for broadband solutions, and development delays and consolidation trends among cable and satellite Pay-TV and broadband operators has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect our future revenues and operating results.\n•We may be unable to make the substantial productive research and development investments that are required to remain competitive in our business.\n•The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses caused by undetected defects or bugs, which could reduce the market acceptance of our new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and adversely affect our operating costs.\n•Our revenue and operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\n•If we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired and our competitive position could be harmed.\n•We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and differences between our estimates of customer demand and product mix and our actual results could continue to negatively affect our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\n•We may have difficulty accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses particularly as we seek to enter new markets where we may not have prior experience.\n•Our customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process which does not assure product sales.\n•We incur significant expenditures to win business and customer product plan cancellations may adversely affect our results of operations.\n•A failure to maintain compliance with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n•If we are unable to attract, train and retain qualified personnel and senior management, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer.\n•We are subject to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance of our credit agreements and could continue to be adversely impacted by high interest rates in the future. Such indebtedness adversely affects our operating results and cash-flows, as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations and contains financial and operational covenants that could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to \nTable of Contents\n\nfinance such transactions. In addition, high interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and service our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products and our distributors’ business. \n•We are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. Our inability to comply with such obligations may negatively impact our business.\n•Our products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted by end users in our markets.\n•We may, from time to time, make additional business acquisitions or investments, which involve significant risks.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\n•We have settled in the past intellectual property litigation and may in the future face additional claims of intellectual property infringement including indemnification claims based on intellectual property allegations. Any current or future litigation could be time-consuming, costly to prosecute, defend or settle and result in damages and/or the loss of significant rights.\n•If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\n•We face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products.\n•The use of open source software in our products, processes and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nRisks Relating to Reliance on Third Parties\n•A lack of long-term supply contracts, and any supply disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n•Failure to manage our relationships with our third-party contractors successfully, or impacts from volatility in global supply, natural disasters, public health crises, or other labor stoppages in the regions where such contractors operate, could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.\n•Should any of our distributors cease or be forced to stop distributing our products, our business would suffer.\n•Any failure of third parties to provide services and technology could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\n•Our share price may be volatile as a result of various factors.\n•Our management team may use our available cash and cash equivalents in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a return.\n•Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to our Terminated Merger with Silicon Motion\nThe termination of the Merger Agreement and the related legal proceedings have caused us to incur substantial costs, may divert management’s attention from our business and could otherwise adversely affect our business, financial results and operations.\nWe terminated the Merger Agreement on July 26, 2023 and notified Silicon Motion that we are relieved of our obligation to close the merger. Silicon Motion has challenged the validity of that termination. On August 16, 2023, Silicon Motion delivered to us a notice, which Silicon Motion publicly disclosed, that it was purporting to terminate the Merger Agreement and that Silicon Motion would be commencing an arbitration before the Singapore International Arbitration Centre to seek damages from us arising from our alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement. On October 5, 2023, Silicon Motion filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre alleging that we breached the Merger Agreement. Additionally, on August 31, 2023, a Silicon Motion stockholder filed a class action complaint against us and certain of our current officers alleging that we materially misrepresented the likelihood the merger would close, and a similar individual action was filed by a different Silicon Motion stockholder on June 13, 2024. Other potential plaintiffs may file additional lawsuits related to the previously contemplated merger. See Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) of this report for more information on the Silicon Motion arbitration and the class action lawsuit. We intend to vigorously defend against these legal proceedings and any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, but due to the uncertainties inherent in any legal proceedings, we cannot predict the outcome of any legal proceedings. Legal proceedings are time-consuming, and may divert management’s attention from our business. Legal proceedings are also expensive and could result in substantial costs to us, including any damages we are required to pay and costs associated with the indemnification of directors and officers. Please refer to the Risk Factor entitled “If we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger \nTable of Contents\n\nAgreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments. Even if we are able to finance such payments through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any material increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations. Issuing additional shares of our common stock, if material, will result in dilution of existing shares outstanding. Any loan agreement is also expected to contain financial and operational covenants that would adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions.”\nWe have already incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial costs in connection with the previously pending merger, the termination of the Merger Agreement, and the related legal proceedings. Aside from any damages or settlement amounts we may be required to pay, these costs are primarily associated with the fees of our financial advisors, accountants, lenders, and legal counsel. Since the merger has been terminated, we will have received little or no benefit in respect of such costs incurred. We may also experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our suppliers, customers, customer prospects, and employees with regard to legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition or on the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments. Even if we are able to finance such payments through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any material increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations. Issuing additional shares of our common stock, if material, will result in dilution of existing shares outstanding. Any loan agreement is also expected to contain financial and operational covenants that would adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions.\nIf we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments. However, if we finance all or a portion of the payment of damages or settlement amounts through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any material payment and increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our ability to use cash generated from operations as we repay interest and principal under the term loans and revolving credit facility, as applicable. Issuing additional shares of common stock, if material, would result in dilution of existing shares outstanding. In addition, our current credit agreement, and any new loan agreements, contain and would likely contain financial and operational covenants that may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain activities, including certain financing and acquisition transactions, any future stock repurchases, guarantees, and similar transactions, without obtaining the consent of the lenders, which may or may not be forthcoming. Such financial and operational covenants include compliance with a secured net leverage ratio test. Accordingly, outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders.\nSpecifically, if we are required to pay damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, including for alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, and we finance all or a portion of the payment of damages through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any materially increased indebtedness could have important consequences to investors in our common stock, including the following:\nTable of Contents\n\n•our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, or other purposes may be limited or financing may be unavailable;\n•high interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and service our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products as well as the business of our distributors; \n•we could be subject to substantial variable interest rate risk because our interest rate under term loans typically varies based on a fixed margin over an indexed rate (such as for the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement) or an adjusted base rate. If interest rates were to increase substantially, and we incur additional indebtedness, it would adversely affect our operating results and could affect our ability to service the indebtedness;\n•a portion of our cash flows is dedicated to the payment of interest and when applicable, principal, on our indebtedness and other obligations and will not be available for use in our business;\n•our level of indebtedness, combined with high interest rates, could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate, including limiting our future investments or ability to enter into acquisitions and strategic partnerships, and obtain financing for such transactions; and\n•our high degree of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and/or a downturn in our business, thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations.\nIf we fail to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with other covenants in our debt service agreements, we would be in default under the terms of these agreements. Subject to customary cure rights, any default would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate repayment of this debt and could cause defaults under other indebtedness that we have, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and market share.\nThe global semiconductor market in general, and the broadband, wired and wireless infrastructure, and broader industrial and communications analog and mixed-signal markets in particular, are highly competitive. We compete in different target markets to various degrees on the basis of a number of principal competitive factors, including our products’ performance, features and functionality, energy efficiency, size, ease of system design, customer support, product roadmap, reputation, reliability and price. We expect competition to increase and intensify as a result of industry consolidation and the resulting creation of larger semiconductor companies. Large semiconductor companies resulting from industry consolidation could enjoy substantial market power, which they could exert through, among other things, aggressive pricing that could adversely affect our customer relationships, revenues, margins and profitability. In addition, we expect the internal resources of large, integrated OEMs may continue to enter our markets. Increased competition has resulted in price pressure, decreased demand, reduced revenue and profitability, and loss of market share, any of which could in the future materially and adversely affect our business, revenue, revenue growth rates, if any, and operating results.\nAs our products are integrated into a variety of communications and industrial platforms, our competitors range from large, international merchant semiconductor companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets, to internal or vertically integrated engineering groups within certain of our customers. Our primary merchant semiconductor competitors include Broadcom Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, Realtek Semiconductor Corp., Skyworks Solutions, Inc., Credo Semiconductor Inc., MediaTek, Inc., Marvell Technology Group Ltd., MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated, Analog Devices, Inc., Renesas Electronics Corporation, Microchip Technology Inc. and Semtech Corporation. It is quite likely that competition in the markets in which we participate will increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings. In addition, other companies are in the process of developing competing products for our current and target markets. Because our products often are building block semiconductors which provide functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex integrated circuits, we also face competition from manufacturers of integrated circuits, some of which may be existing customers or platform partners that develop their own integrated circuit products. If we cannot offer an attractive solution for applications where our competitors offer more fully integrated products, we may lose significant market share to our competitors. Some of our targeted customers for our high speed interconnect solutions are module makers who are vertically integrated, where we compete with internally \nTable of Contents\n\nsupplied components, and we compete with much larger analog and mixed-signal catalog competitors in the multi-market high-performance analog markets.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of semiconductors reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources with which to withstand similar adverse economic or market conditions in the future. Moreover, the competitive landscape is changing as a result of intense consolidation within our industry as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, and other competitors have begun to collaborate with each other, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape. In addition, changes in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, as well as actions by government agencies, could limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers and adversely affect our ability to compete successfully. These developments may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets. See the risk factors “We also are subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflicts” and “We will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or technology related to the development or production of our products or if such authorizations are revoked, and we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations” below.\nGlobal economic conditions, including factors such as high inflation or a potential recession, could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInflation and uncertainty in customer demand and the worldwide economy has continued, and we have experienced and could continue to experience volatility in our sales and revenues in the future. Inventory oversupply could potentially lead to more inventory write-downs, including charges for any excess or obsolete inventory which could negatively impact our gross margins. Our products are incorporated in numerous consumer devices, and demand for such products is ultimately driven by consumer demand for products such as televisions, personal computers, automobiles, and cable modems. Many of these purchases are discretionary. Global economic volatility and economic volatility in the specific markets in which the devices that incorporate our products are ultimately sold, including the impacts of inflation and a potential recession, can cause extreme difficulties for our customers and third-party vendors in accurately forecasting and planning future business activities. If banks and financial institutions with whom we have banking relationships enter receivership or become insolvent in the future, we may be unable to access, and we may lose, some or all of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to the extent those funds are not insured or otherwise protected by the FDIC. This unpredictability has and could continue to cause our customers to delay or reduce their capital expenditures and spending on our products, which delays and lengthens sales cycles and negatively affects the overall demand for our products. Worsening economic instability could continue to result in a cancellation of such orders or otherwise adversely affect spending for information technology and limit our ability to forecast future demand for our products, which could reduce expected revenues or result in a write-down of any excess or obsolete inventory. Furthermore, during inflationary economic times, our customers may face challenges in gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us. These events, together with economic volatility that may face the broader economy and, in particular, the semiconductor and communications industries, may adversely affect, our business, particularly to the extent that consumers decrease their discretionary spending for devices deploying our products. However, the magnitude of such volatility on our business and its duration is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nOther areas of our business which could be disrupted or subject to negative impacts of negative global economic conditions may include, but may not be limited to, the following: \n•Reduced ability to accurately predict our future revenue and budget future expenses;\n•Inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in design win, product development, production and fulfillment;\n•Accounts receivable collection issues should any of our limited and significant customers experience liquidity concerns;\n•Material impacts to the value of our common stock, which may result in impairment of our goodwill;\n•Material impairment of our assets, if recoverability thereof becomes a concern; and\nTable of Contents\n\n•Decreased availability of capital or access thereto in the United States and from other jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. The current macroeconomic factors affecting customer demand has been aggravated by certain factors such as high interest rates and excess channel inventory, and has resulted in, and any future downturns may result in, diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of our average selling prices. Furthermore, any future upturn in the semiconductor industry could result in increased competition for access to third-party foundry and assembly capacity. We are dependent on the availability of this capacity to manufacture and assemble all of our products. None of our third-party foundry or assembly contractors has provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us in the future. A significant downturn or upturn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nA significant variance in our operating results or rates of growth, if any, could continue to lead to substantial volatility in our stock price. Our revenue has declined, and we may not sustain our current level of revenue, which has declined, and/or manage future growth effectively. The impact of excess inventory in the channel has continued to influence our customers’ expected demand for certain of our products and negatively impact our revenue.\nOur net revenue decreased from $693.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 to $360.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 and the decline in net revenue could continue in future periods. Among other factors, the decrease is as a result of macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand; for example, the broadband market which has experienced slower than expected recovery. Prior to 2023, our net revenues grew to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. We currently expect that revenue will fluctuate in the future, from period-to-period, consistent with the cyclical nature of our industry, and we could experience further decline in revenue in the future due to current macroeconomic conditions impacting customer demand for various products. Further, the impact of excess inventory in the channel has continued to influence our customers’ expected demand for some of our products and negatively affected our revenue.\nIn addition, in July 2024, we initiated the 2024 Workforce Reduction, which we completed in 2024. Also, in the first half of 2024, we completed notifications to remaining affected employees regarding the 2023 Workforce Reductions. We may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits, savings and improvements from the reductions of our workforce if our revenue continues to decline. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from reductions of our workforce, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nYou should not rely on our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance. Please refer to the Risk Factor entitled “Our revenue and operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price” for a discussion of factors contributing to variances in our operating results or rates of growth, if any. If we are unable to resume adequate revenue growth and manage our operating expenses, our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline.\nTo manage any future growth successfully, we believe we must effectively, among other things:\n•successfully develop new products and penetrate new applications and markets;\n•recruit, hire, train and manage additional qualified engineers for our research and development activities, especially in the positions of design engineering, product and test engineering and applications engineering;\n•implement and improve our administrative, financial and operational systems, procedures and controls; and\n•enhance our information technology support for enterprise resource planning and design engineering by adapting and expanding our systems and tool capabilities, and properly training new hires as to their use.\nIf we are unable to resume and manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new products and we may fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain product quality, execute our business plan, or respond to competitive pressures.\nTable of Contents\n\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could continue to be adversely affected by military conflicts, geopolitical and economic tensions among or with countries in which we conduct business, including between the United States and China, Israel (and its conflicts with Iran and Lebanon), and among other countries. For example, as more entities are added to restricted export control lists, or as semiconductor technology exports to other countries are further controlled, our need to seek authorization from the U.S. government may impact our ability to do business.\nWe sell our products throughout the world. Products shipped to Asia accounted for 75% of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, approximately 76% of our employees are located outside of the United States. The majority of our products are manufactured, assembled and tested in Asia, and our major distributors are located in Asia. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include:\n•changes in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions;\n•geopolitical conflicts and tensions, especially between the United States and China, that could destabilize trading relationships and economic activity;\n•restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures, including export controls and restrictions, duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs;\n•disruptions of capital and trading markets;\n•changes in import and/or export control restrictions and regulations by governments, such as changes to licensing requirements or other anti-diversion enforcement measures, as a result of ongoing armed conflict and geopolitical tensions among the United States, China, Russia, Ukraine, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, and other countries;\n•transportation delays;\n•civil disturbances or political instability;\n•other unpredictable geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups, including the current conflict in Israel and continued escalation of Israel's conflicts with Iran and Lebanon;\n•differing employment practices and labor standards;\n•limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n•local business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices;\n•nationalization and expropriation;\n•changes in tax laws;\n•public health emergencies, such as another outbreak of COVID-19 or other communicable disease;\n•currency fluctuations relating to our international operating activities; and\n•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support.\nIn addition to a significant portion of our wafer supply coming from Taiwan, Singapore, China and South Korea, substantially all of our products undergo packaging and final testing in Taiwan, Singapore, China, South Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand. Any conflict or uncertainty in these countries, including due to geopolitical conditions, natural disasters, public health or safety concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the government of any country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards for products manufactured in or imported into their country that are not widely shared, it may lead some of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also are subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflicts. \nTable of Contents\n\nOur business has been impacted and may continue to be impacted by geopolitical conditions such as international trade wars (including between the United States and China), the military conflict in Israel, including the escalation in its conflicts with Iran and Lebanon, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and increased political tensions in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Currently, significant uncertainty surrounds the future trade relationships among the United States, China, and Russia. The U.S. government continues to make significant changes in U.S. trade policies that could negatively affect our business, and there may be further changes in U.S. trade policy because of the new U.S. presidential administration. Additionally, policies made by other countries, such as China and Russia or their allies, could also negatively impact our business. In a number of cases, compliance with these policies has required us to take actions adverse to our business.\nBeginning in May 2019, we ceased normal business operations with entities affiliated with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., and certain other entities following an amendment to the EAR which added these entities to the Entity List for acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy of the United States. We obtained export licenses for certain transactions with these entities. As noted above, such export licenses can be revoked or BIS could choose not to renew such licenses and we have been required by BIS to pause, delay or halt licensed activities under such licenses at certain times and could continue to do so in the future, which negatively impacts our revenue. Also, as described in more detail in the risk factor, “We will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or technology related to the development or production of our products or if such authorizations are revoked, and we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations”, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, was added to the BIS Entity list in December 2020.\nIn September 2020, we further restricted business operations with additional entities affiliated with Huawei when the BIS again amended the EAR to add such entities to the Entity List. \nSince October 2022, the United States government has taken steps to restrict the export of certain advanced semiconductor products and technology to the People’s Republic of China and/or certain companies located in China due to national security and human rights concerns. In October 2022, BIS announced additional restrictions on products and/or technology destined for use in the People’s Republic of China, including additional export controls and/or requirements on (1) certain advanced computing integrated circuits, computer commodities that contain such integrated circuits and certain semiconductor manufacturing items; (2) products and/or technologies that may be destined for facilities capable of producing certain advanced node integrated circuits; and (3) transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end uses. In October 2023, BIS announced additional restrictions on the export of certain advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing technology to China, primarily focused on integrated circuits with military, data center, or artificial intelligence applications. Pursuant to those October 2023 export control amendments, various categories of integrated circuits are now subject to export licensing and export control restrictions for export or reexport to China and certain other countries. We have confirmed that some of our products are subject to these new controls. BIS also announced restrictions on exports to (1) companies headquartered in China or whose ultimate parent company is headquartered in China or Macau, and (2) end users in certain countries of concern, in order to prevent diversion of controlled products or technology to China. In 2024, BIS announced new control criteria for integrated circuits and will be instituting additional restrictions on provision of those controlled items starting in April 2025. The United States government has also continued to add Chinese entities to the Entity List. We regularly monitor changes to applicable export control regulations to assess the impact to our business, if any. To date, none of our material customers located in China has been added to the Entity List or other restricted party list.\nThe BIS continues to add many new entities to the Entity List and Unverified List. As noted above and in the risk factor, “Changes in trade policies among the United States and other countries, in particular the imposition of new or higher tariffs could place pressure on our average selling prices as our customers seek to offset the impact of increased tariffs on their own products. Increased tariffs or the imposition of other barriers to international trade could decrease demand and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results” below, our ability to manufacture, sell or distribute products or technology will be limited if BIS further amends the EAR to add restrictions against parties who are or may be our customers. \nWe are required to obtain special licenses to conduct business with entities on the Entity List and to conduct additional diligence and recordkeeping, including obtaining user statements from entities on the Unverified List. Failure to obtain any required license would likely result in a loss of business and a corresponding negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, which products may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by other countries in \nTable of Contents\n\nretaliation. In addition, there may be further changes in U.S. trade policy given the new U.S. presidential administration. In response to the United States tightening export controls on China, China has instituted restrictions of its own that affect U.S. companies and may impact us and related entities. We have experienced and are continuing to experience weakening demand in China, and such future developments related to U.S.-China relations may also have further impact on our supply chain. Additionally, the geopolitical developments in relations between Taiwan and China could affect the supply of our products from Taiwan, including from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited, or TSMC. Such developments could include restriction on the export of products from Taiwan to China and/or restriction on the import of Taiwanese-origin products into China. \nWe believe direct impacts of the U.S. and European economic sanctions against Russia and the military conflict in Ukraine are currently limited to volatility in the prices of metals used by our outsourced semiconductor assembly and test, or OSAT, supply chain, in particular around the supply of palladium, for which Russia is the top producer in the world, as well as increased fuel costs, which has global impact on transportation costs, including the shipping and delivery of our products. However, the magnitude of such price volatility on our business and its duration is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We currently do not sell product in Russia, or sell product to distributors for resale in Russia.\nThe ongoing military conflict in Israel and Gaza, and the recent escalation in Israel’s conflicts with Iran and Lebanon, have resulted in our employees located in Israel having to perform military service and/or being negatively impacted by violence or political instability, which could interrupt business and increase costs associated with relocating employees, engaging with alternative third-party contractors or hiring additional employees outside of Israel. The United States has also imposed additional sanctions on Iran in response to attacks on Israel by Iran. As the conflict and its escalation continues, we cannot provide assurances that our business will not be impacted in the future.\nWe cannot provide assurances that we will not face disruptions of distribution arrangements in the future, including through the imposition of governmental prohibitions on selling our products to particular customers, further sanctions on Russia or other countries, and/or increases in costs of certain raw materials and transportation that will also adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Loss of a key distributor or customer under similar circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues and operating results.\nChanges in trade policies among the United States and other countries, in particular the imposition of new or higher tariffs, could place pressure on our average selling prices as our customers seek to offset the impact of increased tariffs on their own products. Increased tariffs or the imposition of other barriers to international trade could decrease demand and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\nThe United States has imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on certain products exported by a number of U.S. trading partners, including China, Europe, Canada, and Mexico. In response, many of those trading partners, including China, have imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on American products. We have experienced and are continuing to experience weakening demand in China, and continuing changes in government trade policies create a heightened risk of further increased tariffs that impose barriers to international trade and could further decrease international demand. Our business and operating results are substantially dependent on international trade. Many of our manufacturers sell products incorporating our integrated circuits into international markets.\nTariffs on our customers’ products may adversely affect our gross profit margins in the future due to the potential for increased pressure on our selling prices by customers seeking to offset the impact of tariffs on their own products. In addition, tariffs could make our OEM and ODM customers’ products less attractive relative to products offered by their competitors, which may not be subject to similar tariffs. Some OEM and ODMs in our industry have already implemented short-term price adjustments to offset such tariffs and transitioned their production and supply chain to locations outside of China. We believe that increases in tariffs on imported goods or the failure to resolve current international trade disputes could further decrease demand and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nFurthermore, compliance with export controls and implementation of additional tariffs may increase compliance costs and further affect our business and operating results.\nTable of Contents\n\nWe will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or technology related to the development or production of our products or if such authorizations are revoked, and we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations.\nCertain of our products and technologies are subject to export and/or import controls imposed by countries in which we do business, including the United States Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, administered by BIS. Certain of our products and technologies are subject to the EAR, which may require a license authorization from BIS prior to the shipment or sharing of certain products and technologies with certain end users or destinations. Such approval may be delayed, denied, or even revoked after initially being granted by BIS, depending on one or more factors including the type of product or technology at issue, the intended end use, the identity of the end user, the identity of other companies involved in the production process, and whether a license exception might apply, among others. We are subject to similar export controls regulations in other jurisdictions where we operate, including the European Union, Singapore, and Taiwan, among others.\nExport control laws, regulations, and orders are complex, change frequently and with limited or no notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified as U.S.-China geopolitical tensions worsen. Since October 2022, the United States has announced export control restrictions on a number of entities based in China due to national security and human rights concerns and additional more severe restrictions may be possible. The addition of new entities to restricted party lists can further increase the scope of export restrictions applicable to our business. The United States has also announced measures intended to further restrict the export of certain advanced semiconductor products and technology, as well as products that incorporate those advanced semiconductor products, to the People’s Republic of China, or China, and/or certain companies located in China due to national security and human rights concerns, including the imposition of new license requirements for certain semiconductor technologies. Additional restrictions related to advanced semiconductor products and computing resources were released in January 2025 and go into effect later this year. Failure to obtain required export licenses for our products or the placement of one or more of our customers on any restricted parties lists could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business.\nObtaining export licenses can be difficult, costly and time-consuming and we may not always be successful in obtaining necessary export licenses due to reasons beyond our control. Our inability to obtain required import or export approval for our products may adversely affect our business, and other limitations imposed on our ability to export or sell our products may also harm our international and domestic revenue. In addition, it is possible that BIS can revoke licenses that have been granted or decline to re-issue such licenses upon their expiration or in the event modifications are required to a previously-issued license. Although our policies, procedures, and controls are designed to detect and prevent potential violations and maintain ongoing compliance with applicable export controls laws, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations. For example, our products could be diverted to bad actors by third parties. In addition, if our customers or business partners fail to comply with applicable regulations and laws or to timely notify us of material changes to the licenses, we may be subject to liability and may be required to suspend sales or take other action which could damage our reputation and negatively impact our results of operations. If we violate or fail to comply with any of these requirements, a range of consequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. The absence of comparable restrictions imposed on competitors based in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position.\nTo the extent that we do business with parties on the Entity List under approved export licenses, our business could be affected if the government delays, denies, or otherwise does not grant, amend, or renew required licenses. We currently have licenses from BIS that permit certain of our transactions with two restricted parties, but those licenses may be revoked at any time or denied for renewal when the license expires. One of our third-party foundry partners, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, was added to the BIS Entity list in December 2020. As a result of that Entity List listing, we have been required to obtain export licenses from BIS for the export or reexport to SMIC of any technology for the development or production (fabrication) of our products. Although we have obtained export licenses in order to have SMIC manufacture certain products for us, those export licenses could be revoked at any time. Revocation of any of those export licenses could significantly disrupt our ability to obtain the products in question and fulfill customer requirements. Moreover, the issuance of export licenses for other technology transfers to SMIC is a matter of discretion with the U.S. government, and it is uncertain whether we will be able to obtain export licenses, in a timely manner, for the transfer of technology required by SMIC to produce semiconductor wafers for us. If we are unable to obtain those export licenses, it may be necessary to have the products fabricated by other semiconductor foundries, which may be more costly alternatives to SMIC, and which may have limited capacity to fabricate sufficient products to meet our requirements.\nAdditionally, current and future business with parties subject to significant export restrictions, including those named on the Entity List may be limited in scope or suspended entirely in order to comply with the EAR or other applicable laws or \nTable of Contents\n\nregulations and, as a result, our revenue could be adversely impacted until a license is granted or renewed. It is possible that the U.S. government may not grant licenses or renew licenses to transact business with entities on the Entity List.\nIn September 2022, we self-identified a potential violation of the EAR related to certain transactions with one of our foundry partners in China on the Entity List in which limited technology was furnished to our Specific Foundry Partner without authorization under the EAR. Upon discovery, we took immediate action to remediate, including by implementing additional measures to prevent recurrence. Our Audit Committee engaged outside counsel to conduct a privileged investigation. On March 3, 2023, we submitted a comprehensive voluntary self-disclosure to BIS regarding the potential EAR violation described above and other potential export control violations. On June 8, 2023, BIS closed out its review of our voluntary self-disclosure without monetary or other penalties and with the issuance of a “warning letter.”\nWe also are subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflicts. \nOur business has been impacted and may continue to be impacted by geopolitical conditions such as international trade wars (including between the United States and China), the military conflict in Israel and Gaza, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and increased political tensions in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Currently, significant uncertainty surrounds the future trade relationships among the United States, China, and Russia. The U.S. government continues to make significant changes in U.S. trade policies that could negatively affect our business. Additionally, policies made by other countries, such as China and Russia or their allies, could also negatively impact our business. In a number of cases, compliance with these policies has required us to take actions adverse to our business.\nBeginning in May 2019, we ceased normal business operations with entities affiliated with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., and certain other entities following an amendment to the EAR which added these entities to the Entity List for acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy of the United States. We obtained export licenses for certain transactions with these entities. As noted above, export licenses can be revoked or BIS could choose not to renew such licenses, which would halt the currently-approved licensed activities.\nIn September 2020, we further restricted business operations with additional entities affiliated with Huawei when the BIS again amended the EAR to add such entities to the Entity List. \nSince October 2022, the United States government has taken steps to restrict the export of certain advanced semiconductor products and technology to the People’s Republic of China and/or certain companies located in China due to national security and human rights concerns. In October 2022, BIS announced additional restrictions on products and/or technology destined for use in the People’s Republic of China, including additional export controls and/or requirements on (1) certain advanced computing integrated circuits, computer commodities that contain such integrated circuits and certain semiconductor manufacturing items; (2) products and/or technologies that may be destined for facilities capable of producing certain advanced node integrated circuits; and (3) transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end uses. In October 2023, BIS announced additional restrictions on the export of certain advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing technology to China, primarily focused on integrated circuits with military, data center, or artificial intelligence applications. Pursuant to those October 2023 export control amendments, various categories of integrated circuits are now subject to export licensing and export control restrictions for export or reexport to China and certain other countries. We have confirmed that some of our products are subject to these new controls. BIS also announced restrictions on exports to (1) companies headquartered in China or Macau, and (2) end users in certain countries of concern, in order to prevent diversion of controlled products or technology to China. The United States government has also continued to add Chinese entities to the Entity List. We regularly monitor changes to applicable export control regulations to assess the impact to our business, if any. To date, none of our material customers located in China has been added to the Entity List or other restricted party list.\nThe BIS continues to add many new entities to the Entity List and Unverified List. As noted above, our ability to sell or distribute products or technology will be limited if BIS further amends the EAR to add restrictions against parties who are or may be our customers. \nWe are required to obtain special licenses to conduct business with entities on the Entity List and to conduct additional diligence and recordkeeping, including obtaining user statements from entities on the Unverified List. Failure to obtain any required license would likely result in a loss of business and a corresponding negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nTable of Contents\n\nWe cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken with respect to trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, which products may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. In response to the United States tightening export controls on China, China has instituted restrictions of its own that affect U.S. companies and may impact us and related entities. We have experienced and are continuing to experience weakening demand in China, and such future developments related to U.S.-China relations may also have an impact on our supply chain. Additionally, the geopolitical developments in relations between Taiwan and China could affect the supply of our products from Taiwan, including from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited, or TSMC.\nWe believe direct impacts of the economic sanctions against Russia and the military conflict in Ukraine are currently limited to volatility in the prices of metals used by our outsourced semiconductor assembly and test, or OSAT, supply chain, in particular around the supply of palladium, for which Russia is the top producer in the world, as well as increased fuel costs, which has global impact on transportation costs, including the shipping and delivery of our products. However, the magnitude of such price volatility on our business and its duration is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We currently do not sell product in Russia, or sell product to distributors for resale in Russia.\nThe ongoing military conflict in Israel has resulted in our employees located in Israel having to perform military service and/or being negatively impacted by violence or political instability, which could interrupt business and increase costs associated with relocating employees, engaging with alternative third-party contractors or hiring additional employees outside of Israel. As the conflict continues, we cannot provide assurances that our business will not be impacted in the future.\nWe cannot provide assurances that we will not face disruptions of distribution arrangements in the future, including through the imposition of governmental prohibitions on selling our products to particular customers, further sanctions on Russia or other countries, and/or increases in costs of certain raw materials and transportation that will also adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Loss of a key distributor or customer under similar circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues and operating results. \nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, one or more of our major customers has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nOur customers primarily include electronics distributors, module makers, OEMs and ODMs, which incorporate our products in a wide range of electronic devices. Revenue is also generated from sales of intellectual property and consideration under intellectual property agreements. The recipients of such intellectual property are also referred to as the Company’s customers. In the year ended December 31, 2024, one customer accounted for 12% of our net revenue, and our ten largest customers collectively accounted for 60% of our net revenue, of which distributor customers accounted for 30% of our net revenue. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we experienced a decrease in customer demand, and consequently a reduction in orders, primarily due to macroeconomic factors, including slower than expected recovery in sales and excess inventory in the channel following the industry-wide supply shortage in 2021 and 2022. Such factors may continue to hamper significant recovery of our revenues and diminish our efforts to return to growth in our revenues. We expect that our operating results for the foreseeable future will continue to show a substantial percentage of sales dependent on a relatively small number of customers. In the future, these customers may decide, as they have at times before, not to purchase our products at all, may purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or may defer or cancel purchases or otherwise alter their purchasing patterns. While we are entitled to consideration under intellectual property sales agreements, which consideration has been and could be material, we may not receive such consideration in the future. Factors that could affect our revenue from these large customers include the following:\n•macroeconomic and business factors influencing such customers’ demand for our products, including excess inventory in the channel;\n•substantially all of our sales to date have been made on a purchase order basis, and we do not have long-term product purchase commitments with our customers;\n•some of our customers have sought or are seeking relationships with current or potential competitors which may affect their purchasing decisions; \n•service provider and OEM consolidation across cable, satellite, and fiber markets could result in significant changes to our customers’ technology development and deployment priorities and roadmaps, which could affect our ability to forecast demand accurately and could lead to increased volatility in our business;\nTable of Contents\n\n•technological changes in our markets could lead to substantial volatility in our revenues based on product transitions, and particularly in our broadband markets, we face risks based on changes in the way consumers are accessing and using broadband and cable services, which would affect operator demand for our products; and\n•any decrease in revenue generated by the recipient of intellectual property under certain intellectual property sale agreements, including due to any inability to enforce our intellectual property rights as described in the section “Risks Relating to Intellectual Property” under the risk factor “We utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.”\nIn addition, delays in development could impair our relationships with our strategic customers and negatively impact sales of the products under development. Moreover, it is possible that our customers may develop their own products or adopt a competitor’s solution for products that they currently buy from us. When this occurs, our sales could decline and/or our market share could be reduced.\nOur relationship with customers has been and could continue to be impaired by our sale of patents. For example, our customers are and could be subject to patent infringement based on patents we divested to the extent that our customers also source components from our competitors, such as those referenced in Part I, Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) of this report.\nOur relationships with some customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products. To attract new customers or retain existing customers, we sometimes offer customers favorable prices on our products which results in a decline in our average selling prices and, if material, a decline in our gross margins. The loss of a key customer, a reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could seriously impact our revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues are from sales of product to distributors, who then resell our product. Our agreements with certain of these distributors provide protection against price reduction on their inventories of our products. The loss of certain distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and price reductions associated with their inventories of our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the event of a dramatic decline in selling prices for these products.\nIn addition, the current situation relating to trade with China and governmental and regulatory concerns relating to specific Chinese companies continue to remain fluid and unpredictable. Products shipped to mainland China accounted for less than 10% of our net revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 11% during the year ended December 31, 2023. Our current and future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by limitations on our ability to sell to one or more Chinese customers, as described in the section “Risks Related to Our Business” under the risk factors “We are also subject to risks associated with international geopolitical and military conflict” and “We will lose sales if we are unable to obtain or retain government authorization to export certain of our products or technology related to the development or production of our products or if such authorization are revoked, and we will be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations”, and by tariffs and other trade barriers that have or may be implemented by governmental authorities.\nAny legal proceedings or claims against us or potential violations of applicable regulations could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could harm our reputation regardless of the outcome.\nIn addition to the legal proceedings referenced in Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings of this report, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and/or inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property, product liability, employment, class action, customer claims, whistleblower and other litigation claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings regarding potential violations of applicable law, and we may not be successful in resolving such proceedings or inquiries. In addition, we have implemented reductions in force and the attendant layoffs has resulted and could result in the risk of claims being made by or on behalf of affected employees. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability, or require us to change our business practices. In addition, the expense of litigation or responding to inquiries and the timing of such expenses from period to period are difficult to estimate, subject to change, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of the potential risks, expenses, and uncertainties of litigation or government proceedings, we may, from time to time, resolve disputes, even where we have meritorious claims or defenses, by agreeing to settlement agreements. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTable of Contents\n\nWe may in the future be subject to information technology failures, including security breaches, cyber-attacks, design defects or system failures, that could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.\nWe rely on our information technology systems for the effective operation of our business and for the secure maintenance and storage of confidential data relating to our business and third-party businesses. Security threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against or implement adequate preventive measures. We experience cyber-attacks of varying degrees on our technology infrastructure and systems and notwithstanding our defensive measures, experienced programmers, hackers, state actors, or others may be able to penetrate our security controls through attacks such as phishing, impersonating authorized users, ransomware, viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, software supply chain attacks, exploitation of design flaws, bugs and other security weaknesses and vulnerabilities, covert introduction of malware to computers and networks, including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect, or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event or that may continue undetected for an extended period of time. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create heightened risk of cyber-attacks and attackers have used artificial intelligence and machine learning to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks against targets. Our information technology infrastructure also includes products and services provided by third parties, and these providers can experience breaches of their systems and products, or provide inadequate updates or support, which can impact the security of our systems and our proprietary or confidential information.\nA cybersecurity incident or other compromise of our information technology systems could result in unauthorized publication or misuse of confidential business or proprietary information belonging to us, a customer, supplier, employee or other third party, including personal data, result in violations of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation, cause us to incur direct losses if attackers initiate wire transfers or access our bank or investment accounts, or damage our reputation. More generally, any theft, loss, misuse, or other unauthorized processing of any confidential business or proprietary information, including personal data, collected, used, stored, transferred, or otherwise processed by us or on our behalf could result in significantly increased costs, expenses, damage to our reputation, and claims, litigation, demands, and regulatory investigations or other proceedings. The cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures either as a response to specific breaches or incidents or as a result of evolving risks could be significant. In addition, our inability to use or access our information systems at critical points in time could adversely affect the timely and efficient operation of our business. Any delayed sales, significant costs or lost customers resulting from these technology failures could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results. We also may face difficulties or delays in identifying and remediating and otherwise responding to any security breach or incident.\nFrom time-to-time, we upgrade software that we use in our business, including our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Our business may be disrupted if our software does not work as planned or if we experience issues relating to any implementation, or accessing our software as has happened in a previous cybersecurity attack, in which case we may be unable to timely or accurately prepare financial reports, make payments to our suppliers and employees, or ship to, invoice and collect from our customers.\nWe may be subject to supply chain attacks where threat actors attempt to inject malicious code into our products thus infecting our products and the systems of our customers. Any such supply chain attack could have magnified damages to our business as a direct result of the attack as well as due to a loss of credibility or reputation with our customers. Such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication, and if successful, expose us and the affected parties to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruptions of our business operations, including our manufacturing operations.\nThird parties with which we conduct business, such as foundries, assembly and test contractors, and distributors, have access to certain portions of our sensitive data, and we rely on third parties to store and otherwise process data for us. We are dependent on the information security systems of these third parties and they face substantial security risks similar to those outlined above. Any security breaches or incidents or other unauthorized access by third parties to the systems of our suppliers, service providers, or other third parties with access to our sensitive data, or the existence of computer viruses, ransomware or other malicious code in their data, software, or hardware, could result in disruptions or failures of systems used in our business, payments to fraudulent bank accounts, and expose us to a risk of loss, misappropriation, unavailability and other unauthorized processing of information. Any of the foregoing, or the perception any of them has occurred, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial results.\nAdditionally, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate or otherwise protect us with respect to claims, expenses, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, litigation, regulatory actions, or other impacts arising from any of the \nTable of Contents\n\nsecurity breaches or incidents outlined above, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any of these results could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results, potentially in a material manner.\nAverage selling prices of our products have previously decreased and could decrease in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and gross margins.\nWe have and may in the future experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in our operating results due to erosion of our average selling prices. From time to time, we have reduced the average unit price of our products due to competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or our competitors, and for other reasons, and we expect that we will have to do so again in the future. In particular, we believe that industry consolidation has provided a number of larger semiconductor companies with substantial market power, which has had a material adverse impact on selling prices in some of our markets. If we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or introducing new products with higher margins, our revenue and gross margins will suffer. To support our gross margins, we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continually reduce our and our customers’ costs. Our inability to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline. In addition, under certain of our agreements with key distributors, we provide protection for reductions in selling prices of the distributors’ inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results if the selling prices for those products fell dramatically. \nIf we fail to penetrate new applications and markets, our revenue, revenue growth rate, if any, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe sell a significant portion of our products to manufacturers of cable broadband voice and data modems and gateways, satellite outdoor units, optical modules for long-haul and metro telecommunications markets, and RF transceivers and modem solutions for wireless infrastructure markets. Our product offerings also include broadband data access, power management and interface technologies which are ubiquitous functions in new and existing markets such as wireless and wireline communications infrastructure, broadband access, industrial, enterprise network, and automotive applications. We have further expanded our product offerings to include Wi-Fi, ethernet and broadband gateway processor SoCs and intellectual property that utilizes patented machine learning techniques to improve signal integrity and power efficiency in SoCs, ASICs, and field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, used in next-generation communication and artificial intelligence systems. Our future revenue growth, if any, will depend in part on our ability to further penetrate into, and expand beyond, these markets with analog, digital and mixed-signal solutions targeting the markets for Wi-Fi and broadband, high-speed interconnects for data center, metro, and long-haul optical modules, and telecommunications wireless infrastructure products. Each of these markets presents distinct and substantial risks. If any of these markets do not develop as we currently anticipate, or if we are unable to penetrate them successfully, it could materially and adversely affect our revenue and revenue growth rate, if any.\nBroadband data modems and gateways and video gateways continue to represent a significant North American and European revenue generator. The North American and European Pay-TV market is dominated by a few OEMs, including Vantiva SA, Commscope Holding Company, Inc., Hitron Technologies Inc., Compal Broadband Networks, Inc., Humax Co., Ltd., and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. These OEMs are large multinational corporations with negotiating power relative to us and are undergoing significant consolidation. Securing design wins with any of these companies requires a substantial investment of our time and resources. Even if we succeed, additional testing and operational certifications will be required by the OEMs’ customers, which include large Pay-TV television companies such as Comcast Corporation, Liberty Global plc, Charter Communications, Inc., Sky UK Limited, AT&T Inc. and EchoStar Corporation. In addition, our products will need to be compatible with other components in our customers’ designs, including components produced by our competitors or potential competitors. There can be no assurance that these other companies will support or continue to support our products.\nIf we fail to penetrate these or other new markets upon which we target our resources, our revenue and revenue growth rate, if any, likely will decrease over time and our financial condition could suffer.\nTable of Contents\n\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to demand for our products in markets for broadband solutions, and development delays and consolidation trends among cable and satellite Pay-TV and broadband operators has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect our future revenues and operating results.\n For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, revenue directly attributable to broadband applications accounted for approximately 32% and 29% of our net revenue, respectively. We have experienced a decrease in broadband net revenue of $86.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, and negative impact to our revenues could continue in 2025 due to slower than expected recovery in this market. Delays in the development of, or unexpected developments in, the broadband markets, including international macroeconomic headwinds, has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on order activity by OEMs in these markets for 2025 and, as a result, on our business, revenue, operating results and financial condition. In addition, consolidation trends among Pay-TV and broadband operators may continue, which could delay or lead to cancellations of major spending programs and have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to make the substantial and productive research and development investments that are required to remain competitive in our business.\nThe semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products. Many of our products originated with our research and development efforts, which we believe have provided us with a significant competitive advantage. For year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our research and development expense was $225.2 million, $269.5 million, and $296.4 million, respectively. While we have decreased our research and development spending, including via our Workforce Reductions, to meet evolving demand, we expect our research and development expenses to increase in future years when we return to expanding our product portfolio and enhancing existing products. We monitor such expenditures as part of our strategy of devoting focused research and development efforts on the development of innovative and sustainable product platforms. We are committed to investing in new product development internally in order to stay competitive in our markets and plan to maintain research and development and design capabilities for new solutions in advanced semiconductor process nodes such as 16nm and 5nm and beyond, as well as to address challenges of capturing and processing high quality broadband communications and high-speed optical interconnect signals. However, we do not know whether we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development required to remain competitive as semiconductor process nodes continue to shrink and become increasingly complex. In addition, we cannot assure you that the technologies that are the focus of our research and development expenditures will become commercially successful. Furthermore, we currently receive grants from certain non-U.S. governments, but those grants and any future grants may not be available to us in the future.\nThe complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses caused by undetected defects or bugs, which could reduce the market acceptance of our new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers and adversely affect our operating costs.\nHighly complex products like our Wi-Fi and broadband RF receivers and RF receiver SoCs, physical medium devices for optical modules, RF transceiver and modem solutions for wireless infrastructure markets, and high-performance analog solutions may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. Where any of our products, including legacy acquired products, contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may not be able to successfully correct these problems. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers, and our financial results. In addition, these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers. If any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs, and our operating costs could be adversely affected. These problems may also result in warranty or product liability claims against us by our customers or others that may require us to make significant expenditures to defend these claims or pay damage awards. In the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we compensate the affected customer. We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance is limited in amount and subject to significant deductibles. There is no guarantee that our insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all claims. We also may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one of our customers’ products containing one of our devices. The process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources, and we may incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm. Costs or payments made in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations, and ability to obtain future coverage. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, any uninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results. Although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, if a \nTable of Contents\n\ncatastrophic product liability claim were to occur, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, may not cover the claims, and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur revenue and operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. For example, our revenue declined from $693.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $360.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and on an annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n•seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets;\n•overall demand volatility for semiconductor solutions across a diverse range of communications, industrial and multi-market applications;\n•changes in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers;\n•the receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers;\n•fluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers;\n•the gain or loss of significant customers;\n•market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products;\n•our ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n•size and timing of any consideration received under our intellectual property sale agreements\n•the availability and cost of products from our suppliers;\n•the timing and extent of operating expenses, including costs related to product development and personnel compensation and benefits;\n•new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;\n•incurrence of research and development and related new product expenditures;\n•government actions, by the United States, China or other countries, that impose barriers or restrictions that would impact our ability to sell or ship products to customers;\n•currency fluctuations;\n•fluctuations in manufacturing yields of integrated circuits;\n•significant warranty claims, including those not covered by our suppliers;\n•changes in our product mix or customer mix;\n•potential indemnification claims, including those arising as a result of our contractual arrangements or intellectual property disputes;\n•intellectual property disputes;\n•timing and extent of product development costs;\n•loss of key personnel or inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified skilled workers; \n•impairment of long-lived assets, including masks and production equipment; and \n•the effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products.\nTable of Contents\n\nIf our growth rate continues to slow, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. These factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. We typically are required to incur substantial development costs in advance of a prospective sale with no certainty that we will ever recover these costs. A substantial amount of time may pass between a design win and the generation of revenue related to the expenses previously incurred, which can potentially cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales, research and development costs. Any failure to adjust spending or our operations quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify its adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired and our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence. To compete successfully, we must design, develop, market and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability and meet the cost expectations of our customers. The introduction of new products by our competitors, the market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products obsolete. Our failure to anticipate or timely develop new or enhanced products or technologies in response to technological shifts has resulted, and could in the future, result in decreased revenue and our competitors winning more competitive bid processes, known as “design wins.” In particular, we may experience difficulties with product design, manufacturing, marketing or certification that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products. If we fail or are slow to introduce new or enhanced products that meet the needs of our customers or penetrate new markets in a timely fashion, as has happened previously or in the future, we will lose market share and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn particular, we believe that we will need to develop new products in part to respond to changing dynamics and trends in our end user markets, including (among other trends) consolidation among cable and satellite operators, potential industry shifts away from the hardware devices and other technologies that incorporate certain of our products, advances in artificial intelligence, and changes in consumer television viewing habits and how consumers access and receive broadcast content and digital broadband services. We cannot predict how these trends will continue to develop or how or to what extent they may affect our future revenues and operating results. We believe that we will need to continue to make substantial investments in research and development in an attempt to ensure a product roadmap that anticipates these types of changes; however, we cannot provide any assurances that we will accurately predict the direction in which our markets will evolve or that we will be able to develop, market, or sell new products that respond to such changes successfully or in a timely manner, if at all.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and differences between our estimates of customer demand and product mix and our actual results could continue to negatively affect our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\nOur revenue is generated on the basis of shipments of products under purchase orders with our customers rather than long-term purchase commitments. In addition, our customers can and have requested to cancel purchase orders or defer the shipments of our products under certain circumstances. Our products are manufactured using a silicon foundry according to our estimates of customer demand, which requires us to make separate demand forecast assumptions for every customer, each of which may introduce significant variability into our aggregate estimate. We have limited visibility into future customer demand and the product mix that our customers will require, which has in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our revenue forecasts and operating margins. Also, as customer lead times continue to improve, we have seen and expect to continue to see a more normalized demand-planning horizon. Moreover, because our target markets are relatively new, many of our customers have difficulty accurately forecasting their product requirements and estimating the timing of their new product introductions, which ultimately affects their demand for our products. Historically, because of this limited visibility, actual results have been different from our forecasts of customer demand. Some of these differences have been material which has led to and could continue to lead to excess inventory or product shortages and revenue and margin forecasts above those we were actually able to achieve. These differences may occur in the future, and the adverse impact of these differences between forecasts and actual results could grow if we are not successful in expanding the customer base for our products. In addition, the rapid pace of innovation in our industry could render significant portions of our inventory obsolete. Excess or obsolete inventory levels has resulted and continue to result in unexpected expenses or increases in our reserves that could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we were to underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable, we could forego revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any significant future cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return \nTable of Contents\n\nof previously sold products due to manufacturing defects could materially and adversely impact our profit margins, increase our write-offs due to product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\nWe may have difficulty accurately predicting our future revenue and appropriately budgeting our expenses particularly as we seek to enter new markets where we may not have prior experience.\nOur operating history had historically focused on developing integrated circuits for specific applications and more recently, the wired whole-home broadband connectivity market and markets for wireless telecommunications infrastructure and power management and interface technologies which are ubiquitous functions in wireless and wireline communications infrastructure, broadband access, industrial, enterprise network, and automotive applications. As part of our growth strategy, we seek to expand our addressable market into new product categories. For example, we expanded into the markets for Wi-Fi, ethernet and broadband gateway processor SoCs and intellectual property that utilizes patented machine learning techniques to improve signal integrity and power efficiency in SoCs, ASICs, and FPGAs used in next-generation communication and artificial intelligence systems. Our limited operating experience in new markets such as data center markets or potential markets we may enter, combined with the rapidly evolving nature of our markets in general, substantial uncertainty concerning how these markets may develop and other factors beyond our control reduces our ability to accurately forecast quarterly or annual revenue. If our revenue does not increase particularly in new markets, we could continue to incur significant losses due to our higher expense levels if we are not able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall in current or future revenue.\nOur customers require our products and our third-party contractors to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process which does not assure product sales.\nPrior to purchasing our products, our customers require that both our products and our third-party contractors undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of the products in the customer’s system and rigorous reliability testing. This qualification process may continue for six months or more. However, qualification of a product by a customer does not assure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision to our solutions, or changes in our customer’s manufacturing process or our selection of a new supplier may require a new qualification process, which may result in delays and in us holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take six months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or devices that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualifying our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying any of our products with a customer, sales of this product to the customer may be precluded or delayed, which may result in a decrease in our revenue and cause our business to suffer.\nWinning business is subject to lengthy competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant expenditures. Even if we begin a product design, customers may decide to cancel or change their product plans, which could cause us to generate no revenue from a product and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are focused on securing design wins to develop RF receivers and RF receiver SoCs, MoCA and G.hn SoCs, DBS-ODU SoCs, physical medium devices for optical modules, interface and power management devices, and SoC solutions targeting infrastructure opportunities within the telecommunications, wireless, industrial and multi-market and Wi-Fi and broadband operator markets for use in our customers’ products. These selection processes typically are lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that some of our customers’ products likely will have short life cycles. Although this has not occurred to date, failure to obtain a design win could prevent us from offering an entire generation of a product. This could cause us to lose revenue and require us to write off obsolete inventory, and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes. After securing a design win, we may experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required. Our customers generally take a considerable amount of time to evaluate our products. The typical time from early engagement by our sales force to actual product introduction runs from nine to twelve months for the broadband and communications market, and 36 months or longer for industrial, wired and wireless infrastructure markets. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales. In addition, any delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we may have incurred significant expense and generated no revenue. Finally, our customers’ failure to successfully market and sell their products could reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition \nTable of Contents\n\nand results of operations. If we were unable to generate revenue after incurring substantial expenses to develop any of our products, our business would suffer.\nOur business is subject to various international, U.S. and state laws and governmental regulations, and compliance with these laws and regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses. A failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nOur business is subject to various laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions where we do business, including but not limited to laws, regulations and other legal requirements related to packaging; product content; labor and employment; import and customs; export controls; anti-corruption; personal and data privacy; cybersecurity; human rights; conflict minerals; environment, health and safety; competition and antitrust; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and with little or no notice, occasionally are conflicting or ambiguous, and have generally become more stringent over time. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and we may be required to incur significant costs to remedy any potential gaps or violations that are identified. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. Although our policies, procedures, and controls are designed to detect and prevent potential violations and maintain ongoing compliance with applicable laws, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such laws and regulations. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other penalties or sanctions. The costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of any investigations, remediation, auditing and monitoring) could adversely affect our current or future business.\nAs indicated elsewhere in this report, we do a substantial portion of our business in Asia, including in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China, or China. Since October 2022, the United States has taken steps to restrict the export of certain advanced semiconductor products and technology to China as well as a number of specific Chinese companies, due to national security and human rights concerns. There has also been a substantial focus by regulators in the United States and Europe on the business practices of certain major Chinese technology companies. Complying with changing export control laws may require us to develop additional policies, procedures, and controls, or incur additional costs, including in connection with the development or performance of additional due diligence in order to prevent diversion of restricted products or technology to China, Russia, or other destinations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also result in the loss of revenue. Since October 2022, we have restricted shipments and exports to certain major Chinese technology companies, including a semiconductor foundry and OSAT providers. While we intend to continue to conduct our businesses in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws relating to export controls and anti-corruption, it is possible that the nature of our business and customers could result in a review of our relationships and practices by regulatory authorities. At times, we may discover issues that we bring to the attention of the relevant government agencies, as we did on March 3, 2023, when we submitted a comprehensive voluntary self-disclosure to BIS regarding the potential EAR violation described above and other potential export control violations. Although the March 2023 voluntary self-disclosure to BIS resulted in a warning letter, we could incur increased administrative and legal costs in order to remediate any potential compliance gaps or violations, to respond to any inquiries, or in connection with the preparation and submission of any voluntary self-disclosures to the government agencies, as appropriate. Any failure to comply with applicable laws or regulatory approvals could adversely affect our business and operating results. We have implemented policies and procedures, including adoption of an anti-corruption policy and procedures with respect to applicable export control laws, but there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prove effective.\nOur products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. If we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations, our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, climate change and new or revised rules and regulations related thereto, including regulations with respect to greenhouse gas emissions and regulations enacted by the SEC and recent legislation enacted in California, may impact our business in numerous ways. Climate change and its effects could lead to further increases in raw material prices or their reduced availability due to, for example, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events and any supply chain disruptions resulting therefrom, and could cause increased incidence of disruption to the production and distribution of our products and an adverse impact on consumer demand and spending. For example, as a fabless semiconductor company, we outsource our manufacturing to countries outside of the United States, and our manufacturers’ suppliers reside in areas that are more susceptible to extreme weather impacts. If our suppliers have difficulty obtaining raw materials and natural resources due to extreme weather impacts, this could increase the cost associated with extraction of raw materials or limit the supply available \nTable of Contents\n\nfor our key suppliers to manufacture our products, driving the cost up for us and/or threaten our upstream supply chain. In recent months, there have been substantial legislative and regulatory developments on climate-related issues, including proposed, issued and implemented legislation and rule makings that would require companies to assess and/or disclose climate metrics, risks, opportunities, policies and practices. For example, on March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted rules mandating climate-related disclosures that would require increased climate change-related disclosure in our periodic reports and other filings with the SEC for fiscal year 2025 and beyond, which were stayed on April 4, 2024. The potential impact to us of these legislative and regulatory developments is uncertain at this time, although we expect that the emerging legal and regulatory requirements on climate-related issues will result in additional compliance and may require us to spend or add significant resources and divert management attention. We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully adapt our operations in response to any climate-related changes or comply with any increased reporting obligations in a cost-effective manner, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe must also conform the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, we could be required to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain qualified personnel and senior management, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could suffer.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel, including our management, sales and marketing and finance teams, and especially our design and technical staff. In the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we completed workforce reductions to align our operational needs with the changes in macroeconomic conditions and the demand environment. These workforce reductions has yielded unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reductions in workforce and reduced employee morale, which has caused a small number of our employees who were not affected by the reductions in workforce to seek alternate employment. Employees whose positions were eliminated or those who determine to seek alternate employment may seek employment with our competitors. In addition, our reductions in workforce may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy and respond rapidly to any new product, growth or revenue opportunities. Additionally, reductions in workforce may make it more difficult to recruit and retain new employees. If we need to increase the size of our workforce in the future, we may encounter a competitive hiring market due to labor shortages, increased employee turnover, changes in the availability of workers and increased wage costs. Employee litigation related to the reduction of our workforce could be costly and time-consuming. \nWe do not know whether we will be able to attract and retain the required and desirable personnel as we continue to pursue our business strategy. Historically, we have encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers because there is a limited pool of engineers with the expertise required in our field, and expect to continue facing such difficulties in seeking talent. Competition for these personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock-based compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment. We have experienced declines in the market price of our stock and reductions in force which could adversely affect our ability to attract, motivate or retain key employees. In addition, our future performance also depends on the ability of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. Our employment arrangements with our employees do not generally require that they continue to work for us for any specified period, and therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, especially our management and key design and technical personnel, or our inability to retain, attract and motivate our management and qualified design and technical and other personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success also depends on the continued contributions of our senior management team and other key personnel. None of our senior management team or other key personnel is bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period. In addition, we have not entered into non-compete agreements with members of our senior management team or other key personnel, except in limited circumstances (e.g., in connection with the acquisition of other companies). We are fortunate that certain members of our senior management team have long tenures with us, but recently we also have been required to recruit new members of senior management. With respect to recruitment and retention of senior management, we need to ensure that our compensation programs provide sufficient recruitment and retention incentives as well as incentives to achieve our long-term strategic business and financial objectives. We expect competition for individuals with our required skill sets, particularly technical and engineering skills, to remain intense even in weak global macroeconomic environments. The loss \nTable of Contents\n\nof any member of our senior management team or other key personnel could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our aggregate indebtedness was $125.0 million, and we are subject to a variable amount of interest on the principal balance of our credit agreements and could continue to be adversely impacted by high interest rates in the future. Such indebtedness adversely affects our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations and contains financial and operational covenants that could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions. In addition, high interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and service our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products and our distributors’ business. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our aggregate indebtedness was $125.0 million from an initial secured term B loan facility, or the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement also provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $100.0 million, or the Revolving Facility, which remains undrawn as of December 31, 2024. The credit agreement also permits us to request incremental loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the sum of an amount equal to the greater of (x) $175.0 million and (y) 100% of “Consolidated EBITDA” (as defined in such agreement), plus the amount of certain voluntary prepayments, plus an unlimited amount that is subject to pro forma compliance with certain first lien net leverage ratio, secured net leverage ratio and total net leverage ratio tests. The June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement was amended on June 29, 2023 to implement a benchmark replacement.\nThe Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement has a seven-year term expiring in June 2028 and bears interest at either an Adjusted Term SOFR plus a fixed applicable margin of 2.25% or an Adjusted Base Rate plus a fixed applicable margin of 1.25%, at our option. Commencing on September 30, 2021, the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement amortizes in equal quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount, with the balance payable on June 23, 2028. We are subject to commitment fees ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% on the undrawn portion of the Revolving Facility, and any outstanding loans under the Revolving Facility will bear interest at either an Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of 1.00% to 1.75% or an Adjusted Base Rate plus a margin of 0% to 0.75%. Our obligations under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement are required to be guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the credit agreement. Such obligations, including the guaranties, are secured by substantially all of our assets and those of the subsidiary guarantors.\nOur material indebtedness adversely affects our operating expenses through increased interest payment obligations and adversely affects our ability to use cash generated from operations as we repay interest at a variable rate, which has been increasing, and principal under the term loans. In addition, the Revolving Facility provisions under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement include financial covenants such as an initial maximum secured net leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00, which temporarily increases to 3.75 to 1.00 following the consummation of certain material permitted acquisitions, and operational covenants that may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain activities, including obtaining additional financing, granting liens, undergoing certain fundamental changes, or making investments or certain restricted payments, and selling assets, and similar transactions, without obtaining the consent of the lenders, which may or may not be forthcoming. The Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement is only subject to operational covenants. Lastly, our borrowing costs can be affected by periodic credit ratings from independent rating agencies. Such ratings are largely based on our performance, which may be measured by credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. Accordingly, outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions.\nSpecifically, our indebtedness and high interest rates have important consequences to investors in our common stock, including the following:\n•high interest rates may make it more difficult for us, our customers, and our distributors to obtain financing and service our respective interest and debt obligations, which in turn has an impact on customer demand for our products as well as the business of our distributors;\n•we are subject to variable interest rate risk because our interest rate under the Initial Term Loan under the June 23, 2021 Credit Agreement varies based on a fixed margin of 2.25% per annum over an adjusted Term SOFR rate or 1.25% per annum over an adjusted base rate and our interest rate for any outstanding principal under the revolving credit facility varies based a margin of 0% to 0.75% over adjusted base rate or a margin of 1.00% to 1.75% over an adjusted Term SOFR rate, and we are also subject to commitment fees ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% on the \nTable of Contents\n\nundrawn portion of the Revolving Facility. If interest rates were to increase substantially, it would adversely affect our operating results and could affect our ability to service our indebtedness; \n•a portion of our cash flows is dedicated to the payment of interest and when applicable, principal, on our indebtedness and other obligations and will not be available for use in our business;\n•our level of indebtedness, combined with high interest rates, could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate, including limiting our future investments or ability to enter into acquisitions and strategic partnerships, and obtain financing for such transactions; and\n•our high degree of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and/or a downturn in our business, thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations.\nIf we fail to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with financial or other covenants in our debt service agreements, which include a maximum leverage ratio, we would be in default under the terms of these agreements. Subject to customary cure rights, any default would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate repayment of this debt and could cause defaults under other indebtedness that we have, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe and our subsidiaries may, subject to any limitations in the terms of our existing loan facilities, incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of our term loans that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments under the indebtedness when due. If we incur any additional debt, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify. Please refer to the Risk Factor entitled “If we are required to pay any damages in connection with legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement with Silicon Motion, including for any alleged breaches of the Merger Agreement, or if we agree to make any payments in any settlement of legal proceedings related to the termination of the Merger Agreement, the amount of such damages or payments could be significant and require us to draw down on all our existing lines of credit and use our cash resources, which may not be sufficient to satisfy any damages or payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We expect that we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all or raise additional capital for any such payments. Even if we are able to finance such payments through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, any material increase in our indebtedness would adversely affect our operating results and cash-flows as we satisfy our underlying interest and principal payment obligations. Issuing additional shares of our common stock, if material, will result in dilution of existing shares outstanding. Any loan agreement is also expected to contain financial and operational covenants that would adversely affect our operational freedom or ability to pursue strategic transactions that we would otherwise consider to be in the best interests of stockholders, including obtaining additional indebtedness to finance such transactions”. \nWe are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, and any inability of us to comply with such obligations may negatively impact our business.\nThe legislative, enforcement policy and regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and cybersecurity issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and complex and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect and otherwise process data, including personal data and other regulated or sensitive data, as part of our business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Regulators in the United States are increasingly scrutinizing personal data transfers. For example, on December 27, 2024 the Department of Justice issued a final rule to implement Executive Order 14117 of February 28, 2024 (“Preventing Access to Americans’ Bulk Sensitive Personal Data and United States Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern.” ) implementing a new framework to protect the privacy of personal data shared between the U.S. and Europe, which may, in effect, impact privacy laws with “countries of concern” such as China or Russia. If we fail to comply with such regulation, it might impact our business to satisfy any fines or additional actions to remain compliant.\nMany foreign countries and governmental bodies, including China, the European Union and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data, and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are currently more restrictive than those in the U.S. These laws may require that our overall information technology security environment meet certain standards and/or be certified. For example, effective May 2018, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that imposed stringent data protection requirements and provided for greater penalties for noncompliance. The United Kingdom has adopted legislation that substantially implements the GDPR and provides for a similar penalty structure. Similarly, California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which took effect in 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt out of certain sharing of their information, and imposes penalties for failure to comply. California has adopted a new law, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, that substantially \nTable of Contents\n\nexpands the CCPA and was effective as of January 1, 2023. Additionally, other U.S. states continue to propose and enact privacy and security-focused legislation. In addition, governments around the world continue to enact laws relating to privacy and data security. For example, in 2021, the National People’s Congress passed the Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China, or the Data Security Law and the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China, or PIPL. The Data Security Law is the first comprehensive data security legislation in the People’s Republic of China, or China, and aims to regulate a wide range of issues in relation to the collection, storage, processing, use, provision, transaction and publication of any kind of data. In March 2024, the Cyberspace Administration of China published the Provisions on Promoting and Standardizing Cross-Border Data Flows to implement the mechanisms for the cross-border data transfers, including the security assessment. These regulations contain provisions that allow substantial government oversight and include fines for failure to obtain required approval from China’s cyber and data protection regulators for cross-border personal data-related data transfers. However, there is still some uncertainty in how regulators will interpret and enforce these laws.\nThe laws outlined above are only a sample of the governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity to which we are subject. Various aspects of these laws, including their interpretation and enforcement, remain unclear, resulting in further uncertainty and potentially requiring us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Because the interpretation and application of many such laws and regulations, remain uncertain and continue to evolve, it is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our products or solutions, and we could face fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, and other claims and penalties, and we could be required to fundamentally change our products or our business practices, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, even if unfounded, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur products must conform to industry standards in order to be accepted by end users in our markets.\nGenerally, our products comprise only a part or parts of a communications device. All components of these devices must uniformly comply with industry standards in order to operate efficiently together. We depend on companies that provide other components of the devices to support prevailing industry standards. Many of these companies are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are. Some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly, and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our customers or end users. If larger companies do not support the same industry standards that we do, or if competing standards emerge, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected, which would harm our business.\nProducts for communications applications are based on industry standards that are continually evolving. Our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards. The emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by other suppliers. As a result, we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards. If our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time, we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins. We may not be successful in developing or using new technologies or in developing new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance. Our pursuit of necessary technological advances may require substantial time and expense.\nWe may, from time to time, make additional business acquisitions or investments, which involve significant risks. \nWe have completed multiple acquisitions in the past decade. We may also enter into alliances or make investments in other businesses to complement our existing product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities. Any such transactions has resulted and could result in:\n•issuances of equity securities dilutive to our existing stockholders;\n•substantial cash payments;\n•the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities;\n•large one-time write-offs;\n•amortization expenses related to intangible assets;\nTable of Contents\n\n•a limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards;\n•the diversion of management’s time and attention from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges;\n•stockholder or other litigation relating to the transaction;\n•adverse tax consequences; \n•costs and expenses associated with any undisclosed or potential liabilities; and\n•the potential loss of, or ability to attract, key personnel, customers and suppliers of the acquired businesses.\nTo the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash or through borrowings under our Revolving Facility, it would reduce our cash balances and/or result in indebtedness we must service, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. If the purchase price is paid with our stock, it would be dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, we may assume liabilities associated with a business acquisition or investment, including unrecorded liabilities that are not discovered at the time of the transaction, and the repayment of those liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. \nIntegrating acquired organizations and their products and services, including the integration of completed acquisitions, may be expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationships with employees, customers, distributors and suppliers, and ultimately may not be successful. The benefits or synergies we may expect from the acquisition of complementary or supplementary businesses may not be realized to the extent or in the time frame we initially anticipate. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses include those associated with:\n•failure to successfully further develop the acquired products or technology;\n•conforming the acquired company’s standards, policies, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n•coordinating new product and process development, especially with respect to highly complex technologies;\n•loss of key employees or customers of the acquired business;\n•hiring additional management and other key personnel;\n•in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n•increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n•consolidation of facilities, integration of the acquired businesses’ accounting, human resource and other administrative functions and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions;\n•the geographic distance between the businesses;\n•liability for activities of the acquired businesses before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n•litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired businesses, including claims for terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, or even if we do identify suitable candidates, they may be difficult to finance, expensive to fund and there is no guarantee that we can obtain any necessary antitrust approvals or complete such transactions on terms that are favorable to us. \nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be party to litigation related to acquisitions. Any adverse determination in litigation resulting from acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nTable of Contents\n\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nWe have settled in the past intellectual property litigation and may in the future face additional claims of intellectual property infringement, including indemnification claims based on intellectual property allegations. Any current or future litigation could be time-consuming, costly to prosecute, defend or settle and result in damages and/or the loss of significant rights.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by companies that hold large numbers of patents and other intellectual property rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce intellectual property rights. Third parties have in the past and may in the future assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. For example, we were involved in a litigation with Bell Semiconductor, which has since been settled pursuant to a Settlement and Patent License Agreement. In addition, from time to time, we receive correspondence from competitors and other third parties seeking to engage us in discussions concerning potential claims against us, and we receive correspondence from customers seeking indemnification for potential claims related to infringement claims asserted against down-stream users of our products. We investigate these requests and claims as received and could be required to enter license agreements with respect to third-party intellectual property rights or indemnify third parties, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results. \nClaims that our products, processes or technology infringe third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution are costly to defend or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. In addition, many of our customer and distributor agreements require us to indemnify and defend our customers or distributors from third-party infringement claims and pay damages and attorneys’ fees in the case of adverse rulings. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers or distributors and might deter future customers from doing business with us. In order to maintain our relationships with existing customers and secure business from new customers, we have been required from time to time to provide additional assurances beyond our standard terms. If any of our current or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:\n•cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology;\n•pay substantial damages, indemnification expenses and attorneys’ fees;\n•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing products, processes or technology;\n•license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n•cross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or\n•pay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing technology sold to them with non-infringing technology.\nAny of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in some countries. Some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application. We cannot guarantee that:\n•any of our present or future patents or patent claims will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned;\n•our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us;\nTable of Contents\n\n•our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will not be limited by our agreements with third parties or obligations, if any, to standards organizations;\n•any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;\n•our intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak;\n•any of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned;\n•we will not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against or to license our technology to others and collect consideration that we are entitled to under certain intellectual property sale agreements; or\n•our ability to monetize our portfolio through divestiture and/or exclusive licensing transactions will not be impacted by conduct of counterparties to any such transactions, and we will not face liability arising from our monetization efforts.\nIn addition, our competitors or others may design around our protected patents or technologies. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions relative to those protections available in the United States, or may not be applied for in one or more relevant jurisdictions. If we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights, an adverse decision in any of these legal actions could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may have occurred or may occur in the future. Although we have taken steps to minimize the risk of this occurring, any such failure to identify unauthorized use and otherwise adequately protect our intellectual property would adversely affect our business. Moreover, if we are required to commence litigation, whether as a plaintiff or defendant as has occurred in the past, not only will this be time-consuming, but we will also be forced to incur significant costs and divert our attention and efforts of our employees, which could, in turn, result in lower revenue and higher expenses.\nWe also rely on customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and consultants, and we implement security measures to protect our trade secrets. We cannot assure you that these contractual protections and security measures will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our suppliers, employees or consultants will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of such contracts. For example, as described in Part I, Item 3 — Legal Proceedings – Comcast Litigation, Comcast shared our proprietary designs with our direct competitor. Comcast then worked with our competitor to develop the FDX-amplifier technology. We have brought claims for trade secret misappropriation, unfair competition, and breach of the parties’ non-disclosure agreement, and sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages, punitive damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, costs, expenses, and attorney fees as well as an injunction against Comcast’s use or disclosure of our trade secrets. However, our claims may not be successful. \nIn addition, we have a number of third-party patent and intellectual property license agreements. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time payments or ongoing royalty payments. Also, a few of our license agreements contain most-favored nation clauses or other price restriction clauses which may affect the amount we may charge for our products, processes or technology. We cannot guarantee that the third-party patents and technology we license will not be licensed to our competitors or others in the semiconductor industry. In the future, we may need to obtain additional licenses, renew existing license agreements or otherwise replace existing technology. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed or the technology can be replaced on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWhen we originally settled a trademark dispute with Analog Devices International Unlimited Company (ADIUC) and its predecessor, Linear Technology Corporation, we agreed not to register the “MAXLINEAR” mark or any other marks containing the term “LINEAR”. Pursuant to the original settlement agreement, we agreed not to use the “MAXLINEAR” mark on our products. We have since entered into another settlement agreement with ADIUC that now allows us to use and register the “MAXLINEAR” mark on our products, in addition to continuing to use “MAXLINEAR” as a corporate identifier, including to advertise our products and services. We have filed trademark applications to register the “MAXLINEAR” mark, but prior to approval of the applications and registration of the mark in the relevant jurisdictions, our ability to effectively prevent third parties from using the “MAXLINEAR” mark in connection with similar products or technology will be based on our common law rights in the mark, which may make enforcement challenging. If we are unable to protect our trademarks in certain \nTable of Contents\n\njurisdictions, we may experience difficulties in achieving and maintaining brand recognition and customer loyalty in such jurisdictions.\nWe face risks related to security vulnerabilities in our products. \nWe regularly become aware of security vulnerabilities with respect to our products as well as intellectual property that we purchase or license from third parties for use in our products. Our products are used in application areas that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risks, including applications that gather and process large amounts of data, such as the cloud or Internet of Things, or artificial intelligence, and critical infrastructure, payment card applications, and automotive applications. Security features in our products cannot make our products entirely secure, and security vulnerabilities identified in our products have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, attempts by third parties to identify and exploit additional vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are not always mitigated before they become known. We, our customers, and the users of our products do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully assess the magnitude or effects of a vulnerability, including the extent, if any, to which a vulnerability has been exploited.\nMitigation techniques designed to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis, or at all, and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications. In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether, when, and how to develop and deploy mitigations. We and such third parties make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation. Subsequent events or new information can develop that changes our assessment of the impact of a security vulnerability, which can cause certain claims or customer satisfaction considerations, as well as result in litigation or regulatory inquiries or actions over these matters.\nSecurity vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, non-compliance with standards, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers, regulators and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties. Security vulnerabilities and any limitations or adverse effects of mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material. \nThe use of open source software in our products, processes and technology may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property.\nOur products, processes and technology sometimes utilize and incorporate software that is subject to an open source license. Open source software is typically freely accessible, usable and modifiable. Certain open source software licenses require a user who intends to distribute the open source software as a component of the user’s software to disclose publicly part or all of the source code to the user’s software. In addition, certain open source software licenses require the user of such software to make any derivative works of the open source code available to others on unfavorable terms or at no cost. This can subject previously proprietary software to open source license terms.\nWhile we monitor the use of all open source software in our products, processes and technology and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product, processes or technology when we do not wish to do so, such use could inadvertently occur. Additionally, if a third party software provider has incorporated certain types of open source software into software we license from such third party for our products, processes or technology, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our products, processes or technology. This could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Reliance on Third-Parties\nWe do not have long-term supply contracts with most of our contract manufacturers or suppliers, and any disruption in our supply of products or materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and operating results.\nCurrently we do not have long-term supply contracts with most of our other third-party vendors, including but, not limited to TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC. Certain products are supplied to us by Intel on a turnkey basis at agreed upon prices under terms of a supply agreement with an initial term of five years, which will expire in July 2025. \nTable of Contents\n\nIntel can also terminate its supply agreement with us under certain circumstances. If Intel does not continue to supply us with such products, we would need to seek alternative sources of supply for those products in a short timeframe, which would cause us to incur additional costs, could delay the sale of such products, and could increase our supply costs with a new vendor, which in turn, could negatively impact our revenue and our gross margins. Alternatively, if Intel does continue to supply us with such products, the costs of such products would likely increase and reduce our margins on such products, and their minimum purchase requirements may exceed our current customer demand. \nWe make substantially all of our purchases on a purchase order basis, and our contract manufacturers are not required to supply us products for any specific period or in any specific quantity. Foundry capacity may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. Availability of foundry capacity has in the past been reduced from time to time due to strong demand. Foundries can allocate capacity to the production of other companies’ products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice. It is possible that foundry customers that are larger and better financed than we are, or that have long-term agreements with our foundry, may induce our foundry to reallocate capacity to them. This reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need. We generally place orders for products with some of our suppliers approximately four to five months prior to the anticipated delivery date, with order volumes based on our forecasts of demand from our customers. Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products or if orders are placed with a short lead-time, we may be unable to obtain adequate and cost-effective foundry or assembly capacity from our third-party contractors to meet our customers’ delivery requirements, which could harm our reputation and customer relationships, or we may accumulate excess inventories. On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders and therefore were unable to benefit from this incremental demand. None of our third-party contractors has provided any assurance to us that adequate capacity will be available to us within the time required to meet additional demand for our products.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing facilities and rely on a limited number of third parties to manufacture, assemble, and test our products. The failure to manage our relationships with our third-party contractors successfully, or impacts from volatility in global supply, natural disasters, public health crises, or other labor stoppages in the regions where such contractors operate, could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products.\nWe operate an outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities. As a result, we rely on third-party foundry wafer fabrication, including sole sourcing for many components or products. Currently, a large portion of our products are manufactured by TSMC, and United Microelectronics Corporation, or UMC, at foundries located in Taiwan, Singapore, and China. We also use third-party contractors for all of our assembly and test operations. We also rely on Intel Corporation, or Intel, for certain products on a turnkey basis at agreed upon prices under terms of a supply agreement with an initial term of five years, which will expire in July 2025 and may be terminated by Intel under certain circumstances.\nRelying on third party manufacturing, assembly and testing presents significant risks to us, including the following:\n•capacity shortages during periods of high demand or from events beyond our control or inventory oversupply during periods of decreased demand. For example, we have experienced and could continue to experience inventory oversupply in certain of our products due to changes in customer demand which has added to volatility in managing the business. Inventory oversupply has also led and could continue to lead to inventory write-downs, including charges for any excess or obsolete inventory, which could negatively impact our gross margins;\n•failure by us, our customers, or their end customers to qualify a selected supplier;\n•reduced control over delivery schedules and quality;\n•shortages of materials;\n•misappropriation of our intellectual property;\n•limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us; \n•potential increases in costs of our products;\n•costs to switch to alternate sources of supply for certain products and/or delays in sales of such products, if a supplier does not continue to supply certain products; and\n•our use of foundry partners who are currently subject to BIS restrictions, to manufacture certain of our products may be impaired if one or more of the following were to occur: (1) we are unable to obtain U.S. export licenses \nTable of Contents\n\nauthorizing its interactions and technology exchanges with these foundry partners or if there are delays in obtaining such licenses, or (2) if BIS increases export control restrictions to Chinese foundries without the ability for us to obtain a U.S. export license, or (3) U.S. providers of semiconductor manufacturer equipment are unable to export such equipment or related spare or replacement parts used in the manufacture of our products, or obtain a license to export such equipment and parts, to current or future Chinese foundry partners.\nThe ability and willingness of our third-party contractors to perform is largely outside our control. If one or more of our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, in the event that manufacturing capacity is reduced or eliminated at one or more facilities, manufacturing could be disrupted, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders and our net revenue could decline. In addition, if these third parties fail to deliver quality products and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders, our net revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our product shipment and manufacturing capacity may be similarly reduced or eliminated at one or more facilities due to the fact that the majority of our fabrication and assembly and test contractors are all located in the Pacific Rim region, principally in China, Taiwan, and Singapore. The risk of earthquakes in these geographies is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines, and Taiwan in particular is also subject to typhoons and other Pacific storms, and more recently, a drought impacting the water supply which chip manufacturers rely upon to fabricate chip products. Earthquakes, wildfires and other fires, flooding, drought, or other natural disasters in Taiwan or the Pacific Rim region, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, in countries where our contractors’ facilities are located could result in the disruption of our product shipments, foundry, assembly, or test capacity. If such disruption were to recur over a prolonged period, it could have a material impact on our revenues and our business. Any disruption resulting from similar events on a larger scale or over a prolonged period could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to resume such shipments, or shift our manufacturing, assembly, or test from the affected contractor to another third-party vendor, if needed. If such disruption were to recur over a prolonged period, it could have a material impact on our revenue and business. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our distributors’ product inventories and product sell-through. Should any of our distributors cease or be forced to stop distributing our products, our business would suffer.\nWe currently sell a significant portion of our products to customers through our distributors, who maintain their own inventories of our products. Sales to distributors accounted for approximately 44%, 50% and 46% of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Upon shipment of product to these distributors, title to the inventory transfers to the distributor and the distributor is invoiced, generally with 30 to 60 day terms. Distributor sales are also recognized upon shipment to the distributor and estimates of future pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights reduce revenue recognized to the net amount before the actual amounts are known. If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.\nIf our distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventories of our products in a given quarter to manufacturers and end users or if they decide to decrease their inventories of our products for any reason, our sales through these distributors and our revenue may decline. In addition, if some distributors decide to purchase more of our products than are required to satisfy end customer demand in any particular quarter, inventories at these distributors would grow in that quarter. These distributors could then reduce future orders until inventory levels realign with end customer demand, which has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our product revenue.\nOur reserve estimates with respect to the products stocked by our distributors are based principally on reports provided to us by our distributors, typically on a weekly basis. To the extent that this resale and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received in a timely manner, we may not be able to make reserve estimates accurately or at all.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services and technology necessary for the operation of our business. Any failure of one or more of our partners, vendors, suppliers or licensors to provide these services or technology could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide critical services, including, among other things, services related to accounting, billing, compliance, internal audit, human resources, information technology, network development, network monitoring, in-licensing and intellectual property that we cannot or do not create or provide ourselves. We depend on these vendors to ensure \nTable of Contents\n\nthat our corporate infrastructure will consistently meet our business requirements and legal obligations. The ability of these third-party vendors to successfully provide reliable and high quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, our agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive. In addition, we do not know whether we will be able to collect on any award of damages or that these damages would be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur as a result of any vendor’s failure to perform under its agreement with us. Any failure of our corporate infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third-party vendors, we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions, including service levels and cost, that are favorable to us and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete.\nAdditionally, we incorporate third-party technology into and with some of our products, and we may do so in future products. The operation of our products could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party technology we use, including as a result of information technology failures from cyber-attacks on or security breaches of third parties. It may be more difficult for us to correct any errors in a timely manner if at all because the development and maintenance of the technology is not within our control. There can be no assurance that these third parties will continue to make their technology, or improvements to the technology, available to us, or that they will continue to support and maintain their technology. Further, due to the limited number of vendors of some types of technology, it may be difficult to obtain new licenses or replace existing technology. Any impairment of the technology or our relationship with these third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile as a result of various factors.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, in the year ended December 31, 2024, the trading price of our common stock ranged from a low of $11.08 to a high of $26.59. These factors include those discussed in this “Risk Factors” section of this report and others such as:\n•any developments related to our terminated merger with Silicon Motion;\n•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n•overall conditions in the semiconductor market;\n•addition or loss of significant customers;\n•changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including export controls;\n•geopolitical changes impacting our business and markets, including with respect to China and Taiwan and the change in the U.S. presidential administration;\n•actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n•announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n•announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n•departures of, and inability to attract, qualified key personnel;\n•competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n•issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n•fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n•disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our technologies;\n•actions by institutional or activist stockholders;\nTable of Contents\n\n•acquisitions may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share;\n•announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n•sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders; and\n•general economic and market conditions, including the impacts from sanctions against Russia and the military conflicts in Ukraine and among Israel, Iran and Lebanon, increased inflationary pressures, and interest rate changes.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including us. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. \nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock are attractive to momentum, hedge, day-trading, or activist investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, and have also been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of momentum, hedge, day-trading, or activist investors, and have been and may continue to be the target of securities class action litigation in the future. Stockholder activism or securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. A proxy contest or other activist behaviors could have an adverse effect on us. \nEven if a proxy contest or other activist efforts are not successful, the increased costs that we would bear and the distraction of our Board of Directors and senior management could negatively impact our business, although we cannot predict with certainty the extent of such negative impacts.\nOur management team may use our available cash and cash equivalents in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a return.\nWe use our cash and cash equivalents for general corporate purposes, including working capital and for repayment of outstanding long-term debt. We may also, in the future, use a portion of our assets to acquire other complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. Our management has considerable discretion in the application of our cash and cash equivalents, and resources, and you will not have the opportunity to assess whether these liquid assets are being used in a manner that you deem best to maximize your return. We may use our available cash and cash equivalents and resources for corporate purposes that do not increase our operating results or market value. In addition, in the future our cash and cash equivalents, and resources may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions provide for the following:\n•authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 25,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n•require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n•specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, or our President;\n•establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors;\n•establish that our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving staggered terms;\nTable of Contents\n\n•provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n•provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n•specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n•require super majority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally restricts a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 84.6 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nAll shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act unless held by our “affiliates,” as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. \nOur Executive Incentive Bonus Plan permits the settlement of awards under the plan in the form of shares of our common stock. We have issued shares of our common stock to settle such bonus awards for our employees, including executives, for the 2014 to 2023 performance periods, and we intend to continue this practice in the foreseeable future, subject to availability of such shares under our stock plans. We issued 0.4 million shares of our common stock for the 2023 performance period in February 2024. If we issue additional shares of our common stock to settle bonus awards in the future, such shares may be freely sold in the public market immediately following the issuance of such shares, subject to the applicable conditions of Rule 144 and our insider trading policy, and the issuance of such shares may have a material adverse effect on our share price once they are issued.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we suffer losses to our facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed. \nOur facilities and distribution system, and those of our third-party contractors, are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, drought or other natural or man-made disasters. A number of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are located in areas with above average seismic activity and/or which have experienced more frequent, more \nTable of Contents\n\nextreme and less predictable weather conditions. For example, the risk of an earthquake in the Pacific Rim region, including Taiwan, or Southern California is significant due to the proximity of major earthquake fault lines, and Taiwan in particular is also subject to typhoons and other Pacific storms, and drought impacting the water supply which chip manufacturers rely upon to fabricate chip products. Further, wildfire risks have increased in California and our offices and/or personnel could be impacted by damages, losses, power outages including safety shutoffs, and/or mandatory evacuations. We have experienced higher insurance costs and may experience a decrease in available coverage in such areas and an increased likelihood of damage, power outages and catastrophic loss to these facilities, which would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility. The majority of the factories we use for foundry, assembly and test, and warehousing services, are located in Asia, principally in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Our corporate headquarters is located in Southern California. Our operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flooding, drought, or other natural disasters in Taiwan or the Pacific Rim region, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, or other natural or man-made disaster in countries where our contractors’ facilities are located. Such catastrophes could result in the disruption of our product shipments, foundry, assembly, or test capacity.\nWe have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with business acquisitions. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets could become impaired and adversely affect our future operating results.\nWe account for business acquisitions as business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. Our acquisitions have resulted in the creation of goodwill and recording of a large amount of intangible assets based upon the application of the acquisition method of accounting. To the extent the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. We conduct our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis on October 31 each year, or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Our reported financial condition and results of operations reflect the balances and results of the acquired businesses but are not restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of acquired businesses for periods prior to the acquisitions. As a result, comparisons of future results against prior period results will be more difficult for investors. In addition, there can be no guarantee that acquired intangible assets, particularly in-process research and development, will generate revenues or profits that we include in our forecast that is the basis for their fair values as of the acquisition date. Any such impairment charges relating to goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material impact on our operating results in future periods, and the announcement of a material impairment could have a material adverse effect on the trading price and trading volume of our common stock. As of December 31, 2024, our balance sheet reflected goodwill of $318.6 million and other intangible assets of $55.0 million. Consequently, we could recognize material impairment charges in the future.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or unanticipated tax obligations could affect our future results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, Singapore and various other foreign jurisdictions. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to our interpretation and application of tax laws in jurisdictions in which we file. Changes in current or future laws or regulations, the imposition of new or changed tax laws or regulations or new interpretations by taxing authorities or courts could affect our results of operations and lead to volatility with respect to tax expenses and liabilities from period to period. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 174. This has increased our effective tax rate and our cash tax payable since 2022. If the requirement to capitalize Section 174 expenditures is not modified, it may impact our effective tax rate and our cash tax liability for taxable years during which we are required to capitalize such expenditures. The CHIPS and Science Act, or CHIPS Act, enacted on August 9, 2022, provides a tax credit to semiconductor manufacturing activities within the United States. Because we currently outsource our manufacturing, we do not expect to be entitled to such tax incentives. Further, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, enacted on August 16, 2022, imposes a 1% non-deductible excise tax on repurchases of stock that are made by U.S. publicly traded corporations on or after January 1, 2023. The IRA also imposes a 15% alternative minimum tax on corporations with an average of at least $1 billion of adjusted financial statement income over a three-year period. The application of tax laws and related regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. We cannot determine whether any legislative proposals may be enacted into law or what, if any, changes may be made to such proposals prior to their being enacted into law. If U.S. or international tax laws change in a manner that increases our tax obligation, it could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial position. \nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition, many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” proposals). Some countries intend to implement laws based on Pillar Two proposals, which may adversely impact our provision for income taxes, net income and cash flows. As a result of this heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject to enforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any such changes may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change.\nOur income tax provision is subject to volatility and our ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income may be limited, which may adversely impact our future effective tax rate and operating results.\nExcess tax benefits associated with employee stock-based compensation are included in income tax expense. However, since the amount of such excess tax benefits and deficiencies depend on the fair market value of our common stock, our income tax provision is subject to volatility in our stock price and in the future, could unfavorably affect our future effective tax rate.\nOur future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the ultimate use and depletion of these various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. Changes in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence quarterly, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. Realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income in the applicable jurisdiction. On a periodic basis we evaluate our deferred tax assets for realizability. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a full valuation allowance against our Singapore deferred tax assets. Based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence, as of December 31, 2024, we continue to have a valuation allowance on state deferred tax assets, certain federal deferred tax assets, and certain foreign deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where we have cumulative losses or otherwise are not expected to utilize certain tax attributes. The impact of releasing some or all of such valuation allowance in a future period could be material in the period in which such release occurs. Additionally, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted in the subsequent periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is present. Any future changes in the deferred tax asset realizability assertion may require a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets, which would increase our tax expense in the period the allowance is recognized and affect our results of operations. \nOur corporate income tax liability could materially increase if tax incentives we have negotiated in Singapore cease to be effective or applicable or if we are challenged on our use of such incentives. \nWe operate under certain favorable tax incentives in Singapore which are effective through March 2027, and generally are dependent on our meeting certain headcount and investment thresholds. Such incentives allow certain qualifying income earned in Singapore to be taxed at reduced rates and are conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds over time. If we fail to satisfy the conditions for receipt of these tax incentives, or to the extent U.S. or other tax authorities challenge our operation under these favorable tax incentive programs or our intercompany transfer pricing agreements, our taxable income could be taxed at higher federal or foreign statutory rates and our income tax liability and expense could materially increase beyond our projections. Each of our Singapore tax incentives is separate and distinct from the others, and may be granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. Absent these tax incentives, our corporate income tax rate in Singapore would generally be the 17% statutory tax rate. We are also subject to operating and other compliance requirements to maintain our favorable tax incentives. If we fail to comply with such requirements, we could lose the tax benefits and could possibly be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits. Additionally, in the future, we may fail to qualify for renewal of our favorable tax incentives or such incentives may not be available to us, which could also cause our future taxable income to increase and be taxed at higher statutory rates. Loss of one more of our tax incentives could cause us to modify our tax strategies and our operational structure, which could cause disruption in our business and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, there can be no guarantee that such modification in our tax strategy will yield tax incentives as favorable as those we have negotiated with Singapore. Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on \nTable of Contents\n\nany taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows.\nInvestor confidence may be adversely impacted if we are unable to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and as a result, our stock price could decline.\nWe are subject to rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require us to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K our management’s report on, and assessment of the effectiveness of, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, there is a risk that we will not comply with all of the requirements imposed by Section 404. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. Any of these possible outcomes could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and could result in investigations or sanctions by the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, or other regulatory authorities or in stockholder litigation. Any of these factors ultimately could harm our business and could negatively impact the market price of our securities. Ineffective control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.",
