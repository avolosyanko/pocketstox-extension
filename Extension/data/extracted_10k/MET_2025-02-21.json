We hold leading market positions in the United States (“U.S.”), Asia, Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. We are also one of the largest institutional investors in the U.S. with a general account portfolio invested primarily in fixed income securities (corporate, structured products, municipals, and government and agency) and mortgage loans, as well as real estate, real estate joint ventures, other limited partnerships and equity securities. \nWe believe that our trusted global brand, diversified and resilient business, and position as a leader in attractive markets are the powers of our business. Over the next five years we will execute on our New Frontier strategy, which was designed to accelerate growth across our global platform while delivering attractive returns and all-weather performance. New Frontier builds upon the success of our Next Horizon strategy, which we implemented in 2019, with an aim to focus, simplify and differentiate the Company.\nUnder our New Frontier strategy, we intend to leverage the Company’s strengths to prioritize growth across four key areas of opportunity:\n\n•Extend our leadership in Group Benefits;          \n•Capitalize on our unique retirement platform;     \n•Accelerate our growth in Asset Management; and    \n•Expand in high growth international markets.      \nMetLife is organized into six segments: Group Benefits; Retirement and Income Solutions (“RIS”); Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See “— Segments and Corporate & Other” and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s segments and Corporate & Other.\n\n                                                MetLife                                                                                                                 \nGroup Benefits                RIS               Asia                                         Latin America                 EMEA              MetLife Holdings           \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, MetLife and General Atlantic, L.P. (“General Atlantic”) announced the formation of a life and annuity reinsurance company, Chariot Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Chariot Re”) which is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. MetLife will own an equity interest in Chariot Re. MetLife is targeting ceding a block of liabilities composed of structured settlement annuity contracts and group annuity contracts associated with pension risk transfers to Chariot Re. MetLife Investment Management and General Atlantic will exclusively provide global investment management services to Chariot Re.\nSegments and Corporate & Other \nWe offer a broad range of products and services aimed at serving the financial needs of our customers. We sell these products to corporations and other institutions (including local, state and federal governments) and their respective employees, as well as individuals.\nGroup Benefits\nWe have built a leading position in the U.S. group insurance market through long-standing relationships with many of the largest employers in the U.S.\nOur Group Benefits segment, based in the U.S., offers life insurance, dental, group short- and long-term disability, paid family and medical leave, individual disability, accidental death and dismemberment (“AD&D”) insurance, accident & health insurance, and vision, as well as prepaid legal plans and pet insurance. We also sell administrative services-only (“ASO”) arrangements to some employers.\nWe distribute Group Benefits products and services through a sales force primarily comprised of MetLife employees that is segmented by the size of the target customer. Account executives sell either directly to corporate and other group customers or through an intermediary, such as a broker or consultant. Employers have been emphasizing voluntary products and, as a result, we have increased our focus on communicating and marketing to employees in order to further foster sales of those products.\nWe have entered into arrangements with third parties to expand opportunities to market and distribute Group Benefits products and services. We also sell Group Benefits products and services through sponsoring associations and affinity groups and provide life, dental, accident & health, and vision coverage to certain employees of the U.S. Government. We have longstanding relationships with these employees and continue to cultivate and expand them through additional product offerings.\nOur Group Benefits segment quarterly claims experience may vary, as seasonal illnesses effect mortality and morbidity, and due to utilization rate fluctuation in our non-medical health businesses. Annual benefit renewal implementation, enrollment, and marketing costs normally elevate expenses for the Group Benefits segment in the fourth quarter.\n\nMajor Products                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nTerm Life Insurance                    A guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified time period in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Premiums may be guaranteed at a level amount for the coverage period or may be non-level and non-guaranteed. Term contracts expire without value at the end of the coverage period when the insured party is still living.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \nVariable Life Insurance                Insurance coverage through a contract that gives the policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with certain guarantees. Premiums and account balances can be directed by the policyholder into a variety of separate account investment options or directed to the Company’s general account. In the separate account investment options, the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment results. With some products, by maintaining certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse investment experience.     \nUniversal Life Insurance               Insurance coverage on the same basis as variable life, except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances, are allocated only to the Company’s general account. With some products, by maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse investment experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nDental                                 Insurance and ASO arrangements that assist employees, retirees and their families in maintaining oral health while reducing out-of-pocket expenses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nDisability                             Insurance and ASO arrangements for groups and individuals to provide benefits for income replacement, payment of business overhead expenses or mortgage protection, in the event of the disability of the insured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \nAccident &amp; Health Insurance        Accident, critical illness or hospital indemnity coverage to the insured.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \nVision                                 Insurance, ASO arrangements, and managed eye health and vision care solutions to assist employees, retirees and their families in maintaining vision health while reducing out-of-pocket expenses.

Participating contract benefits are purchased for retired, terminated, or active employees covered under active or terminated pension plans. The assets supporting the guaranteed benefits for each contract are held in a separate account, however, the Company fully guarantees all benefit payments. Non-participating contracts have economic features similar to our general account product, but offer the added protection of an insulated separate account. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), these annuity contracts are treated as general account products.    \nInstitutional Income Annuities         General account contracts that are guaranteed payout annuities purchased for employees upon retirement or termination of employment. Contracts can be life or non-life contingent non-participating contracts which do not provide for any loan or cash surrender value and, with few exceptions, do not permit future considerations.                                                                                  \nStructured Settlements                 Customized annuities designed to serve as an alternative to a lump sum payment in a lawsuit initiated because of personal injury, wrongful death, or a workers’ compensation claim or other claim for damages. Surrenders are generally not allowed, although commutations are permitted in certain circumstances. Guaranteed payments consist of life contingent annuities, term certain annuities and lump sums.      \n\nRisk Solutions                            Longevity Reinsurance Solutions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Longevity reinsurance is a risk mitigation solution for United Kingdom (“U.K.”) pension plan sponsors and U.K. insurance companies that write pension risk transfer business, converting uncertain future pension benefit obligations into a fixed stream of payments to MetLife over the duration of the contract as opposed to a lump sum at inception in typical pension risk transfer transactions.                                                                                                                             \nBenefit Funding Solutions                 Specialized life insurance products and funding agreements designed specifically to provide solutions for funding postretirement benefits and company-, bank- or trust-owned life insurance used to finance nonqualified benefit programs for executives.                                 \nFunded Reinsurance Solutions              Funded reinsurance is a risk mitigation tool for insurance companies that write pension risk transfer business primarily in the U.K. It provides a single-premium reinsurance solution that transfers both the longevity risk and investment risk associated with U.K. bulk pensions.     \nCapital Markets Investment Products                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    • Funding agreement-backed notes are offered in medium term note programs, under which funding agreements are issued to special-purpose trusts that issue marketable notes in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies.

Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders may receive dividends in cash, or apply them to increase death benefits, increase cash values available upon surrender or reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \nVariable Annuities                                 Variable annuities provide for asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Variable annuities allow the contractholder to allocate deposits into various investment options in a separate account, as determined by the contractholder. In certain variable annuity products, contractholders may also choose to allocate all or a portion of their account to the Company’s general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Contractholders may also elect certain minimum death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for which additional fees are charged and where asset allocation restrictions may apply.     \nFixed and Indexed-Linked Annuities                 Fixed annuities provide for asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Deposits made into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the Company’s general account and are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to specified minimums. Fixed income annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified period of years and/or for the life of the annuitant. Additionally, the Company has issued indexed-linked annuities which allow the contractholder to participate in returns from equity indices.                                                                                                                                            \nLong-term Care                                     Protection against the potentially high costs of long-term health care services. Generally pays benefits to insureds who need assistance with activities of daily living or have a cognitive impairment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \nCorporate & Other \nCorporate & Other contains various start-up, developing and run-off businesses. Also included in Corporate & Other are: the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments (including external integration and disposition costs, internal resource costs for associates committed to acquisitions and dispositions and enterprise-wide strategic initiatives), interest expense related to the majority of the Company’s outstanding debt, expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit issues, the elimination of intersegment amounts (which generally relate to investment expenses and intersegment loans bearing interest rates commensurate with related borrowings), and the Company’s institutional investment management business (through which the Company provides public fixed income, private capital and real estate investment solutions to institutional investors worldwide). \nPolicyholder Liabilities\nWe establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Our liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to be received over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy and the amount of benefits or claims to be paid. We establish liabilities for claims and benefits based on assumptions and estimates of losses and liabilities incurred. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported on the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on policyholder liabilities see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Future Policy Benefit Liabilities.”\nMetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated reinsurers, establish statutory reserves under methods prescribed by the insurance laws of their respective domiciliary jurisdiction. These reserves are reported as liabilities, and we expect them to be sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed rates. Statutory reserves and actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits reported under GAAP generally differ due to the difference in accounting requirements.\nU.S. state insurance laws and regulations require certain MetLife entities to submit an annual opinion and memorandum of a qualified actuary. In it, the qualified actuary states that the statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, adequately provide for the anticipated cash flow required to meet contractual obligations and related expenses. \nInsurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare and submit a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements. See “— Regulation — State Insurance Regulation — Reserves and Asset Adequacy Analysis.”\nUnderwriting and Pricing \nWe use a variety of underwriting and pricing management controls. Our Global Risk Management department develops product pricing standards and oversees underwriting practices in MetLife’s insurance businesses. We also regularly conduct experience studies to monitor assumptions against expectations, impose formal new product approval processes, periodically update product profitability studies, and use reinsurance to manage our exposures, as appropriate. See “— Reinsurance Activity.”\nUnderwriting\nOur underwriters and actuaries use detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures to assess and quantify insurance risks, and determine the type and the amount of risk we are willing to accept.\nInsurance underwriters consider an applicant’s medical history and other factors such as financial profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco use. Group insurance underwriters generally evaluate the risk characteristics of the prospective insured group, but may underwrite members of a group on an individual basis for certain voluntary products and coverages. Our own employees generally perform our underwriting, but intermediaries review certain policies under guidelines established by us. Generally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. We review requests for coverage on their merits and issue policies only after we have examined and approved the particular risk or group under our underwriting guidelines.\nWe periodically review all our underwriting to maintain high standards of quality and consistency. Our reinsurers generally have the right to audit our underwriting.\nWe use underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strategies that we intend to be competitive and suitable for the customer, the agent and us, to facilitate quality sales, and to serve our customers’ needs while supporting our financial strength and business objectives. We aim to ensure that underwriting risk levels are appropriately reflected in our product pricing. \nWe continually review our underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strategies in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate. \nPricing\nProduct pricing reflects our globally consistent standards. Regional product and finance teams price all of our insurance business with oversight from Global Risk Management. We base our pricing on the expected benefits payout which we calculate through the use of assumptions for mortality, longevity, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment returns and macroeconomic factors such as inflation. We price investment-oriented products based on factors such as investment returns, expenses, persistency, optionality, and possible variability of results. \nOur pricing of certain products may include prospective and retrospective experience rating features. For prospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine future premium rates and we bear all prior year gains and losses. For retrospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine our cost of providing insurance for the customer in light of any features that allow us to recoup certain losses or distribute certain gains back to the policyholder based on prior years’ experience.\n We continually review our pricing guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate. \nReinsurance Activity\nWe enter into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for our various insurance products and also as a provider of reinsurance for some pension products and insurance products issued by third parties. We purchase reinsurance in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. Our reinsurance covers individual risks, group risks, or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess, or catastrophe excess basis. The extent of our retained risks depends on our risk evaluation, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on our risk appetite. We also cede first dollar mortality risk under certain contracts. We reinsure both mortality and other risks. We obtain reinsurance for capital requirement purposes and when its economic impact makes it appropriate to do so.\nWe also reinsure for risk and capital management purposes among affiliates, including affiliated U.S. captive reinsurers and affiliated non-U.S. reinsurers. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital — Affiliated Reinsurance Transactions.” \nFor information regarding reinsurance by segment, our catastrophic coverage, and ceded reinsurance recoverable balances, included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRegulation \nOverview\nIn the U.S., state regulators primarily regulate our life insurance companies, with additional federal regulation of some of our products and services. The insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions apply to MetLife, Inc. and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Furthermore, consumer protection laws, privacy, anti-money laundering, securities, commodities, broker-dealer and investment adviser regulations, environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) also apply to some of MetLife’s operations, products and services.\nOutside of the U.S., insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our insurance businesses are located or operate principally regulate those businesses. In addition, securities, pension, and other authorities oversee our investment and pension companies where they operate. Regulators also subject our non-U.S. insurance businesses to current and developing solvency regimes, which impose various capital and other requirements. Additionally, regulators may enhance their capital standards and supervision, and impose additional non-U.S. and global regulatory initiatives.\nSet forth below is a summary of the material regulatory frameworks applicable to MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nU.S. Federal Initiatives\nU.S. federal initiatives can affect our business in a variety of ways, including regulation of financial services, securities, derivatives, pensions, health care, money laundering, foreign sanctions and corrupt practices, and taxation. \nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) increased the federal role in regulating businesses such as ours, including in the following ways:\n•    The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) may designate certain financial companies that pose a threat to U.S. financial stability as non-bank systemically important financial institutions (“non-bank SIFI”) subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n•    The Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the Department of the Treasury may participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., collect information about the insurance industry, and recommend prudential standards.\n•    If an entity such as MetLife, Inc. or another non-insurance financial institution faces insolvency or threat of default significantly impacting U.S. financial stability, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) could liquidate it as a receiver. In that case, the Bankruptcy Code, which ordinarily governs liquidations, would not apply. The FDIC’s purpose would be mitigating the systemic risks the institution’s failure poses, rather than adhering to traditional bankruptcy objectives, possibly resulting in different creditor treatment. However, state insurance laws would continue to apply to an insurance company resolution.\n•    Dodd-Frank provisions may also affect the investments and investment activities of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including imposing federal regulation of such activities.\nIn 2023, the FSOC adopted final guidance establishing a new process for designating certain financial companies as non-bank SIFIs. This revised approach evaluates risk factors such as leverage, liquidity risk and maturity mismatch, interconnections, operational risks, complexity, or opacity, inadequate risk management, concentration, and destabilizing activities, regardless of whether those risks arise from activities, firms, or otherwise. Under the guidance, the FSOC is no longer required to conduct a cost-benefit analysis and an assessment of the likelihood of a non-bank financial company’s material financial distress before considering the designation of the company. The revised process could have the effect of simplifying and shortening FSOC’s procedures for designating certain financial companies as non-bank SIFIs, thereby subjecting such companies to additional supervision, examination, and regulation. Any such designation would create uncertainties for the non-bank financial company regarding the likelihood, frequency or impact of any formal or informal regulatory or supervisory actions or inquiries; the scope of applicable regulatory or supervisory requirements or restrictions and the related compliance measures and internal controls; and the permissibility of certain activities or transactions. It is difficult to predict the potential impact of these changes. \nThe Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act amended the McCarran-Ferguson Act, extending U.S. antitrust laws to encompass the “business of health insurance” and broadening U.S. regulatory authority accordingly. Consequently, we anticipate increased regulatory oversight and litigation risk for U.S. products, including dental and vision. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”\nHealth Care Regulation\nDemand for and pricing of products is subject to tax uncertainty. Federal health care statutes and corresponding regulations have increased costs unpredictably for certain products and may have additional adverse effects. They have also harmed our competitive position, as these rules have a disparate impact on our products compared to products offered by our not-for-profit competitors. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”\nU.S. Insurance Holding Company Regulation\nWe are subject to U.S. state insurance holding company laws and regulations that are generally based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (“NAIC”) Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation. These vary by jurisdiction, but generally require a controlled insurance company (an insurer that is a subsidiary of an insurance holding company) to register and file reports with state regulatory authorities about its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, intercompany transactions, and general business operations. Furthermore, state holding company laws require the ultimate controlling person of a U.S. insurer to file an annual enterprise risk report with the lead state of the insurance holding company system. This report identifies risks likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Each of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states has implemented these requirements. The holding company laws also authorize state insurance commissioners to act as global group-wide supervisors for internationally active insurance groups (“IAIGs”). All states have adopted laws and regulations enhancing group-wide supervision.\nState Insurance Regulation \nEach of MetLife’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in its jurisdiction of domicile and/or in each jurisdiction where it conducts insurance business. The extent of insurance regulation in such jurisdictions varies, but most jurisdictions regulate the financial aspects and business conduct of insurers through broad administrative powers, including: (i) licensing companies and agents to transact business; (ii) regulating certain premium rates; (iii) reviewing and approving certain policy forms, including required policyholder disclosures; (iv) establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards; and (v) with respect to jurisdictions of domicile, restricting dividend payments and other transactions between affiliates.\nEach of our insurance subsidiaries must file reports, generally including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulators in each jurisdiction where it does business. Such authorities will periodically examine their books, records, accounts, and business practices. In 2019, MetLife entered into a consent order with the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) relating to unclaimed property following an open market conduct quinquennial exam, under which it paid a fine and customer restitution, and submitted remediation plans for approval. Except for this consent order and other items as described in Note 24 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, MetLife did not receive any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of its insurance subsidiaries.\nOrganizations like the NAIC encourage insurance supervisors to establish Supervisory Colleges to facilitate cooperation among insurance supervisors to enhance their understanding of risk profiles of U.S.-based insurance groups with international operations. MetLife’s lead state regulator, the NYDFS, annually chairs Supervisory College meetings that MetLife’s key U.S. and non-U.S. regulators attend.\nSurplus and Capital\nInsurers must maintain their capital and surplus at or above minimum levels set in their respective jurisdictions. Regulators possess discretionary authority to limit or prohibit an insurer’s sales to policyholders if the insurer fails to meet these standards or if they find that the further transaction of business would be hazardous to policyholders. For developments that could affect our ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings results, and thus our surplus and capital, see “Risk Factors.”\nDividend Restrictions\nState insurance statutes typically restrict the dividends or other distributions an insurance company subsidiary may pay to its parent company and limit transactions between an insurer and its affiliates. Dividends exceeding prescribed limits and transactions above a specified size between an insurer and its affiliates require domiciliary insurance regulator approval. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — MetLife, Inc. — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.” See also “Dividend Restrictions” in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding such limitations.\nRisk-Based Capital\nMost of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. RBC is calculated annually based on a formula that considers various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items, reflecting asset, insurance, interest rate, and market and business risk characteristics. Regulators use this formula as an early warning tool to identify inadequately capitalized insurers. See “Statutory Equity and Income” in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital — Statutory Capital and Dividends.”\nWe calculate our internally defined “Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio” by dividing the sum of total adjusted capital for MetLife, Inc.’s principal U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life Insurance Company (“American Life”), by the sum of company action level RBC for such subsidiaries, including annual Special Considerations Letters (“SCL\"), as discussed below. Our Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio was in excess of 360% and in excess of 380% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. By contrast, we calculate an “NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio” based on such subsidiaries’ statutory-based financial statements and NAIC capital and reserving standards. This NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio was in excess of 380% and in excess of 400% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nNAIC developments related to the RBC framework are described below.\n•    RBC Revisions. The NAIC approved an RBC update for mortality risk that took effect at year-end 2022, which had a modest positive impact on our reported RBC ratios. In 2023, the NAIC increased the RBC factor for structured security residual tranches from 30% to 45%, which became effective for year-end 2024 RBC filings and had an immaterial impact on RBC. The NAIC is currently reviewing the RBC treatment of collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”). See “— Investments” for additional information.\n•    Bond Project. The NAIC adopted a new, principles-based definition of a bond that became effective in certain statutory accounting guidance as of January 1, 2025. This will result in new reporting and disclosure requirements, and will lead to categorical changes associated with these investments in the regulatory reports. These changes are not expected to have a material impact on RBC.\n•    Interest Maintenance Reserve. In 2023, the NAIC adopted an interim solution with regard to the treatment of an insurer’s negative interest maintenance reserve (“IMR”) balance, which may occur in a rising interest rate environment and can impact how accurately the insurer’s surplus and financial strength are captured in its statutory financial statements due to lower surplus and RBC ratios. The NAIC’s interim statutory accounting guidance is effective until December 31, 2025 and permits an insurer with a company action level RBC ratio greater than 150% (or an authorized control level RBC ratio greater than 300%) to admit negative IMR up to 10% of its general account capital and surplus, subject to certain restrictions and reporting obligations. These interim changes had an immaterial impact on RBC. The NAIC is developing a long-term solution for this issue.\n•Group Capital Calculation. The NAIC’s group capital calculation (“GCC”) tool uses an RBC aggregation methodology for all entities within an insurance holding company system, including non-U.S. entities. The annual GCC filing requirement is now mandated by the majority of states, including New York, our lead state regulator, and most of our U.S. subsidiaries’ domiciliary states. We cannot predict what impact this regulatory tool may have on our business.\nInvestments\nState insurance laws and regulations limit how much our U.S. insurance subsidiaries can invest in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income securities, real estate equity, other equity investments, and derivatives, and require diversification of investment portfolios. Investments exceeding regulatory limitations are not admitted for purposes of measuring surplus. In some instances, laws require us to divest any non-qualifying investments.\nThe NAIC is focused on enhancing regulatory oversight of insurers’ investments in complex assets, such as structured securities. In connection with evaluating the risks of investing in leveraged loans and CLOs, the NAIC Purposes and Procedures Manual provides that the NAIC Structured Securities Group (“SSG”) will assign risk weights to CLOs using its own modeling rather than credit ratings. The SSG will model CLO investments and evaluate tranche-level losses across all debt tranches under various collateral stress scenarios to minimize RBC arbitrage. The NAIC’s goal is to ensure that the aggregate RBC factor for owning all tranches of a CLO is similar to that required for owning all of the underlying loan collateral. Insurers are required to begin reporting the financially modeled NAIC designations for CLOs with their year-end 2025 financial statement filings. The NAIC is collaborating with interested parties to refine the process for modeling CLO investments.\nIn addition, many of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries and pension companies are subject to other investment laws and regulations. \nReserves and Asset Adequacy Analysis\nThe NAIC’s valuation manual contains a principle-based approach to the calculation of life insurance reserves. Principle-based reserving, which is designed to better address reserving for life insurance and annuity products, has been adopted by all states. \nIn early 2024, the NAIC launched an initiative to address declines in reserve requirements following certain offshore reinsurance transactions, which could lead the NAIC to propose higher reserve requirements for cedants that are parties to certain offshore reinsurance treaties. \nWe use capital markets solutions through captives to fund a portion of our statutory reserve requirements for several products, such as level premium term life products and MLIC’s closed block, which are subject to the NAIC’s Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX), and universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees subject to NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (commonly referred to as Guideline AXXX). NAIC Actuarial Guideline 48 (“AG 48”) enhances the statutory financial statement disclosure of an insurer's use of captives and narrows permissible assets backing statutory reserves. The NAIC’s Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation codifies the same substantive requirements as AG 48. States must either adopt the model regulation or use AG 48 to satisfy the NAIC accreditation requirement.\nEach year a qualified actuary must submit an opinion stating that the statutory reserves of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated captive reinsurers, make adequate provision, according to accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows required by the contractual obligations and related expenses of such subsidiary. We may increase reserves in order to submit this opinion without qualification. \nIn addition, the NYDFS issues SCLs to New York-licensed insurance companies, including MLIC, that affect year-end asset adequacy testing. An SCL could mandate assumption changes that would require us to increase, or influence our decision to release, certain asset adequacy reserves, which could materially impact our statutory capital and surplus. See “Statutory Equity and Income” in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMany of our non-U.S. insurance operations must also analyze the adequacy of their statutory reserves. In most of those cases, a locally qualified actuary must submit an adequacy analysis, although regulatory and actuarial analytic standards vary widely. \nAdjusting Non-Guaranteed Elements of Life Insurance Products\nNew York’s Insurance Regulation 210 sets standards for the determination and any readjustment of non-guaranteed elements (“NGEs”) that may vary at the insurer’s discretion for life insurance policies and annuity contracts delivered or issued for delivery in New York. NGEs include cost of insurance for universal life insurance policies, as well as interest crediting rates for annuities and universal life insurance policies. The regulation requires insurers to notify policyholders in advance of any change in NGEs that is adverse to policyholders and, with respect to life insurance, to notify the NYDFS prior to any such changes. The regulation generally prohibits insurers from increasing profit margins for in-force policies or adjusting NGEs in order to recoup past losses.\nGuaranty Associations\nMany jurisdictions require our insurance subsidiaries to participate in guaranty associations that pay insurance benefits owed by insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments on member insurers based on the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer engaged. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate.\nCertain Non-U.S. Regulations\nRegulators supervise our non-U.S. insurance and pension businesses through periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority along with European legislation, requires European regulators, such as the Central Bank of Ireland, to establish supervisory forums for European Economic Area (“EEA”)-based insurance groups with significant European operations, including MetLife. These forums facilitate cooperation and coordination among European supervisors to enhance their understanding of an insurance group’s risk profile.\nNon-U.S. jurisdictions also restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions from subsidiaries and remittances from branches. For example, a portion of the annual earnings of our Japan operations may be repatriated each year, and may further be distributed to MetLife, Inc. as a dividend. We may determine not to repatriate profits from the Japan operations or to repatriate a reduced amount in order to maintain or improve the solvency of the Japan operations or for other reasons. In addition, the Financial Services Agency in Japan (“FSA”) may limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers would be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of our Japan operations or for other reasons.\nSolvency Regimes\nOur EEA insurance business is subject to the Solvency II Directive, governing capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting. Solvency II harmonizes insurance regulation across the European Union (“EU”). Its capital requirements are forward-looking and based on the risk profile of each individual insurance company in order to promote comparability, transparency and competitiveness.\nThe U.K. and EU have completed reviews of their solvency regimes. The new U.K. rules were effective at the end of 2024. For the EU, we expect detailed guidance to be completed in 2025, with compliance beginning in 2027.\nMexico has adopted a Solvency II-type regulatory framework which imposes reserve and capital requirements and corporate governance to foster transparency. In line with the requirements of the local Solvency II, insurance companies calculate and report their capital requirement using a standard formula designed by the local regulators (“CNSF”). In addition, as required, certain MetLife entities must submit annual Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) reports to the CNSF on an ongoing basis. \nIn Chile, the law implementing Solvency II-like regulation continues in the studies stage. The implementation date for the new solvency regime has not yet been set; however, it could be in force within four years after the final regulation is published. MetLife Chile must also submit an annual ORSA report to the regulator.\nThe Brazilian insurance regulator has established an insurance framework for minimum capital requirements based on risk, criteria for investment activities, a formal risk management function, and a formal enterprise risk management (“ERM”) framework.\nJapanese law requires insurers to maintain solvency standards to protect policyholders and to support their own financial strength. Most Japanese life insurers maintain a solvency margin ratio well in excess of the legally mandated minimum. In addition, we expect Japan to adopt an economic value-based solvency regime in 2025.\nIn China, the business of our joint venture (as well as the industry) has implemented China Risk Oriented Solvency System (“C-ROSS”), a risk-based solvency regime. Like Solvency II, C-ROSS focuses on risk management and has three pillars (strengthen quantitative capital requirements, enhance qualitative supervision and establish a governance and market discipline process). In 2021, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (“CBIRC”) issued C-ROSS Phase II rules, further enhancing the C-ROSS system. CBIRC has adopted a transition period approach based on actual circumstances, with full implementation to be in place by no later than 2026. In 2023, China’s State Council created the National Financial Regulatory Administration (“NFRA”) to oversee regulation of the financial sector. NFRA has replaced its predecessor, CBIRC.\nKorea’s Financial Supervisory Service implemented a new solvency system in 2023. This system reflects the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) global Insurance Capital Standard and incorporates certain product portfolio and other features specific to the Korean market and includes mark-to-market valuation.\nIAIS\nThe IAIS is a voluntary membership association of insurance supervisors and regulators. It is the global standard-setting body responsible for developing and assisting in the implementation of principles, standards and guidance, as well as supporting material, for the supervision of the insurance sector. As a member of the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), the IAIS helps to manage systemic risk globally. The IAIS’s holistic framework assesses and mitigates systemic risk in the global insurance sector. The framework monitors vulnerabilities at jurisdictional and global levels to address any such risk through the application of enhanced supervisory measures based on existing insurance core principles and the common framework for supervision of IAIGs. In 2022, the FSB endorsed this framework and stopped designating global systemically important insurers.\nAn IAIS proposal becomes effective when it is enacted through legislation or regulation in the applicable jurisdiction. Accordingly, the impact on MetLife, Inc. of the IAIS’s global proposals is uncertain.\nCybersecurity, Privacy and Data Protection, and Innovation and Technology Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations at the local, state, federal and international levels regarding the handling of personal information, including health-related and customer information and employee data. Various laws in the U.S. and globally require companies such as ours to inform individuals of their privacy rights. Our personal information processing practices further dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we may transfer, process or receive personal information, the interpretation and scope of which are constantly evolving and vary significantly across jurisdictions. Furthermore, we must comply with laws and regulations governing the security and integrity of our information systems, many of which require comprehensive information security programs, and mandatory notifications to affected individuals and regulators in the event of security breaches and other cyber incidents. Increasing cybersecurity risks and threats from various actors have increased regulatory focus on cybersecurity practices, and regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and cybersecurity continues to increase worldwide. Below, we highlight some of the key data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations to which we are subject.\nCybersecurity\nThe NYDFS promulgated the New York Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies (the “Regulation”) to promote the protection of customer information and information technology. Entities under the NYDFS’s jurisdiction, such as our insurance entities licensed in New York, must conduct risk assessments of their information systems and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such systems and data. The Regulation mandates, among other things: (i) technical safeguards and controls relating to the governance framework for a cybersecurity program; (ii) risk-based policies, procedures and minimum standards for technology systems for data protection; (iii) minimum standards for cyber breach responses, including notice to the NYDFS of certain material events; (iv) designation of a Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”); (v) oversight of third party service providers; and (vi) identification and documentation of material deficiencies, remediation plans and annual certifications of regulatory compliance. Covered entities that fail to comply with the Regulation may be subject to NYDFS enforcement actions, the result of which could lead to civil penalties, and other legal and reputational costs.\nIn 2023, the NYDFS adopted amendments to the Regulation, including: (a) implementing additional governance and oversight measures; (b) expanding the types of cybersecurity events that require timely notification to the NYDFS; (c) mandating notifications to the NYDFS within 24 hours of a cyber-ransom payment; and (d) requiring enhancements to written policies and procedures related to remote access, vulnerability management, data retention and access privileges. The majority of the new requirements became effective in 2024. We cannot predict what effect the amended Regulation will have on our business or compliance costs.\nThe NAIC’s Insurance Data Security Model Law (the “Cybersecurity Model Law”) requires insurers to develop and maintain a risk-based information security program, establish data security standards and notify insurance commissioners of certain cybersecurity events. Certain of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states have adopted the Cybersecurity Model Law, and more may adopt it in the future. Additional compliance efforts may present an increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nIn the U.S., we are subject to state laws imposing obligations on the processing of personal information and providing consumers specific rights over such information. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires covered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers about such companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices and gives California residents expanded rights with respect to the processing of their personal information. In 2020, the CCPA was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, imposing additional rights and obligations. While a significant portion of our business is exempted from the CCPA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other state insurance laws to which we are subject grant similar rights to insureds.\nAdditional states either have proposed or adopted new comprehensive privacy laws, which may apply to certain portions of our business. However, several of these state laws include broad entity-wide exemptions for financial institutions. The NAIC is also developing amendments to update its Privacy of Consumer Financial and Health Information Regulation (Model 672). The proposed amendments, which are expected to be finalized in 2025, are expected to expand the definition of nonpublic personal information; add consumer rights to request access, correction and deletion of nonpublic personal information; and add requirements for contracts with third-party service providers. \nOutside of the U.S., our subsidiaries are subject to various data protection regimes, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”), which imposes strict requirements for controllers and processors of personal data and on transfers of personal data outside of the EEA to countries which have not been deemed “adequate” by the European Commission.\nFollowing the U.K.’s exit from the EU, data privacy law in the U.K. includes the GDPR as assimilated (formally retained) in U.K. law. The interpretation of the U.K. GDPR may eventually start to differ from the GDPR, and ensuring compliance with each is, and will remain, an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs. We are also subject to increasingly restrictive laws in other jurisdictions that address and impose strict requirements on cross-border data transfers.\nInnovation and Technology\nAs a result of increased innovation and technology, the NAIC and insurance regulators are focused on the use of “big data” techniques, such as the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning and automated decision-making. In 2023, the NAIC’s Innovation, Cybersecurity and Technology (H) Committee (the “(H) Committee”) adopted the Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers (the “AI Bulletin”). States have started to adopt the AI Bulletin, which outlines how insurance regulators should govern the development, acquisition and use of AI technologies, as well as the types of information that regulators may request during an investigation or examination of an insurer in regard to AI systems. The (H) Committee has also formed a new task force that is charged with creating a regulatory framework for the oversight of insurers’ use of third-party data and models.\nFurther, the NAIC and state insurance regulators have been focused on addressing unfair discrimination in the use of consumer data and technology, and some states have passed laws targeting unfair discrimination practices. In 2024, the NYDFS released its circular letter, which applies to all authorized insurers in New York, such as MLIC and Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company. The circular letter provides guidance on how insurers should develop and manage their use of external consumer data and AI systems in underwriting and pricing so as not to harm consumers.\nWe expect big data and AI technologies to remain important issues for the NAIC and state and international regulators. We cannot predict which insurance regulators will adopt the AI Bulletin, or what, if any, changes to laws or regulations may be enacted with regard to “big data” or AI technologies in the U.S. or outside of the U.S. For example, the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (“EU AI Act”) became effective in 2024. Among other things, the EU AI Act prohibits certain “unacceptable” AI practices while seeking to boost innovation and ensure fundamental rights are not infringed by the technology. We continue to monitor the developments of the EU AI Act and other governmental initiatives around the world, particularly in jurisdictions where we operate.\nStandards of Conduct, ERISA, Fiduciary Considerations, and Other Pension and Retirement Regulation\nWe provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). ERISA and the Code impose restrictions, including fiduciary duties to perform solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and to avoid prohibited non-exempt transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by the U.S. Department of Labor (the “DOL”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\nThe prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to ERISA plans and participants and to Individual Retirement Accounts (and certain other arrangements) if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to an individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen, unless an exemption or exception is available. Similarly, without an exemption or exception, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future.\nIn 2021, the DOL’s final version of the prohibited transaction exemption (“PTE”) 2020-02 went into effect, which allows investment advice fiduciaries to receive compensation without violating ERISA, subject to impartial conduct standards and disclosure obligations aligned with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules. In the preamble to PTE 2020-02, the DOL also provided its interpretation of the five-part test used to determine whether a person is acting as an ERISA investment advice fiduciary. In April 2024, DOL finalized and published a regulation to change the definition of “fiduciary” for purposes of ERISA and parallel provisions of the Code, when a financial professional, including an insurance producer, provides investment advice, and to amend various existing PTEs that financial professionals rely on when making recommendations. Shortly thereafter, these changes were challenged in court, and in July 2024, two federal district courts entered separate stays of the effective date of the new regulation regarding the definition of “fiduciary” and the amendments to the PTEs, pending further orders of the courts. The DOL has appealed these stay orders. We are evaluating the potential impact of these developments on our business, particularly as it pertains to the sale of insurance, annuity and welfare benefit products to retirement investors. \nFederal and state securities regulators have adopted standards of conduct when recommending securities, including variable insurance products. The SEC’s Regulation Best Interest requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail consumers when recommending account types, securities transactions or investment strategies involving securities, including recommendations to individuals receiving recommendations about their retirement accounts. In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) rules impose requirements on broker-dealers relating to the sale of variable insurance products. \nState regulators and legislatures have proposed measures that would make broker-dealers, sales agents, and investment advisers and their representatives subject to a fiduciary duty when providing products and services to customers. The North American Securities Administrators Association has proposed revisions to its broker-dealer conduct model rule intended to apply Regulation Best Interest at the state level and prohibiting the use of the terms “advisor” or “adviser” without being registered as an investment adviser. Although Regulation Best Interest does not include a private right of action, some of the state proposals and adopted regulations would allow for a private right of action. As a result of these developments, it is possible that it may become more costly to provide and distribute our products and services, and that we might be subject to additional litigation and regulatory investigations regarding our compliance with those rules.\nIn January 2025, the Chilean Congress approved a major pension reform bill, which improves pensions by increasing employer contributions, correcting certain inequalities, raising the guaranteed minimum pension and modifying Chile’s Pension Fund Administrators system to allow new pension fund administrators into the market. The impact of such pension reform on our Chilean pension business is being assessed.\nManagement of Climate Risk and ESG\nClimate risk has come under increased scrutiny by regulators and the NAIC. In New York, the NYDFS expects both New York domestic insurers, such as MLIC, and foreign authorized insurers, such as our other insurance subsidiaries licensed in New York, to manage material climate risks by taking actions that are proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of their businesses. However, the NYDFS issued separate guidance for New York domestic insurers, which contains more detailed expectations, such as (i) ensuring the board of directors understands relevant climate risks; (ii) performing regular reviews of the insurer’s procedures that are designed to manage climate risks; (iii) using scenario analysis to inform the insurer’s business strategies and risk assessment; and (iv) incorporating material climate risks into its financial risk management (e.g., ERM and ORSA). In addition, New York’s regulation governing ERM, which applies to New York domestic and foreign authorized insurers, was amended to require an insurance group’s ERM function to address climate change risk.\nThe NAIC has adopted a standard for insurance companies to report their climate-related risks as part of its annual Climate Risk Disclosure Survey, which applies to insurers that meet the reporting threshold of $100 million in countrywide direct premium and are licensed in one of the participating jurisdictions. The new disclosure standard is consistent with the international Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures’ framework for reporting climate-related financial information. \nPursuant to its authority under Dodd-Frank, the FIO is also assessing how the insurance sector may mitigate climate risks and help achieve national climate-related goals. In 2023, the FIO released a report which urges insurance regulators to adopt climate-related risk-monitoring guidance in order to enhance their regulation and supervision of insurers. \nThe SEC is also focused on climate, and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) risks and opportunities. In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules requiring registrants to provide additional climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports, including in their financial statements. In April 2024, following litigation challenging the final rules, the SEC voluntarily stayed the final rules pending completion of judicial review. In 2022, the SEC also proposed rules requiring registered investment companies, business development companies, and registered and certain unregistered investment advisers to disclose in their fund prospectuses, annual reports and Form ADV information about how funds and advisers incorporate ESG factors into their investment strategies.\nIn 2023, California adopted laws establishing climate disclosure and climate-related financial risk reporting requirements which apply to companies doing business in California that meet applicable revenue thresholds. Also in 2023, California adopted a law establishing disclosure requirements for entities operating within California that market, sell, purchase, or use voluntary carbon offsets, as well as those that make claims of achieving net zero emissions or carbon neutrality that operate within and make such claims within the state. MetLife is in compliance with such requirements.\nThe EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) requires in-scope companies to report on (i) how sustainability issues might create financial risks for the company; and (ii) the company’s impacts on people and the environment. CSRD applies on a staggered basis to companies, over a multi-year period, with the first reports due in 2025 in respect of the 2024 financial year. MetLife’s largest insurance subsidiary in Europe is in scope for this first phase.\nConsumer Protection Laws\nAs part of Dodd-Frank, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction generally exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB does have authority to regulate non-insurance consumer services we provide. Consumer protection laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions may also affect us.\nDerivatives Regulation and Clearing of Treasury Securities\nDodd-Frank includes a framework of regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets requiring clearing of certain OTC derivative transactions and imposes additional costs, including reporting and margin requirements. Centralized clearing also exposes us to the risk of a default by a clearing member or clearinghouse with respect to our cleared derivative transactions. \nDodd-Frank also expanded the definition of “swap” and mandated the SEC and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to study whether “stable value contracts” should be treated as swaps. Pursuant to the definition and the SEC’s and CFTC’s interpretive regulations, products offered by our insurance subsidiaries, other than stable value contracts, might also be treated as swaps. Special federal banking rules apply to certain derivatives contracts and other agreements with some banking institutions and certain of their affiliates. These rules generally limit or delay the rights of counterparties upon the insolvency of such banking institutions which could increase our counterparty risk.\nIn 2024, the principal U.S. federal banking regulatory agencies reproposed for public comment regulations to implement certain international “Basel III” capital standards, which could affect capital charges applicable to banks and their affiliates engaged in derivatives activities. This could increase the costs of our risk mitigation using derivatives, as well as impact the availability of derivatives from our counterparties.\nIn 2023, the SEC adopted rules to require that covered clearing agencies have policies and procedures reasonably designed to require every direct participant of the agency to submit for clearing eligible secondary market transactions in U.S. Treasury securities. The rule effectively requires such participants to clear eligible cash transactions in U.S. Treasury securities beginning on December 31, 2025. Furthermore, the rule effectively requires eligible repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury securities to be cleared beginning on June 30, 2026. As a result, certain transactions between such participants and us will be required to be cleared. The rule’s potential effect on the U.S. Treasury markets is uncertain.\nSecurities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation\nU.S. federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to insurance products that meet the definition of a “security,” including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, and certain fixed interest rate or index-linked contracts with features that require them to be registered as securities or exempt from registration. As a result, some of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under these securities laws.\nFederal and state securities laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered “securities” under local law, and we may be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators.\nSome of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws and regulations administered by the SEC. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies with separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”) or are exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act. Such separate accounts are generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies associated with these separate accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or are exempt from registration under the Securities Act. One of our insurance subsidiaries issues a fixed interest rate contract with features that require it to be registered under the Securities Act.\nCertain variable contract separate accounts sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws.\nTwo of our U.S. subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and are members of, and subject to regulation by, FINRA. The SEC, CFTC and FINRA from time to time propose and adopt rules and regulations that impact broker-dealers and products deemed to be securities. One of our U.S. broker-dealers serves as the principal underwriter and distributor of these variable products and other securities offerings. Our broker-dealer distributes these products via unaffiliated third-party broker-dealers and financial intermediaries that sell these products to end investors. Under SEC rules, these selling broker-dealers are required to comply with various SEC and FINRA rules and regulations, including Regulation Best Interest. SEC rules also require these selling broker-dealers to disclose the nature of services, their standard of conduct, and their conflicts of interest to their retail customers. With regard to insurance products, the NAIC revised its Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation to add a “best interest” standard for the sale of annuities. All of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states have adopted the model regulation or another form of the best interest standard.\nOne of our U.S. subsidiaries is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. In addition, we have non-U.S. subsidiaries that are registered or licensed in non-U.S. jurisdictions to conduct our investment management business. We may also be subject to similar laws and regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions with respect to the provision of investment advisory services or the conducting of other activities.\nFederal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations regarding compliance by MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries with securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.\nDiversity and Corporate Governance\nThe NAIC and state insurance regulators are evaluating issues related to diversity within the insurance industry. In New York, for example, the NYDFS expects insurers to make diversity of their leadership a business priority and a key element of their corporate governance, and it includes diversity-related questions in its examination process.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nAs an owner and operator of real property in many jurisdictions, we are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations in such jurisdictions, as well as the associated risks of environmental liabilities. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies that could potentially be subject to such liabilities. We routinely have environmental assessments performed with respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real property to be acquired through foreclosure. Based on information currently available to us, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of such properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nUnclaimed Property\nWe are subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. See “— State Insurance Regulation,” which references a consent order. See also Note 24 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBrighthouse Separation Tax Treatment\nPrior to the spin-off distribution of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Brighthouse”) common stock in 2017, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain significant issues under the Code, as well as an opinion from tax counsel that the distribution qualified for non-recognition of gain or loss to us and our shareholders pursuant to Sections 355 and 361 of the Code, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares, each subject to the accuracy of and compliance with certain representations, assumptions and covenants therein.\nNotwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the tax opinion, the IRS could determine that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction, for example, if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or covenants on which the private letter ruling is based are untrue or have been violated. Similarly, the IRS could determine that our disposal of the fair value option of Brighthouse Financial, Inc.’s common stock in the debt-for-equity exchange should be treated as a taxable transaction to MetLife, Inc. Furthermore, as part of the IRS’s policy, the IRS did not determine whether the distribution or the debt-for-equity exchange satisfies certain conditions that are necessary to qualify for non-recognition treatment. Rather, the private letter ruling is based on representations by us and Brighthouse that these conditions have been satisfied. The tax opinion addressed the satisfaction of these conditions. The tax opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or a court may take a contrary position. In addition, the tax counsel relied on certain representations and covenants delivered by us and Brighthouse.\nIf the IRS ultimately determines that the distribution is taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to MetLife shareholders who received shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock in the distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and such shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities if the 2017 tax year is still open with respect to such shareholders under the applicable statute of limitation. In addition, if the IRS ultimately determines that the distribution is taxable, we and Brighthouse could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and either we or Brighthouse could have an indemnification obligation to the other, depending on the circumstances.\nEven if the spin-off distribution otherwise qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 of the Code, it may be taxable to us, but not our shareholders, under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more (by vote or value) of our common stock or Brighthouse Financial, Inc.’s common stock is acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution.\nCross-Border Trade and Investments\nThe U.S., the EU and the U.K. maintain and enforce a variety of economic sanctions against designated countries and their nationals around the world, which can result in disruptions in cross-border activity. In particular, U.S., EU and U.K. sanctions on Russia have expanded as a result of the war in Ukraine. These sanctions have expanded restrictions on transactions with the Russian Central Bank and other specified Russian government entities, dealing in Russian sovereign debt, engaging in certain debt and equity transactions, and engaging in transactions related to all new investment in the Russian Federation. Trade and investment in China may also be impacted by U.S. sanctions, outbound investment controls, and tariff policies. The U.S. government has previously issued restrictions targeting certain activity involving specified Chinese securities and technology.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has proposed policies aiming to modernize global tax systems, including a global 15% minimum effective tax rate (“Pillar Two”) for multinational companies, including MetLife. A number of countries have either enacted Pillar Two rules or are evaluating whether to enact such rules. As most of our operations are in jurisdictions with a tax rate above 15%, we do not currently expect these rules to have a material impact on us.\nCompetition \nThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Competitive Pressures.” We face competition based on factors such as service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition, performance against ESG metrics, technology, changes in regulation and taxes and other factors. We compete globally with a large number of insurance companies and non-insurance financial services companies such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers. We compete for individual consumers, employer and other group customers, as well as agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. Some of our competitors offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability ratings. In the U.S. and Japan, we compete with a large number of domestic and foreign-owned life insurance companies, many of which offer products in categories on which we focus. Elsewhere, we compete with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies. Because we and others underwrite many group insurance products annually, our group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than renewing coverage with us.\nInsurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. They are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue focusing on monetization of assets, and fee-based services. They are also looking for opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions which include value-added services along with traditional products.\nFinancial market volatility will impact insurers’ capital positions, which may strain the competitive environment and lead to industry consolidation. We believe adaptability to market changes, as well as financial strength, technological efficiency and organizational agility, will most significantly differentiate competitors in our industry. We believe we are well positioned to succeed in any environment. \nThe Company distributes many of its products through a variety of third-party distribution channels, including banks and broker-dealers. We believe potential distribution partners carefully consider the financial strength of the company whose products they sell. Bank and broker-dealer consolidation could increase competition for access to distributors. \nWe face intense competition for employees. We must attract and retain highly skilled people with knowledge of our business and industry experience to support our business. See “— Human Capital Resources.” We continue to seek to grow our career agency forces in selected global markets. We also continue efforts to enhance the efficiency and production of our sales representatives. These initiatives may not succeed in attracting and retaining productive agents. See “— Segments and Corporate & Other” for information on sales distribution.\nNumerous aspects of our business are heavily regulated. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can affect our competitive position within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See “— Regulation.”\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2024, we had approximately 45,000 employees. \nAs a financial services company, meeting our business objectives requires that we rely significantly on our global workforce, leveraging a wide variety of professional, technical, management, business, and other skills and expertise, to create value for our stakeholders. Our priorities include a purpose driven and inclusive culture, talent and skill development, benefits and wellbeing, compensation, and attracting and retaining talent. These factors impact the readiness of the organization to support business needs. \n•Purpose driven and inclusive culture: We cultivate a purpose driven and inclusive culture that serves as a driving force for meeting our business objectives through:\n◦Global forums where executive and senior leaders across the organization connect to further shape and align to our strategy, build capabilities and provide feedback on our operations, culture and future;\n◦Let’s Talk Live! monthly, Chief Executive Officer-driven global town halls where information is shared with all employees and employees are given the opportunity to ask questions of leadership;\n◦MyVoice, MetLife’s annual employee survey that provides our employees with an opportunity to share their perspectives and informs action-oriented solutions; and \n◦Speak Up, MetLife’s online tool that, together with its Ethics & Fraud Hotline, enable associates to report any concern or violation that impacts employees, customers, or MetLife, without fear of retaliation.\n◦MetLife Foundation that supports a broad range of volunteerism efforts aimed at addressing the needs our communities.\n•Talent and skill development: Through our Growing@MetLife campaign, employees can leverage our digitally enabled learning platform known as MyLearning, our AI Academy to learn about the responsible use of AI through courses and other resources, and our internal global talent marketplace known as MyPath to enhance and expand their skills through experiential and cross-functional learning. To further personalize employee development, our Coaching@MetLife program certifies employees globally as internal coaches. Coaching sessions have focused on topics including skills development, career exploration, problem solving and job transitions.\n•Benefits and wellbeing: We offer to our employees compensation and inclusive benefits programs that provide resources to help maintain their physical, mental and financial wellbeing, as well as guidance to pursue development opportunities and learning experiences that are tailored to individual career aspirations. MetLife’s company-paid and company-subsidized healthcare, disability, life insurance and retirement benefits are tailored to the needs of each market and competitive paid time off, as well as parental leave programs, are provided in all markets.\n•Compensation: We have a pay-for-performance philosophy that directly links an employee’s compensation to their performance and to MetLife’s performance. We also provide market-aligned compensation opportunities to attract, motivate, engage and retain talent and are committed to continuing to review our practices.\n•Attracting and retaining talent: We provide a talent relationship management platform to help employees and potential employees find positions at MetLife that align to their career interests. We enable career development and training for existing employees by giving them access to tools, resources and forums that expand professional relationships. We support retention of our employees through a variety of means, such as maintaining employee recognition programs, focusing on employee health and wellness, and offering our total compensation and benefit programs.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nSet forth below is information regarding the executive officers of MetLife, Inc.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors \nAny or each of the events described below may (or may continue to) adversely affect the global economy or global financial markets, or our reputation, regulatory, customer, or other relationships, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows, statutory capital position, ability to meet our obligations, credit and financial strength ratings, financial condition, or the market price of our common stock. The effects may vary depending on timing, product, market, region or segment.\nMany of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of any of them may cause others to emerge or worsen. Such combinations could materially increase the severity of the cumulative or separate impact of these risks.\nThese risk factors do not describe all potential risks that could affect MetLife. You should carefully consider the risk factors together with other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Business,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and other reports and materials MetLife submits to the SEC.\nEconomic Environment and Capital Markets Risks\nWe May Face Difficult Economic Conditions\nMarket factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, declining equity or debt markets, derivative prices and availability, real estate conditions, foreign currency exchange rates, consumer and government spending, government default or spending reductions to avoid default, business investment, climate change, public health risks, volatility, disruptions and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation, and government actions in response thereto, may inhibit revenue growth, reduce investment opportunities and result in reduced investment returns or losses, derivative losses, reductions in fees generated, changes in insurance liabilities, impairments, increased valuation allowances, increases in reserves, reduced net investment income and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions.\nHigher unemployment, changes to inflation, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, greater government regulation, lower business investment, lower consumer spending, elevated incidence of claims, adverse utilization of benefits relative to our best estimate expectations, lapses or surrenders of policies, reduced demand for our products, and deferred or canceled payments of insurance premiums may negatively affect our earnings and capitalization.\nInterest Rate Risks\nSome of our products and investments expose us to interest rate risks, including changes in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, which may reduce or eliminate our investment spread and net income.\nInterest rate increases may harm our profitability. During rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates required to stay competitive. This could result in a lower spread, lower profitability, decreased sales, and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This may result in cash outflows requiring the sale of investments on less favorable terms, resulting in investment losses and reductions in net income. Reductions in net income may in turn harm our credit instrument covenants and rating agency assessment of our financial condition. Interest rate increases may harm the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair value of fixed income securities, and may increase our daily settlement payments on interest rate futures and cleared swaps, resulting in increased cash outflows and liquidity needs. Furthermore, if interest rates rise, our unrealized gains on fixed income securities may decrease and our unrealized losses may increase. We would recognize the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these fixed income securities in net income upon a sale, an intent to sell, a determination it is more likely than not we will be required to sell, or if the decline in estimated fair value is due to a credit loss. During inflationary periods with rising interest rates, the value of fixed income investments falls, which could increase realized and unrealized losses, resulting in additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable. Finally, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.\nLow interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or a period of sustained low market yields, we may incur significant losses due to, among other reasons, losses incurred in our general account and/or the impact of guarantees, including increases in liabilities, capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, during periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative. Reductions in net income from these factors may in turn harm our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition.\nDuring periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to increase our reserves.\nThe measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating the sensitivity of our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities, may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, we may not be able to invest assets at the full liability duration, thereby creating some asset/liability mismatch. In addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders’ equity because we record our non-qualified derivatives at fair value through earnings, while certain hedged items may follow an accrual-based accounting model or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.\nCredit Spread Risks\nChanges in credit spreads may result in market price volatility and cash flow variability. Market price volatility may result in defaults and a lack of pricing transparency, and can make valuations of our securities difficult if trading becomes less frequent, which may require us to add to our reserves. An increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks may increase our borrowing costs and decrease certain product fee income. A sustained decrease in credit spreads could reduce the yield on our future investments. The discount rate used to calculate liabilities for future policy benefits includes a component for market credit spreads that does not necessarily align to our investment spreads. Changes in market credit spreads could result in volatility to liabilities for future policy benefits relative to our asset values.\nEquity Risks\nDownturns and volatility in equity markets may harm our savings and investment products’ revenues and investment returns, where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of our managed assets. Our variable annuity and life insurance business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets may decrease these products’ revenues and earnings. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity and life products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline or stagnate.\nSustained declines in long-term equity returns or interest rates may harm the funding of our pension plans and other post-retirement benefit obligations. An increase in equity markets could increase settlement payments on equity futures and total rate of return swaps (“TRRs”), which may increase our cash outflows and liquidity needs.\nThe timing of distributions from and valuations of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds, real estate ventures, real estate funds and other private equity funds depends on the performance of the underlying investments, distribution schedules, and the funds’ need for cash, which may differ from performance of public equity markets, which drives performance of our equity hedges. The amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period and significant volatility may harm our returns and net investment income. In addition, downturns or volatility in the equity markets may decrease the estimated fair value of our alternative investments and equity securities.\nReal Estate Risks\nChanges in leasable commercial space supply and demand, lessee behaviors, pandemics and other public health issues, creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital markets volatility, interest rate fluctuations, commodity prices, farm incomes, housing and commercial property market conditions, and real estate investment supply and demand may adversely impact our investments in commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and real estate equity investments including joint ventures.\nPolitical, Obligor and Counterparty Risks\nOur general account investments in certain countries could be adversely affected by volatility resulting from local economic and political concerns, as well as volatility in specific sectors. Government entities may face budget deficits and other financial difficulties, which may harm the value of securities we hold issued by or under the auspices of such governments. In the U.S., a threat facing the economy is the continued disagreement over the federal debt limit, other budget questions, and potential restrictions on trade with other markets. Failure to resolve these issues in a timely manner could result in a government shutdown, erratic reduction in government spending or a default on government debt, which could result in increased market volatility and reduced economic activity.\nThe issuers or guarantors of fixed income securities and mortgage loans we own may more frequently default on principal and interest payments they owe us. Additionally, the change in value of underlying collateral within instruments backed by securitized assets may result in a default on principal and interest payments, reducing our cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, or other adverse events may increase the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio.\nMany of our transactions with counterparties expose us to the risk of counterparty default. Such credit risk may be exacerbated if we cannot realize on the collateral held by us in secured transactions or cannot liquidate such collateral at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Furthermore, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks’ credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them.\nOur efforts to manage our total exposure to a single counterparty or limited number of counterparties within or among any of our investment, derivative, treasury, and reinsurance relationships, which we adjust from time to time, may not completely or adequately mitigate counterparty risks.\nCurrency Exchange Rate Risks\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, net income from non-U.S. operations and issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated instruments. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also make certain of our products less attractive to customers, which may increase levels of early policy terminations and decrease sales volume and our in-force business. Such negative effects may be exacerbated if international markets experience severe economic or financial disruptions or significant currency devaluations, if a foreign economy is determined to be “highly inflationary,” or if a country withdraws from the Eurozone. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our operations, earnings or investments in the affected countries.\nWe may be unable to mitigate the risk of such changes in exchange rates due to unhedged positions, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting resulting from derivative gains (losses) on non-qualifying hedges, the failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation, or other factors. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the translation of results into our U.S. dollar basis consolidated financial statements.\nDerivatives Risks\nIf our counterparties, clearing brokers or central clearinghouses fail or refuse to honor their obligations under our derivatives agreements, our risks may not be fully hedged. A counterparty, clearing broker, or central clearinghouse may become insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling to make payments or to return collateral under the terms of derivatives agreements, increasing our costs or resulting in significant losses. If the net estimated fair value of a derivative to which we are a party declines, we may need to pledge additional collateral or make increased payments. In addition, we may face increased costs to the extent we replace counterparties or clearing brokers who suffer financial difficulties. Furthermore, our derivatives valuations may change based on changes to our valuation methodology or errors in such valuation or valuation methodology.\nTerrorism and Security Risks\nThe continued threat of terrorism, ongoing or potential military conflict and other actions, and heightened security measures may cause economic uncertainty and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. The value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by such threats. Companies in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of financial, commercial or economic disruptions, and such disruptions might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or principal on their securities or mortgage loans. Terrorist or military actions also could disrupt our operations centers and result in higher than anticipated claims under our insurance policies.\nWe May Not Meet Our Liquidity Needs, Access Capital, or May Face Significantly Increased Cost of Capital Due to Adverse Capital and Credit Market Conditions\nIn cases of volatility, disruption, or other conditions in global financial markets, we may have to seek additional financing, the availability and cost of which could be adversely affected by market conditions, regulatory considerations, availability of credit to our industry generally, our credit ratings and credit capacity, reduced business activity, or investment losses, and the perception of our financial prospects. Our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. We may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing we need on favorable terms or at all. We may be required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice under securities lending or derivatives agreements or post collateral or make payments related to specified counterparty agreements.\nOur business and financial results may suffer without sufficient liquidity through impaired ability to pay claims, other operating expenses, interest on our debt, dividends on our capital stock, cash or collateral to our subsidiaries, maintain our securities lending, replace certain maturing liabilities, sustain our operations and investments, and repurchase our common stock. Capital and credit market volatility may limit our access to capital we need to operate or grow our business, issue the types of securities we would prefer, timely replace maturing liabilities, or satisfy regulatory requirements, any of which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.\nWe May Be Unable to Access Our Credit Facility, Reducing Our Liquidity and Leading to Downgrades in Our Credit and Financial Strength Ratings \nWe may fail to comply with or fulfill all conditions under the unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding, Inc. maintain. Lenders may fail to fund their lending commitments under the Credit Facility due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons. \nWe May Lose Business Due to a Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or Credit Ratings\nNationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (“NRSROs”) and others may, at any time, downgrade our financial strength ratings or credit ratings, lower our ratings outlooks, increase the scope or frequency of their reviews, or increase capital or other requirements to maintain ratings. Such changes could reduce our product sales, reduce cash flows from funding agreements and other capital market products, and force us to change product pricing and increase our financing costs, policy surrenders or withdrawals, collateral requirements, risk of derivative terminations, cost of reinsurance, regulatory scrutiny, or various other factors.\nWe May Not Find Available, Affordable or Adequate Reinsurance to Protect Us Against Losses\nReinsurers may increase our reinsurance costs, or may decline to offer us reinsurance, due to policy changes related to public health issues, market conditions, or other factors. Our risk of loss may increase if we decrease the amount of our reinsurance. Any of these could harm our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue.\nWe remain liable and may incur costs as the direct insurer on all risks we reinsure as a result of a reinsurer’s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments, or inability or unwillingness to maintain collateral, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings Costs May Increase, and We May Find Limited Market Capacity for New Financings\nIf MetLife’s ratings decline, market capacity is limited, or on other repricing occasions, our costs to finance statutory life insurance reserves may increase. If regulators disallow assets to back statutory reserves, we would not be able to take some or all related statutory reserve credit, which may harm the statutory capitalization of certain of our insurance subsidiaries.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nChanges in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us\nInsurance or other regulators may change licensing, permit, or approval requirements, or take other actions harmful to us. They may also take actions that harm our customers and independent sales intermediaries or their operations, which may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products.\nGovernments may change regulation of financial services, insurance, variable annuities and variable life insurance, securities, derivatives, pension, health care, accounting, cybersecurity, AI, privacy and data protection, tort reform, taxation, benefit plan investment advice and related fiduciary duties, antitrust as applied to the business of health insurance or otherwise, and other areas. Laws and regulations may also affect customers, sales intermediaries, or others. We or others may fail to comply with these requirements or suffer adverse regulatory examinations or audits. Regulators and courts may also interpret rules differently from the way we have, or change interpretations of laws or rules, and legislators may change statutes. Any of these changes may harm our ability to continue to offer the products we do today or to introduce new products.\nWe may incur costs to comply with laws and regulations and changes to these laws and regulations may increase our expenses and regulatory capital charges. Our failure to comply with our own policies or with regulatory requirements may harm our reputation or result in sanctions or legal claims.\nLaws, regulations or regulatory actions may limit or change the type, amount or structure of compensation or benefits we offer our employees or others, or may limit or ban the use of non-competition agreements, which may harm our ability to compete in recruiting and retaining key personnel. We may also fail to fulfill our fiduciary or other benefit-related obligations completely.\nCompliance with solvency standards or financial condition regulations may increase our capital and reserve requirements, risk management costs, and reporting costs. See “Business — Regulation — State Insurance Regulation — Surplus and Capital” for a summary of the NAIC’s developments related to financial condition regulation. We may be subject to enhanced capital standards, supervision and additional requirements, such as group capital standards or insurer capital standards. MetLife, Inc. could be compelled to undergo FDIC liquidation if it becomes insolvent or is in danger of defaulting on its obligations, potentially imposing greater losses on shareholders and unsecured creditors than under the Bankruptcy Code. This could also apply to financial institutions whose debt we hold and could harm the value of our holdings. We could be assessed charges in connection with a financial company liquidation.\nOur ability to react to rapidly changing economic conditions and the dynamic, competitive markets may be impaired if our product designs do not allow frequent and contemporaneous revisions of key pricing elements, or if we are unable to work collaboratively with regulators. Changes in regulatory approval processes, rules and other dynamics in the regulatory process could harm our ability to react to such changing conditions. Rules on defined benefit pension plan funding may reduce the likelihood or delay corporate plan sponsors in terminating their plans or engaging in transactions to partially or fully transfer pension obligations. This could affect the mix of our pension risk transfers and increase non-guaranteed funding products.\nGovernmental bodies may delay acting on or implementing regulatory or policy changes due to circumstances outside of our control, including, but not limited to, public health issues. Such delays may increase uncertainty, prolong deleterious regulations and policies, delay or prevent beneficial regulatory or policy changes, and create the potential for later, more rapid changes to which we may find it more difficult to adjust.\nOur New York insurance regulator’s annual SCL for year-end asset adequacy testing may impose unforeseen assumptions or requirements that require us to increase or release reserves, which could affect our statutory capital and surplus.\nGovernments or Others May Increase our Taxes by Changing or Re-Interpreting Tax Laws, Making Some of Our Products Less Attractive to Consumers\nChanges in tax laws or interpretations of such laws could increase our corporate taxes, reduce our earnings, and adjust the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Changes may increase our effective tax rate or have implications that make our products less attractive to consumers. Tax authorities may enact laws, change regulations to increase existing taxes, or add new types of taxes, and authorities who have not imposed taxes in the past may impose taxes.\nCustomers shifting away from employee benefits, life insurance and annuity contracts, or other tax-preferred products would reduce our income from these products and our asset base, reducing our earnings and potentially affecting the value of our deferred tax assets.\nWe May Face Increasing Litigation and Regulatory Investigations\nLegal or regulatory actions, inquiries or investigations, involving us or our competitors, whether ongoing or yet to come, could harm our reputation, ability to attract or retain customers or employees, and business, financial condition, or results of operations, even if we or our competitors, ultimately prevail. Regulators or private parties may bring class actions, individual suits, or investigations seeking large recoveries and alleging wrongs relating to matters such as sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, failure to adequately or appropriately supervise, inappropriate compensation contrary to licensing requirements, product design, disclosure, administration, investments, denial or delay of benefits, pandemic- or other public health-related practices, privacy and data protection, or data security incidents, discriminatory or inequitable practices, and breaches of fiduciary or other duties. We may be unable to anticipate the outcome of a litigation or an investigation and the amount or range of loss, including with respect to our reputation, because we do not know how adversaries, fact finders, courts, regulators, or others will evaluate evidence, the law, or accounting principles, and whether they will do so differently than we have.\nOur Efforts to Meet Environmental, Social, and Governance Standards and to Enhance the Sustainability of our Businesses May Not Meet Investors', Regulators' or Customers' Expectations\nSome of our shareholders, investors and customers, or those considering such a relationship with us, evaluate our business or other practices according to a variety of ESG standards and expectations. Our practices and performance are subject to increasing scrutiny with regard to various aspects of ESG performance from regulators and other stakeholders.\nOur investors or others may evaluate our practices by ESG criteria that are continually evolving and not always clear or readily measurable. These standards and expectations may also, as a whole, reflect contrasting or conflicting values or agendas and are not always susceptible to consensus. Our decisions and priorities must also necessarily, and simultaneously, take account of multiple business goals and interests. Our practices may not change in the particulars or at the rate some stakeholders expect. As a result, our efforts to conduct our business in accordance with some or all these expectations may involve trade-offs. In June 2022, we announced our commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 2050 or sooner. This commitment applies to GHG emissions from our global owned and leased offices and vehicle fleets, employee business travel, supply chain and general account investment portfolio, including the general accounts of MetLife, Inc.’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, where reliable data and methodologies are available. We have oriented our climate objectives and interim targets to advance this commitment, which involves assumptions and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Data and measurement techniques continue to evolve. Further, because of the financed emissions included in our investment portfolio, our ability to meet our commitments is dependent on those counterparties meeting their own carbon reduction objectives. We may fail to meet our commitments or targets, and our policies and processes to evaluate and manage ESG standards in coordination with other business priorities may not prove completely effective or fully satisfy expectations of some stakeholders. For example, some current customers and potential customers may decline to do business with us based on our sustainability practices and related policies and actions. We may also face adverse regulatory, investor, media, or public scrutiny leading to business, reputational, or legal challenges.\nCapital Risks\nWe May Not be Able to Pay Dividends or Repurchase Our Stock Due to Legal and Regulatory Restrictions or Cash Buffer Needs\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, as well as regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries, general market conditions, the market price of our common stock compared to management’s assessment of the stock’s underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, other legal and accounting factors, and any other factors our Board deems relevant may preclude us from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock.\nOther factors may affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. Governments, investors or media may pressure us not to repurchase shares of our common stock or other securities, or prohibit us from doing so. Our use of other means to return excess capital to shareholders may be less tax-efficient than repurchases. We maintain a buffer of cash and other liquid assets, and may increase it. As a result, we may have less capital to devote to other uses, such as innovation, acquisitions, development and return of capital to shareholders. We may also be restricted from repurchasing shares or entering into share repurchase programs at times, such as when we are aware of material non-public information.\nIf we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock or pay interest on our junior subordinated debentures or trust securities, terms of those instruments may restrict our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures or other securities.\nOur Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. MetLife, Inc. may also not meet its free cash flow or shareholder cash distribution goals.\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required if they determine payments could be adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. Business conditions, rating agency considerations, taxation, dividend and repatriation rules, and monetary transfer and foreign currency exchange rules may limit our insurance subsidiaries’ dividends and other payments. We may need to transfer capital among our companies to comply with net worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\nInvestment Risks\nWe May Face Defaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events That Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold\nIn case of a major economic downturn, U.S. government default (or threatened default), acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events, our estimated fair value of our fixed income securities and loan portfolios and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default rate of our investment portfolio may increase. These changes could harm the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels if securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fixed income securities may increase our write-downs or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property type may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the prices we can obtain when we sell assets, and our results of operations or financial condition. Legislation or regulations that would allow or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans or other investments could harm our investment portfolio.\nMajor public health issues have affected and may continue to affect financial markets and our investment portfolio. These may continue to contribute to our risk of investment defaults, downgrades and volatility, asset impairments and lower variable investment income and returns, and may cause or exacerbate any of the investment risks we describe in these risk factors.\nMarket volatility affects the value of or return on our investments. It may slow or prevent us from reacting to market events as effectively as we otherwise could. When we sell our investment holdings, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value, due to reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption, or other reasons. Borrowers may delay or fail to pay principal and interest when due, or may demand loan modifications. Tenants may delay paying rent, or fail to pay it, or demand lease modifications. We may face moratoriums on foreclosures and other enforcement actions, impairments, and loan or lease modifications, due to government action or market conditions. We may also encounter credit spread changes, increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our product fee income. Issuer or guarantor default rates may increase.\nWe May Have Difficulty Selling Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner to Realize Their Full Value\nWhen we sell holdings in our investment portfolio, we may not receive the price we seek and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value. We may face unfavorable conditions in privately-placed fixed income securities, private structured credit, certain derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, direct financing and leveraged leases, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, private equity, and real estate equity, including real estate joint ventures and funds. Our investments may suffer reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption or for other reasons. In addition, central banks' efforts to provide market liquidity or otherwise address market conditions may not be successful or sufficient. We may realize losses that harm our financial metrics, which could harm our compliance with our credit requirements and rating agency capital adequacy measures.\nWe may face similar risks if we are required under our securities lending program to return significant amounts of cash collateral that we have invested. Our securities lending activities and profitability may decrease.\nWe May Have to Pledge Collateral or Make Payments in Derivatives Transactions\nWe may have to pledge additional collateral and increase payments we make under our derivatives transactions. Regulators, clearinghouses, counterparties, or clearing brokers may restrict or eliminate eligible collateral, increase our collateral requirements, or charge us to pledge such collateral, which would increase our costs, reduce our investment income, and harm our liquidity.\nWe May Change Our Securities and Investments Valuation, or Take Allowances and Impairments on Our Investments, or Change Our Methodologies, Estimations, and Assumptions\nDuring periods of market disruption or rapidly changing market conditions, such as significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, or infrequent trading, or when market data is limited, our assets may become less liquid. We may base our asset valuations on less observable and more subjective judgments, assumptions, or methods that may result in estimated fair values that significantly vary by period, and may exceed the investment’s sale price. The estimated fair value of our securities may also decrease due to changes in valuation methods and assumptions.\nBusiness Risks\nOur Actual Claims or Other Results May Differ From Our Estimates, Assumptions, or Models\nIf our actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying underwriting, reserving, and other assumptions we used in establishing claim liabilities, we could be required to reduce value of business acquired (“VOBA”), increase our liabilities, or incur higher costs.\nThe amounts that we will ultimately pay to settle our liabilities, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future, may vary from what we expect. We may change our liability assumptions and increase our liabilities based on actual experience and accounting requirements. Our operating practices and procedures that support our policyholders and contractholder obligation assumptions, such as obtaining, accumulating, and filtering data, and our use of technology, such as database analysis and electronic communications, may affect our reserve estimates. If these practices and procedures do not accurately produce the data to support our assumptions or cause us to change our assumptions, or if enhanced technological tools become available to us, we may change those assumptions and procedures, as well as our reserves. If any of our operating practices and procedures do not accurately produce, or reproduce, data that we use to conduct any or all aspects of our business, such deviations or errors may negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition. We may change our assumptions, models, or reserves due to changes in longevity. Increases in the prevalence and accuracy of genetic testing, or restrictions on its use, may exacerbate adverse selection risks.\nPandemics and other public health issues have caused and may continue to cause increased claims under many of our policies (for example, life, disability, leave, long-term care, major medical and supplemental health products), raising our resulting costs. Governments or others may fail to produce accurate population and impact data that we use in our estimates, assumptions, models, or reserves, such as death rates, infections, morbidity, hospitalization, or illness. This may cause or exacerbate any of the risks related to our estimates or assumptions. Pandemics and other public health issues may cause related or consequential long-term economic, social, political, policy, regulatory, business, demographic, or other changes to our claims or other areas subject to estimates, assumptions, models, or reserves. We may not accurately predict, prepare, and adjust to these changes.\nWe May Face a Variety of Political, Legal, Operational, Economic and Other Risks Globally\nThe global nature of our business operations exposes us to a wide range of political, legal, operational, economic and other risks, including: nationalization or expropriation of assets; imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies; restrictions on the ability to access cash on deposit, changes in laws, their application or interpretation; political instability; military conflicts; economic or trade sanctions; sanctions on cross-border exchange listing, investment or other securities transactions; dividend limitations; price controls; regulations related to ESG matters; currency exchange controls or other transfer or exchange restrictions; difficulty enforcing contracts; regulatory restrictions; and public or political criticism of our business and operations. Some of these actions may affect us more harshly than our peers. Some of our businesses operate in emerging markets, where many of these risks are heightened.\nWe face other risks that may affect our global operations and investments, including those related to the imposition of tariffs or other barriers to international trade, changes to international trade agreements, uncertainties in intergovernmental organizations, pension system reforms, labor problems with workers’ associations or trade unions, and reliance on interconnected information systems and the security of such systems. \nExpanding our operations to new businesses or jurisdictions may require considerable management time and expenses before significant, if any, revenues and earnings are generated, which may reduce management and financial resources available for other uses. Our operations in new or existing markets may be unprofitable or achieve low margins.\nWe May Face Competition for Business\nCompetitive pressures, based on a number of factors including service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities, name recognition, performance against ESG metrics, technology, adaptation in light of pandemics and other public health issues, changes in regulation and taxes, and other factors, may adversely affect the persistency of our products and our ability to sell products in the future. We may be harmed by competition from other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services companies, which may have a broader array of products, more competitive pricing, higher claims paying ability ratings, greater financial resources with which to compete, or pre-existing customer bases for financial services products. Additionally, we may lose purchasers of group insurance products that are subject to periodic re-underwriting due to more favorable terms from competitors. Furthermore, the investment management and securities brokerage businesses have relatively low barriers to entry and continually attract new entrants. Our customers and clients may engage other financial service providers, resulting in our loss of business.\nAn increase in consolidation activity among banks, insurance brokers, broker-dealers and investment advisers may negatively impact the insurance industry’s sales. It may increase competition for access to distributors, resulting in greater distribution expenses, and may impair our ability to market insurance products to or expand our current customer base. Consolidation and other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will renegotiate agreements on terms less favorable to us.\nIn addition, legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment for our business may not impact all activities and companies equally, which could adversely affect our competitive position within the insurance industry and the broader financial services industry.\nWe Face Technological Changes That Present New and Intensified Challenges and May Fail to Foresee or Adapt to These Changes\nOur business operations rely on functioning and secure information systems and those of our vendors. Technological changes present us with new or intensified challenges, and if we are unable to foresee or adapt to these changes, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. For example, our assumptions, models and reserves may need to be modified if we are unable to accurately, timely, or completely process, store and retrieve the increased volume and variety of information relating to our businesses, including information related to deaths, that new technological tools for data collection and analysis make available.\nSimilarly, our distribution channels may become more automated to increase flexibility of access to our services and products. We may incur significant costs to implement and adapt to such changes. If we are unsuccessful, our results of operations, competitive position, reputation and customer and distribution relationships may be harmed. Steps taken to adapt to these changes, such as changes to the method of collection and analysis of data, could also expose us to litigation or other regulatory and legal actions.\nTechnological changes may affect our business model and how we interact with existing or prospective customers, and evolving consumer preferences may require a redesign of our products and investment composition. For example, changes in emerging technology and increasing consumer preferences for e-commerce may harm the profitability of some businesses. Likewise, the growth and availability of AI technologies, including generative AI, presents significant opportunities but also complex challenges; these include balancing and mitigating potential risks of harm posed by the development or deployment of AI technologies, as well as implementing and maintaining controls reasonably designed to ensure compliance with an evolving and increasingly complex AI regulatory landscape. We may fail to adjust our investments accordingly or suffer stranded assets. If we are unable to update our business model to match evolving consumer preferences and purchasing behavior, or the evolving technological landscape, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nNew technologies may impact the configuration of our information systems, and how they connect with those of our vendors, service providers and/or partners. Such technological developments may introduce or uncover information security vulnerabilities, which may result in breaches or increased costs associated with maintaining appropriate data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity measures or enforcement actions against us by regulators. Any such vulnerability that results in a security breach or failure of our information systems, or those of third parties on which we rely, may result in litigation, regulatory action, negative impacts to our business operations, and reputational harm.\nWe May Face Catastrophes That Affect Liabilities for Policyholder Claims and Reinsurance Availability\nCatastrophic events could increase claims, impair assets in or otherwise harm our investment portfolio, and could harm our reinsurers’ financial condition, increasing reinsurance defaults. Catastrophic events may also reduce economic activity in affected areas, which could harm our existing business or prospects for new business, or the value of our investments. The severity of claims from catastrophic events may be higher if property values increase due to inflation or other factors or our insured lives or property are geographically concentrated.\nPandemics and other public health issues or other events, and governmental, business, and consumer reactions to them, may affect economic conditions and may cause a large number of illnesses or deaths. Hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather, fires, floods and mudslides, blackouts and man-made events such as riot, insurrection, terrorist attacks or acts of war may also cause catastrophic losses and increased claims. Any such catastrophes may also result in changes in consumer or business confidence, behavior and investment and business activity, changes to interest rates and other market risk factors, and governmental or other restrictions on economic activity for prolonged periods. \nConsistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. The liabilities we have established may not be adequate to cover our actual claim liabilities. Our efforts to manage risks may be impeded by restrictions on our ability to withdraw from catastrophe-prone areas or on the availability of reinsurance in such markets. We may be unable to obtain catastrophe reinsurance at rates we find acceptable, or at all. We may also be called upon to make contributions to guaranty associations or similar organizations as a result of catastrophes.\nWe May Face Direct or Indirect Effects of Climate Change or Responses to It\nClimate change may increase the frequency and severity of short-, medium-, or long-term weather-related disasters, public health incidents, wildfires, rising sea levels and pandemics, and their effects may increase over time. Changes in policy, regulation, technology or market behaviors in response to climate change may harm the value of investments we hold or harm our counterparties, including reinsurers, or increase our compliance costs. Our regulators may also increasingly focus their examinations on our management of climate-related risks.\nWe May Need to Fund Deficiencies in Our Closed Block, and May Not Re-Allocate Closed Block Assets\nThe closed block assets established in connection with the MLIC demutualization, their cash flows, and the revenue from the closed block policies may not be sufficient to provide for the policies’ guaranteed benefits. If they are not, we must fund the shortfall. We may choose, for competitive or other reasons, to support policyholder dividend payments with our general account funds. Such actions may reduce funds otherwise available for other uses. The assets of the closed block can never revert to the benefit of MLIC’s non-closed block policyholders or us, as sole shareholder of MLIC.\nWe May Be Required to Recognize an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to Establish a Valuation Allowance Against Our Deferred Income Tax Assets\nWe may reduce our estimated fair value of business units, impairing our goodwill and charging net income, if prolonged market declines or other factors negatively impact the performance of our businesses.\nWe may write down long-lived assets if we conclude we will be unable to recover their carrying amount.\nWe may charge net income because we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not realize a deferred income tax asset based on the performance of the business and its ability to generate future taxable income. In addition, we may need to adjust the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities if tax rates change.\nWe May Be Required to Impair VOBA, VODA or VOCRA\nAdverse changes to investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest crediting rates, dividends paid to policyholders, expenses to administer the business, significant or sustained equity market declines, significant changes to bond spreads, and certain other economic variables, such as inflation, could cause an impairment of the value of distribution agreements acquired (“VODA”), VOBA or the value of customer relationships acquired (“VOCRA”). We may accelerate amortization or impair these assets in the period these occur.\nWe May Face Volatility, Higher Risk Management Costs, and Increased Counterparty Risk Due to Guarantees Within Certain of Our Products\nOur liabilities for guaranteed benefits, including no-lapse guarantee benefits, guaranteed minimum death benefits, guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits, guaranteed minimum income benefits, and certain minimum crediting rate features could increase if equity or fixed income funds decline or become more volatile, or interest rates decrease.\nOur derivatives and other risk management strategies to hedge our economic exposure to these liabilities may harm our results. Our use of reinsurance, derivatives, or other risk management techniques may not sufficiently offset the costs of guarantees or protect us against losses from changes in policyholder behavior, mortality, or market events.\nPolicyholders may also change their behavior in unexpected ways. For example, policyholders seeking liquidity due to economic uncertainty or challenges may withdraw or surrender their policies, change their premium payment practices, exercise product options, or take other actions at times and for amounts different from those we expect.\nOperational Risks\nOur Risk Management Policies and Procedures, or Our Models, May Leave Us Exposed to Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk\nOur ERM and business continuity policies and procedures may not be sufficiently comprehensive and may not identify or adequately protect us from every risk to which we are exposed.\nPandemics and other public health issues, and authorities’ and people’s reactions thereto may strain our risk management, and our business continuity plans, introduce or increase our operational and cybersecurity risks, and otherwise impair our ability to manage our business. They may increase the frequency and sophistication of attempts at unauthorized access to our technology systems, or those of third parties on which we rely. They may hinder our efforts to prevent money-laundering or other fraud, whether due to limited abilities to “know our customers,” strains on our programs to avoid and deter foreign corrupt practices, or otherwise, and may increase both our compliance costs and our risk of violations.\nThe assumptions, projections and data on which our risk management models are based may be inaccurate, and our models may not be suitable for their purpose, be misused, not operate properly, and contain errors. Our decisions and model adjustments, including determination of reserves, are based on such model output and reports and may be flawed. We may fail to identify or remediate model errors adequately. Our models may not fully predict future exposures or correctly reflect past experience.\nOur evaluation of markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. We may not effectively identify and monitor all risks or appropriately limit our exposures and our associates, vendors or non-employee sales agents may not follow our risk management policies and procedures. Past or future misconduct by our associates, vendors or non-employee sales agents could result in investigations, violations of law, regulatory sanctions, and litigation. We may have to implement more extensive or different risk management policies and procedures due to legal and regulatory requirements.\nOur Policies and Procedures May Be Insufficient to Protect Us From Operational Risks\nWe may make errors in any of the large number of transactions we process through our complex administrative systems. Our controls and procedures to prevent such errors may not be effective. Our controls and procedures to comply with and enforce contractual obligations may not always be effective. Mistakes can subject us to claims from our customers.\nIf we are unable to obtain necessary and accurate information from our customers or their employees, we may be unable to provide or verify coverage and pay claims, or we may pay claims without sufficient documentation.\nThe controls of our vendors on whom we rely may not meet our standards or be adequate. Our vendors could fail to perform their services accurately, consistently with applicable law or timely. Our exchange of information with vendors may be imperfect, or our vendors may suffer financial or reputational distress. Each of these may cause errors, misconduct, or discontinuation of services.\nWe may fail to escheat property timely and completely. As a result, we may incur charges, reserve strengthening, and expenses, regulatory examinations, or penalties.\nOur practices and procedures may, at times, limit our efforts to contact all our customers, which may result in delayed, untimely, or missed customer payments.\nOur associates, vendors, non-employee sales agents, customers, or others may commit fraud against us. Our policies and procedures may be ineffective in preventing, detecting or mitigating fraud and other illegal or improper acts.\nWe may fail to attract, motivate and retain employees, develop talent, and plan for management succession. Additionally, attrition could cause a lapse in implementation of policies and procedures.\nNotwithstanding our compliance with regulatory and accounting requirements in relation to internal controls and our conclusion that internal control over financial reporting is effective as of the date reported, the Company’s internal controls have in the past proved, and there is a risk that they may in the future prove, to be deficient or ineffective.\nWe May Fail to Protect the Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability of Our Systems or Data, Including As a Result of a Failure in Our Cybersecurity or Other Information Security Systems or Our Disaster Recovery Plans or Those of Our Vendors\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our information systems, and those of our service providers, vendors, and other third parties. Our business relies on the proper functioning of these systems, including processing claims, transactions and applications, providing information to customers and distributors, performing actuarial analyses, retaining customer and business records and other core business functions. A failure to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of such systems, use by our employees or agents of unauthorized tools, software or other technology to communicate with customers or business counterparties or a failure to maintain the security of our internal or external vendors’ systems, or the confidential information stored thereon, may adversely affect our ability to conduct business, result in regulatory enforcement action and litigation, and harm our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nWe, our employees, and our vendors, like other commercial entities, continue to be targeted by or subject to computer viruses or other malicious code, unauthorized or fraudulent access, human errors, ransomware or cyber-attacks, and other breaches or incidents affecting our cybersecurity and information security systems. Globally, the frequency, severity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents have increased, and these trends may continue. While we have implemented what we believe to be reasonable and appropriate cybersecurity and data protection measures across business lines and at the enterprise level (and we contractually require our critical vendors to implement similar measures), including a formal risk-based information security program, our efforts to minimize the risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent material break-ins, attacks, fraud, security breaches or other unauthorized access to our and our vendors’ systems, including as a result of software code that contains vulnerabilities, which may increase the potential of cyber attacks or unauthorized access. We may not detect such incidents in a timely manner. \nIf we or our vendors fail to prevent, detect, address and mitigate such incidents, we may suffer significant financial and reputational harm. There is no assurance that our security measures or those of our vendors, including information security policies, administrative, technical and physical controls and other actions designed as preventative, will provide fully effective protection from such events.\nIn addition, we routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means, including customers’ confidential health-related information. Although we attempt to keep such information confidential and secure, we may be unable to do so in all events, and we or our vendors may also fail to maintain adequate internal controls or comply with relevant policies and procedures designed to ensure the privacy and integrity of sensitive data. Such failure may result in our or our vendors’ intentional or unintentional disclosure or misuse of such personal, confidential or proprietary information, as well as others’ misappropriation of such information, which could damage our reputation, reduce demand for our products and services and subject us to significant legal and regulatory liability and expenses, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe, our vendors, our reinsurers, and our customers may suffer disasters such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack, ransomware or cyber-attack, or war, and our or their disaster recovery systems may be insufficient to safeguard our ability to conduct normal business operations, obtain reinsurance and maintain our critical business or information technology systems in such circumstances, particularly if such disasters affect computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and/or destroy or otherwise adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of valuable data or the financial wherewithal of reinsurers or vendors. Our ability to conduct business effectively and maintain the security, integrity, confidentiality, availability or privacy of sensitive data could be severely compromised if, as a result of such disaster, key personnel are unavailable, or our vendors’ ability to provide goods and services and our associates’ ability to perform their job responsibilities are impaired. We may not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to protect us from all losses that may result from such interruptions, and any insurance for liability, operational and other risks may become less readily available or more expensive in the future.\nWe may not be able to reliably access all the documents and records in the information storage systems we use, whether electronic or physical. We may fail to obtain or maintain all the records we need to administer and establish appropriate reserves for benefits and claims accurately and timely. If a data breach exposed any of our sensitive financial information, then customers, investors, or regulators may develop an inaccurate perception of our financial condition or results of operations. We could be compelled to publicly disclose information prematurely in order to dispel such inaccurate perceptions, or in order to fulfill our disclosure obligations, even if we do not believe the information is yet completely reliable or confirmed per our usual internal controls and disclosure controls. This may result in harm to our reputation.\nRegulators’ or others’ scrutiny of cybersecurity, including new laws or regulations, could increase our compliance costs and operational burdens, especially as regulatory and legislative focus on cybersecurity matters intensifies, which could lead to more enforcement actions of such laws or regulations. See “Business — Regulation — Cybersecurity, Privacy and Data Protection, and Innovation and Technology Regulation” for additional information. Regulators, customers, or others may act against us for any cybersecurity failures. We also have an increasing challenge of attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel to assist us in combating these security threats. Our continuous technological evaluations and enhancements, including changes designed to update our protective measures, may increase our risk of a breach or gap in our security. We may incur higher costs to comply with laws on, or regulators’ scrutiny of, our use, collection, management, or transfer of data and other privacy practices. We are continuously evaluating and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security systems and creating new systems and processes. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in preventing or limiting the impact of future cybersecurity incidents.\nWe May Face Changes in Accounting Standards\nAuthorities may change accounting standards that apply to us, and we may adopt changes earlier than required. Changes in accounting rules applicable to our business may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. For a discussion of the impact of U.S. GAAP accounting pronouncements issued but not yet implemented, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur Associates May Take Excessive Risks\nOur associates, including executives and others who manage sales, investments, products, wholesaling, underwriting, and others, may take excessive risks. Our compensation programs and practices, and our other controls, may not effectively deter excessive risk-taking or misconduct.\nWe May Have Difficulty in or Complications from Marketing and Distributing Our Products\nOur product distributors may suspend, alter, reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us if we change our strategy, if our business performance declines, as a result of rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks, or for regulatory or other reasons. Our distributors may merge, change their business models in ways that affect us, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, and new distribution channels could emerge, harming our distribution efforts. Distributors may try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to less favorable terms for us due to consolidation or other industry changes or for other reasons. Disruption or changes to our relationships with our distributors could harm our ability to market our products.\nOur employees or unaffiliated firms or agents may distribute our products in an inappropriate manner, or our customers may not understand them or whether they are suitable.\nWe May Change Our Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Assumptions\nWe may change our discount rate, rate of return on plan assets, mortality rate, compensation level or medical trends assumptions, harming our benefit plan estimates.\nWe May be Unable to Protect Our Intellectual Property and May Face Infringement Claims\nWe may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing on or misappropriating our intellectual property. We may incur litigation costs to enforce and protect it or to determine its scope or validity, and we may not be successful.\nIn addition, we may be subject to claims by third parties for infringement of intellectual property, breach of license usage rights, or misappropriation of trade secrets. We may incur significant expenses for any such claims. If we are found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party intellectual property right, we may be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from certain intellectual property. Alternatively, we could be required to execute costly licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly alternative.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions, Dispositions or Other Structural Changes\nWe May Face Difficulties, Unforeseen Liabilities, Asset Impairments or Rating Actions from Business Acquisitions or Integrating and Managing Growth of Such Businesses, Dispositions of Businesses, or Legal Entity Reorganizations\nAcquisitions and dispositions of businesses, joint ventures, and other structural changes expose us to a number of risks arising from, among other factors, economic, operational, strategic, financial, tax, legal, regulatory, and compliance. As a result, there can be no assurance that any acquisition, disposition or reorganization will be completed as contemplated, or at all. We may not realize the anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of any transaction. Effecting these transactions may result in unforeseen expenditures and liabilities or a performance different than we expected. The areas where we face risks include, among others, rights to indemnification for losses, regulatory, liquidity and capital requirements, loss of customers, distributors, vendors and key personnel, diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges or growth strategies from maximizing business value, and inability to realize anticipated efficiencies. Our success in conducting business through joint ventures will depend on our ability to manage a variety of issues, including: (i) our exposure to additional operational, financial, legal, tax or compliance risks as a result of entry into certain joint ventures; (ii) our dependence on a joint venture counterparty given limits on our ownership or distribution requirements, as well as for resources, including capital and product distribution, may reduce our control over, financial returns from, or the value of a joint venture; and (iii) our counterparties' cooperation or their ability to meet obligations, or election to alter, modify or terminate a relationship.\nReorganizing or consolidating the legal entities through which we conduct business may raise similar risks. Our success in realizing the benefits from legal entity reorganizations will also depend on our management of various issues, including regulatory approvals, modification of our operations and changes to our investment portfolios or derivatives hedging activities.\nAny of these risks, if realized, could prevent us from achieving the benefits we expect from such transactions.\nWe May Face Risks Related to Our Separation from Brighthouse\nWe may not realize any or all of the expected tax or other benefits of the Brighthouse separation. Brighthouse may not succeed as a standalone entity, causing litigation or regulatory claims against us.\nGovernance Risks\nMetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors May Influence the Outcome of Stockholder Votes on Matters Due to the MetLife Policyholder Trust\nOur Board of Directors may be able to influence stockholder votes by virtue of the MetLife Policyholder Trust and the number of shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock held in it. Trust beneficiary vote instructions are likely to have disproportionate weight on votes concerning certain fundamental corporate actions because the trustee will vote all the shares of common stock held by the trust in proportion to those instructions actually received.\nWe may incur regulatory, mailing, or other costs related to the termination of the trust, distribution of the common stock held in the trust to beneficiaries and the resulting increase in the number of shareholders with full voting rights. This increase may affect the outcome of matters brought to a stockholder vote and other aspects of our corporate governance.\nState or Federal Laws, or MetLife, Inc.’s Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, May Delay, Deter or Prevent Takeovers and Business Combinations\nState laws, federal laws and MetLife, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider favorable. These provisions may adversely affect the price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock if they discourage takeover attempts.\nStockholders’ changes to MetLife, Inc.’s corporate governance may make it more difficult for the Board of Directors to protect stockholders’ interests.",
