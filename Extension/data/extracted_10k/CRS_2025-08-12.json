      "text": "Item 1.  Business\n\n(a)             General Development of Business:\n\nCarpenter Technology Corporation, founded in 1889, is engaged in the manufacturing, fabrication and distribution of specialty metals. As used throughout this report, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms \"Carpenter,\" \"Carpenter Technology,\" \"Company,\" \"Registrant,\" \"Issuer,\" \"we\" and \"our\" refer to Carpenter Technology Corporation.\n\n(b)             Financial Information About Segments:\n\nWe are organized in two reportable business segments: Specialty Alloys Operations (\"SAO\") and Performance Engineered Products (\"PEP\"). See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional segment reporting information. \n\n(c)              Narrative Description of Business:\n (1)               General:\n\nWe are a producer and distributor of premium specialty alloys, including titanium alloys, powder metals, stainless steels, alloy steels, and tool steels. We are a recognized leader in high-performance specialty alloy-based materials and process solutions for critical applications in the aerospace, defense, medical, transportation, energy, industrial and consumer markets. We have evolved to become a pioneer in premium specialty alloys, including titanium, nickel, and cobalt, as well as alloys specifically engineered for additive manufacturing processes and soft magnetics applications.\nReportable Segments\n\nThe SAO segment is comprised of the Company's major premium alloy and stainless steel manufacturing operations. This includes operations performed at mills primarily in Reading and Latrobe, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas as well as South Carolina and Alabama. The combined assets of the SAO segment are managed in an integrated manner to optimize efficiency and profitability across the total system. \nThe PEP segment is comprised of the Company's differentiated operations. This segment includes the Dynamet titanium business, the Carpenter Additive business and the Latrobe and Mexico distribution businesses. The businesses in the PEP segment are managed with an entrepreneurial structure to promote flexibility and agility to quickly respond to market dynamics. \n(2)                 Raw Materials:\n\nOur business depends on continued receipt of critical raw materials for our day to day operations. These raw materials include nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, titanium, iron and scrap containing the named alloys. Some of the sources of these raw materials, many of which are international, could be subject to potential interruptions of supply as a result of political events, labor unrest or other reasons. These potential interruptions could cause material shortages and affect availability and price. We have arrangements with certain vendors to provide consigned materials at our manufacturing facilities available for our consumption as necessary. \n\nWe have long-term relationships with major suppliers who provide availability of material at competitive prices. Purchase prices of certain raw materials have historically been volatile, including the impact of tariffs. We use pricing surcharges, indexing mechanisms, base price adjustments and raw material forward contracts to reduce the impact on our business of changing prices for the most significant of these materials. There can be delays between the time of the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefits of such mechanisms or actions that could have a short-term impact on our results and could affect the comparability of our results from period to period. \n\n(3)                 Patents and Licenses:\n\nWe own a number of United States and international patents and have granted licenses under some of them. In addition, certain products that we produce are covered by patents held or owned by other companies from whom licenses have been obtained. The duration of a patent issued in the United States is between 14 and 20 years from the date of filing a patent application or issuance of the patent. The duration of a patent issued outside of the United States varies from country to country. Generally, patent licenses are structured to match the duration of the underlying patent. Although these patents and licenses are believed to be of value, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any single such item or related group of such items.\n(4)                Seasonality of Business:\n\nOur sales can be influenced by seasonal factors with the first six months of the fiscal year typically being lower, principally because of annual plant vacation and maintenance shutdowns by us, as well as by many of our customers. However, the timing of major changes in the general economy or the markets for certain products can alter this pattern.\n(5)                 Customers:\n\nOn a consolidated basis, we are not dependent upon a single customer, or very few customers, such that the loss of any one or more particular customers would have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated statement of operations. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of total net sales for the years ended June 30, 2025, June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the accounts receivable outstanding at June 30, 2025 or June 30, 2024. See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for additional information.\n(6)                Competition:\n\nWe are leaders in specialty materials for critical applications with over 135 years of metallurgical and manufacturing expertise. Our business is highly competitive. We manufacture and supply materials to a variety of end-use market sectors and compete with various companies depending on the end-use market, product or geography. A significant portion of the products we produce are highly engineered materials for demanding applications. There are less than ten companies producing one or more similar products that we consider our major competitors for our high-value products used in demanding applications. Many of our products are generally required to meet complex customer product specifications and often require the materials to be qualified prior to supplying the customer. Our experience, technical capabilities, product offerings and research and development efforts represent barriers to existing and potential competitors. \n\nFor other products, there are several dozen smaller producing companies and converting companies that are also competitors, as well as several hundred independent distributors of products similar to those distributed by us. Additionally, numerous foreign companies produce various specialty metal products similar to those produced by us. Furthermore, a number of different products may, in certain instances, be substituted for our finished products. \n(7)                Research, Product and Process Development:\n\nOur expenditures for Company-sponsored research and development were $26.1 million, $25.6 million and $24.4 million in fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We believe that our ability to be an innovator in special material development and manufacturing processes has been and will continue to be an important factor in the success of the Company. Our worldwide staff of expert metallurgists, research and development scientists, engineers and service professionals work closely with our customers to identify and provide innovative solutions to specific product requirements. \n(8)                Environmental Regulations:\n\nWe are subject to various stringent federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to pollution, protection of public health and the environment, natural resource damages and occupational safety and health. Management evaluates the liability for future environmental remediation costs on a quarterly basis. We accrue amounts for environmental remediation costs representing management's best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs relating to environmental remediation. For further information on environmental remediation, see the Contingencies section included in Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" \n\nOur costs of maintaining and operating environmental control equipment were $18.0 million, $17.4 million and $15.7 million for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The capital expenditures for environmental control equipment were $1.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We anticipate spending approximately $0.8 million on environmental capital projects over the next five fiscal years. This includes approximately $0.4 million in fiscal year 2026. Due to the possibility of future regulatory developments, the amount of future capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. \n(9)                Human Capital Resources:\n\nWe maintain a high-performance work environment that supports our vision to be the preferred solutions provider in specialty materials. We value our employees and help them build careers that are as resilient, innovative and valuable as our work for our customers. We are committed to increasing employee engagement by leveraging the diversity and drive of our people, maximizing their talents, empowering them and supporting their career aspirations. \nHealth and Safety: Safety is our number one Core Value. We believe that a Zero Injury workplace is achievable and relentlessly pursue measures to increase safety and accountability for our employees. We are proactive in our approach to safety, working to eliminate hazards before causing injury or harm. We invest in our employees by providing appropriate tools, resources and education necessary to achieve a Zero Injury workplace. \nTalent Acquisition: We are always looking for nimble, smart, growth-minded people – regardless of background – to help our organization continue to succeed. We strive to be an employer of choice in the communities that we operate. We have built an organizational culture that seeks to be transparent, supportive of work/life balance, welcoming of diverse viewpoints, treating all with dignity and respect and supporting each individuals' needs for professional growth and development. \nPerformance Management: Our formalized bi-annual performance review process accelerates employee growth and development at every stage of the process: (1) objectives and goal setting, (2) ongoing performance check-ins and coaching, as well as (3) performance evaluation and review. We also have Structured Individual Development Plans to assist managers in effectively setting targeted development activities for their direct reports and aligning those activities with business priorities. \nEngagement: We regularly conduct a company-wide Employee Engagement Survey to collect tangible data to make our Company even better. The survey is conducted across the organization to seek input from all employees. The survey questions are updated regularly and cover a wide variety of topics, including safety, culture, diversity, inclusion and belonging, work/life balance and leadership and career development. Using the feedback provided by the Employee Engagement Survey, specific action plans are developed to address areas of concern or opportunities for improvement across the organization.\nProfessional Development: Our employees enjoy a wide variety of rewards that assist with engagement and development. From traditional items such as compensation to less traditional aspects such as work-life balance, hybrid and remote work arrangements, future career opportunities, and innovative work.\nDiversity and Inclusion: We have a culture that blends our different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from all employees. We seek to ensure that all our employees feel welcomed. Our values underlie our goal to ensure all employees are treated equally with dignity and respect regardless of their race, age, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Committee plays a critical role in advancing us to the next level of awareness and engagement. \nGovernance: Our policy is to comply with the letter and spirit of all laws that govern our operations and to adhere to the highest standards of business ethics. Our \"Code of Conduct\" includes general legal and ethical guidelines. The guidelines apply to all employees and majority-owned affiliates, including subsidiaries, both in the United States and other countries. \nAs of June 30, 2025, our total workforce consisted of approximately 4,500 employees. This included 179 production employees in Washington, Pennsylvania, who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement which expires on August 31, 2025. Negotiations with union representatives are currently in process. This also included 461 production employees in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement which expires on July 31, 2027. We believe our relations with our employees are generally good.\n\n(d)               Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales:\n\nSales outside of the United States, including export sales, were $1,177.2 million, $1,136.7 million and $994.1 million in fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Long-lived assets held outside of the United States were $5.0 million and $5.2 million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. For further information on domestic and international sales, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n\n(e)                Available Information:\n\nOur Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Carpenter Technology Corporation, which is also applicable to our other executive officers. There were no waivers of the Code of Ethics in fiscal year 2025.

      "text": "Item 1A.  Risk Factors\n\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with all businesses that could adversely affect operating performances or financial conditions. The following discussion outlines the risks and uncertainties that management believes are the most material to our business. However, these are not the only risks or uncertainties that could affect our business. Certain risks are associated specifically with our business, industry or customer base, while others have a broader effect. \n\nThe demand for certain products we produce may be cyclical.\n\nDemand in our end-use markets can be cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions, competitive influences and fluctuations in inventory levels throughout the supply chain. As such, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and availability of credit could fluctuate significantly from period to period. \n\nA significant portion of our sales represents products sold to customers in the commercial aerospace, defense and energy markets. The cyclicality of those markets can adversely affect our current business and our expansion objectives.\n\nThe commercial aerospace and defense markets are historically cyclical due to both external and internal market factors. These factors include general economic conditions, airline profitability, consumer demand for air travel, varying fuel and labor costs, price competition and international and domestic political conditions such as military conflict and the threat of terrorism. The length and degree of cyclical fluctuation can be influenced by any one or combination of these factors and therefore are difficult to predict with certainty. A downturn in the commercial aerospace or defense industry would adversely affect the demand for our products and/or the prices at which we are able to sell our products; our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe energy market has also been historically cyclical, principally as a result of volatile oil prices that impact demand for our products. Our future success requires us to, among other things, expand in key international energy markets by successfully adding to our customer base, distribution channels and product portfolio. The volatility of oil prices and other factors that contribute to the cyclicality of the energy market will impact our ability to expand successfully in this area and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \nAny significant delay or inability to successfully expand our operations in a timely and cost-effective manner could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n\nOver the last few years, we have undertaken capital projects associated with expanding our production capacity and capability. These projects place a significant demand on management and operational resources. Our success in expanding our operations in a cost-effective manner depends upon numerous factors including the ability of management to ensure the necessary resources are in place to properly execute these projects, our ability to obtain the necessary internal and customer qualifications to produce material from the facilities and our ability to operate the facilities to maximize the potential opportunities with minimal impacts to our existing operations. If we are not able to achieve the anticipated results from our capital expansion projects, or if we incur unanticipated delays, or excess costs, our results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected. \n\nPeriods of reduced demand and excess supply as well as the availability of substitute lower cost materials can adversely affect our ability to price and sell our products at the profitability levels we require to be successful.\n\nAdditional worldwide capacity and reduced demand for our products could significantly impact future worldwide pricing which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, continued availability of lower cost, substitute materials may cause significant fluctuations in future results as our customers opt for a lower cost alternative. \n\nWe change prices on our products as we deem necessary. In addition to the above general competitive impact, other market conditions and various economic factors beyond our control can adversely affect the timing of our pricing actions. The effects of any pricing actions may be delayed due to long manufacturing lead times or the terms of existing contracts. There is no guarantee that the pricing actions we implement will be effective in maintaining the Company's profit margin levels. \n\nWe rely on third parties to supply certain raw materials and supplies that are critical to the manufacture of our products and we may not be able to access alternative sources of these raw materials if the suppliers are unwilling or unable to meet our demand.\n\nCosts of certain critical raw materials, such as nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, titanium, iron and scrap containing these alloys have been volatile due to factors beyond our control. We expect to mitigate most of the adverse impact of rising raw material costs through raw material surcharges, indices to customers and raw material forward contracts, but changes in business conditions could adversely affect our ability to recover rapid increases in raw material costs and may adversely affect our results of operations. \n\nIn addition, the availability of critical raw materials and supplies is subject to factors that are not in our control. In some cases, these critical raw materials and supplies are purchased from suppliers operating in countries that may be subject to unstable political and economic conditions. At any given time, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical raw materials and supplies on a timely basis, at prices and other terms acceptable to us, or at all. \n\nIf suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials or are unwilling or unable to meet our demand, we may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, to the extent that we have quoted prices to customers and accepted customer orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, or have existing contracts, we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials to our customers.\nThe manufacture of some of our products is a complex process and requires long lead times. As a result, we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials. If unable to obtain adequate and timely receipts of required raw materials, we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation. \nWe provide benefits to active and retired employees throughout most of our Company, most of which are not covered by insurance; and thus, our financial condition can be adversely affected if our investment returns are insufficient to meet these obligations. \n\nWe have obligations to provide substantial benefits to active and retired employees, and most of the associated costs are paid by the Company and are not covered by insurance. In addition, certain employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans, with the majority of our plans covering employees in the United States. Benefits accrued to eligible participants of our largest qualified defined benefit pension plan and certain non-qualified pension plans were frozen effective December 31, 2016. Many domestic and international competitors do not provide defined benefit plans and/or retiree health care plans, and other international competitors operate in jurisdictions with government sponsored health care plans that may offer them a cost advantage. A decline in the value of plan investments in the future, an increase in costs or liabilities or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding. A requirement to accelerate or increase pension contributions in the future could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nThe extensive environmental, health and safety regulatory regimes applicable to our manufacturing operations create potential exposure to significant liabilities.\n\nThe nature of our manufacturing business subjects our operations to numerous and varied federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to pollution, protection of public health and the environment, natural resource damages and occupational safety and health. We have used, and currently use and manufacture, substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous, extremely hazardous or toxic under worker safety and health laws and regulations. Although we implement controls and procedures designed to reduce continuing risk of adverse impacts and health and safety issues, we could incur substantial cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations, non-compliance or liabilities under these regulatory regimes required at our facilities. \nWe have environmental remediation liabilities at some of our owned operating facilities and have been designated as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") with respect to certain third party Superfund or similar waste disposal sites and other third party owned sites. Additionally, we have been notified that we may be a PRP with respect to other Superfund sites as to which no proceedings have been instituted against us. From time to time, we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings involving alleged violations of, or liabilities arising from, environmental laws. \n\nWhen our liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate our costs, we record environmental liabilities in our financial statements. However, in many cases, we are not able to determine whether we are liable, or if liability is probable, in order to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss which could result from such environmental liabilities. Estimates of our liability remain subject to additional uncertainties, including the nature and extent of site contamination, available remediation alternatives, the extent of corrective actions that may be required, and the number and financial condition of other PRPs, as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation. We adjust our accruals to reflect new information as appropriate. Future adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period, but we cannot reliably predict the amounts of such future adjustments. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. \n\nOur manufacturing processes, and the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers, are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other \"Greenhouse Gases,\" and pending legislation or regulation of Greenhouse Gases, if enacted or adopted in an onerous form, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \n\nPolitical and scientific debates related to the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the global climate are prevalent. Regulation or some form of legislation aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas emissions is currently being considered both in the United States and globally. As a specialty alloy manufacturer, we will be affected, both directly and indirectly, if climate change legislation, such as use of a \"cap and trade\" system, is enacted and implemented. Such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nProduct liability and product quality claims could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nWe produce ultra high strength, high temperature and corrosion-resistant alloys designed for our customers' demanding applications particularly in our Aerospace and Defense, Medical and Energy end-use markets. Failure of the materials that are included in our customers' applications could give rise to substantial product liability claims. There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. We have a complex manufacturing process necessary to meet our customers' stringent product specifications. We are also required to adhere to various third party quality certifications and perform sufficient internal quality reviews to ensure compliance with established standards. If we fail to meet the customer specifications for their products, we may be subject to product quality costs and claims. These costs are generally not insured. The impacts of product liability and quality claims could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business subjects us to risks of litigation claims, as a routine matter, and this risk increases the potential for a loss that might not be covered by insurance.\n\nLitigation claims relate to the conduct of our currently and formerly owned businesses, including claims pertaining to product liability, commercial disputes, employment actions, employee benefits, compliance with domestic and international laws and regulations, personal injury, patent infringement and tax issues. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or that additional claims will not be made against us in the future. The outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to us. The resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for that period. We can give no assurance that any other matters brought in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nA portion of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements and union attempts to organize our other employees may cause work interruptions or stoppages.\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, there were 179 production employees at our Dynamet business unit located in Washington, Pennsylvania are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expires on August 31, 2025. Negotiations with union representatives are currently in process. As of June 30, 2025, there were 461 production employees at our Latrobe business unit located in Latrobe, Pennsylvania are covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expires on July 31, 2027. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the unions to replace those that expire which could result in work interruptions and stoppages. From time to time, the employees at our manufacturing facility in Reading, Pennsylvania, participate in election campaigns or union organizing attempts. There is no guarantee that future organization attempts will not result in union representation.\n\nOur manufacturing processes are complex and depend upon critical, high cost equipment for which there may be only limited or no production alternatives. \n\nIt is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unplanned equipment failures, and we could incur significant repair or replacement costs in the event of those failures. It is also possible that operations could be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages, explosions, fires, floods, accidents and severe weather conditions. We must make regular, substantial capital investments and changes to our manufacturing processes to lower production costs, improve productivity, manufacture new or improved products and remain competitive. We may not be in a position to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures if we fail to update, replace or make additions to our equipment or our manufacturing processes in a timely manner. The cost to repair or replace much of our equipment or facilities would be significant. We cannot be certain that we will have sufficient internally generated cash or acceptable external financing to make necessary capital expenditures in the future.\n\nA significant portion of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in Reading and Latrobe, Pennsylvania and Athens, Alabama, which increases our exposure to significant disruption to our business as a result of unforeseeable developments in these geographic areas.\n\nIt is possible that we could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen catastrophic events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in Reading and Latrobe, Pennsylvania and Athens, Alabama. As a result, we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations, accept materials from suppliers, meet customer shipment needs or address other severe consequences that may be encountered. Our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to supply energy consumed at each of our energy-intensive production facilities.\n\nThe prices for and availability of electricity, natural gas, oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions. These market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control. Disruptions or lack of availability in the supply of energy resources could temporarily impair the ability to operate our production facilities. Further, increases in energy costs, or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors, have affected and may continue to adversely affect our profitability. To the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive, increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nWe consider acquisitions, joint ventures and other business combination opportunities, as well as possible business unit dispositions, as part of our overall business strategy, that involve uncertainties and potential risks that we cannot predict or anticipate fully.\n\nFrom time to time, management holds discussions with management of other companies to explore such aforementioned opportunities. As a result, the relative makeup of the businesses comprising our Company is subject to change. Acquisitions, joint ventures and other business combinations involve various inherent risks. Such risks include difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies, diversion of management's attention from existing operations, difficulties in entering markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience, dependence on unfamiliar supply chains, insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions, loss of key employees of the acquired companies, inaccurate assessment of undisclosed liabilities, difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings, and increases in our debt or limitation on our ability to access additional capital when needed.\n\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe SEC has promulgated final rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These rules require due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the \"DRC\") or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the DRC. The Company timely filed its latest annual conflict minerals report required by the rules on May 19, 2025. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements going forward, including costs to determine the origin of conflict minerals used in our products. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. Also, we may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges if the due diligence procedures we continue to implement do not enable us to verify the origins for all conflict minerals or to determine that such minerals are DRC conflict-free.\nOur business may be impacted by external factors that we may not be able to control.\nWar (such as the current war in Ukraine, the war between Israel and HAMAS, the war between Israel and Hezbollah and the Houthi attacks on commercial shipping vessels and other naval vessels), civil conflict, terrorism, other geopolitical and diplomatic tensions, natural disasters, climate change and public health issues including domestic or international pandemics, other outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments have caused or could cause damage or disruption to domestic or international commerce by creating economic or political uncertainties. Additionally, the volatility in the financial markets could negatively impact our business. These events could result in a decrease in demand for our products, affect the availability of credit facilities to us, our customers or other members of the supply chain necessary to transact business, make it difficult or impossible to deliver orders to customers or receive materials from suppliers, affect the availability or pricing of energy sources or result in other severe consequences that may or may not be predictable. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. \n\nOur international operations and global sales expose us to various risks including the impact of tariffs, which may adversely affect our business.\n\nRisks associated with international operations include without limitation: political and economic instability, including weak conditions in the world's economies; difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; unstable or unenforced export controls; changes in legal and regulatory requirements; policy changes affecting the markets for our products; changes in duties, quotas, tariffs and taxes; changes in taxation including the ability to repatriate earnings; and exchange rate fluctuations (which may affect sales to international customers and the value of profits earned on international sales when converted into U.S. dollars). In addition, we will need to invest in building our capabilities and infrastructure to meet our international growth goals. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our results for the period in which they occur.\nSignificant changes to United States and international trade policies continue to emerge and activity levels have increased with regard to new import and export tariffs, retaliatory tariffs, and quotas; modifications to international trade policy; the withdrawal from or renegotiation of certain trade agreements; and other changes. These changes, including any implementation of or changes in trade sanctions, tariffs and embargoes, could materially adversely impact our business or require us to make changes to our current business practices or supply chain. \nWe value most of our inventory using the LIFO method, which could be repealed resulting in adverse effects on our cash flows and financial condition.\n\nThe cost of our inventories is primarily determined using the Last-In, First-Out (\"LIFO\") method. Under the LIFO inventory valuation method, changes in the cost of raw materials and production activities are recognized in cost of sales in the current period even though these materials and other costs may have been incurred at significantly different values due to the length of time of our production cycle. Generally, in a period of rising prices, LIFO recognizes higher costs of goods sold, which both reduces current income and assigns a lower value to the year-end inventory. From time to time, there have been proposals aimed at repealing the election to use the LIFO method for income tax purposes. According to these proposals, generally taxpayers that currently use the LIFO method would be required to revalue their LIFO inventory to its First-In, First-Out (\"FIFO\") value. As of June 30, 2025, if the FIFO method of inventory had been used instead of the LIFO method, our inventories would have been approximately $344.5 million higher. This increase in inventory would result in a one-time increase in taxable income which may be taken into account over the following several taxable years. The repeal of the LIFO method could result in a substantial tax liability which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe depend on the ability to hire and retain a qualified workforce and key personnel.\n\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including members of our executive management team, management, metallurgists and production positions. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified employee talent, or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success.\nCybersecurity attacks and other security breaches or failures in functionality of our information technology (\"IT\") and computer systems could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and compromise the integrity of confidential data. \n\nManagement relies extensively on IT infrastructure, including hardware, networks, software, people and processes, to provide useful information to conduct our business and support assessments and conclusions about operating performance. Our inability to produce relevant and/or reliable measures of operating performance in an efficient, cost-effective and well-controlled fashion may have significant negative impacts on our future operations. In addition, any material failure, interruption of service, or compromised data security could adversely affect our operations. Security breaches in our IT could result in theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property which could adversely impact our future results.\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our IT networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving in both frequency and sophistication and could be made by both internal and external individuals or groups with an extensive range of motives. If we are unable to prevent cybersecurity attacks and other information security breaches, we may encounter significant disruptions in our operations which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations or result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Such breaches may also harm our reputation, result in financial losses or subject us to litigation or other costs or penalties.\nThe carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill and other long-lived assets including property, plant, equipment and software and other intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. We review these assets at least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in performance, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations and a variety of other factors. Any future impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements may be impacted if we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. \nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley\"). Sarbanes-Oxley requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are also required to make a formal assessment and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm. In order to maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, resources, including accounting-related costs and management oversight.",
