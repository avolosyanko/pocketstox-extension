These authorizations include charters, franchises, permits, and certificates of public convenience issued by local and state governments and state utility commissions. ComEd's, BGE's (gas), Pepco DC's, and ACE's rights are generally non-exclusive while PECO's, BGE's (electric), Pepco MD's, and DPL's rights are generally exclusive. Certain authorizations are perpetual while others have varying expiration dates. The Utility Registrants anticipate working with the appropriate governmental bodies to extend or replace the authorizations prior to their expirations. The current ComEd Franchise Agreement with the City of Chicago (the City) has been in force since 1992. The Franchise Agreement became terminable on one year notice as of December 31, 2020. It now continues in effect indefinitely unless and until either party issues a notice of termination, effective one year later, or it is replaced by mutual agreement with a new franchise agreement between ComEd and the City. If either party terminates and no new agreement is reached between the parties, the parties could continue with ComEd providing electric services within the City with no franchise agreement in place. The City also has an option to terminate and purchase the ComEd system (“municipalize”), which also requires one year notice. Neither party has issued a notice of termination at this time, the City has not exercised its municipalization option, and no new agreement has become effective. ComEd is in the process of pursuing a new agreement with the City.\nWhile Exelon and ComEd cannot predict the ultimate outcome, fundamental changes in the agreement or other adverse actions affecting ComEd’s business in the City would require changes in their business planning models and operations and could have a material adverse impact on Exelon’s and ComEd’s consolidated financial statements. If the City were to disconnect from the ComEd system, ComEd would seek full compensation for the business and its associated property taken by the City, as well as for all damages resulting to ComEd and its system. ComEd would also seek appropriate compensation for stranded costs with FERC.\nUtility Regulations\nState utility commissions regulate the Utility Registrants' electric and gas distribution rates and service, issuances of certain securities, and certain other aspects of the business. The following table outlines the state commissions responsible for utility oversight:\n\nRegistrant        Commission     \nComEd             ICC            \nPECO              PAPUC          \nBGE               MDPSC          \nPepco             DCPSC/MDPSC    \nDPL               DEPSC/MDPSC    \nACE               NJBPU          \nThe Utility Registrants are public utilities under the Federal Power Act subject to regulation by FERC related to transmission rates and certain other aspects of the utilities' business. The U.S. Department of Transportation also regulates pipeline safety and other areas of gas operations for PECO, BGE, and DPL. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration) provided new security directives in 2021 that regulate cyber risks for certain gas distribution operators. Additionally, the Utility Registrants are subject to NERC mandatory reliability standards, which protect the nation's bulk power system against potential disruptions from cyber and physical security breaches.\nSeasonality Impacts on Delivery Volumes\nThe Utility Registrants' electric distribution volumes are generally higher during the summer and winter months when temperature extremes create demand for either summer cooling or winter heating. For PECO, BGE, and DPL, natural gas distribution volumes are generally higher during the winter months when cold temperatures create demand for winter heating. \nComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE have electric distribution decoupling mechanisms and BGE has a natural gas decoupling mechanism that eliminate the favorable and unfavorable impacts of weather and customer usage patterns on electric distribution and natural gas delivery volumes. As a result, ComEd's, BGE's, Pepco's, DPL Maryland's, and ACE's electric distribution revenues and BGE's natural gas distribution revenues are not intended to be impacted by delivery volumes. PECO's and DPL Delaware's electric distribution revenues and natural gas distribution revenues are impacted by delivery volumes.\nElectric and Natural Gas Distribution Services\nThe Utility Registrants are allowed to recover reasonable costs and fair and prudent capital expenditures associated with electric and natural gas distribution services and earn a return on those capital expenditures, subject to commission approval. Beginning in 2024 through 2027, ComEd's electric distribution costs are recovered through a multi-year rate plan with case proceedings as filed with the ICC. PECO's and DPL's electric and gas distribution costs and ACE’s electric distribution costs have generally been recovered through base rate case proceedings, with PECO utilizing a fully projected future test year, DPL Delaware's electric and gas distribution services utilizing either a partial actual and partial forecast test year or a fully historical test year, and ACE utilizing a fully historical test year. BGE’s electric and gas distribution costs and Pepco’s and DPL Maryland's electric distribution costs are currently recovered through multi-year rate case proceedings, as the MDPSC and the DCPSC allow utilities to file multi-year rate plans. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants use specific recovery mechanisms as approved by their respective regulatory agencies. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \nComEd, Pepco, DPL and ACE customers have the choice to purchase electricity, and PECO and BGE customers have the choice to purchase electricity and natural gas from competitive electric generation and natural gas suppliers. DPL customers, with the exception of certain commercial and industrial customers, do not have the choice to purchase natural gas from competitive natural gas suppliers. The Utility Registrants remain the distribution service providers for all customers and are obligated to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in their respective service territories while charging a regulated rate for distribution service. In addition, the Utility Registrants also retain significant default service obligations to provide electricity to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive electric generation supplier. PECO, BGE, and DPL also retain significant default service obligations to provide natural gas to certain groups of customers in their respective service areas who do not choose a competitive natural gas supplier. \nFor customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from competitive suppliers, the Utility Registrants act as the billing agent and therefore do not record Operating revenues or Purchased power and fuel expense related to the electricity and/or natural gas. For customers that choose to purchase electric generation or natural gas from a Utility Registrant, the Utility Registrants are permitted to recover the electricity and natural gas procurement costs from customers without mark-up or with a slight mark-up and therefore record the amounts in Operating revenues and Purchased power and fuel expense. As a result, fluctuations in electricity or natural gas sales and procurement costs have no significant impact on the Utility Registrants’ Net income.\nSee ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Results of Operations and Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding electric and natural gas distribution services. \nProcurement of Electricity and Natural Gas\nExelon does not generate the electricity it delivers. The Utility Registrants' electric supply for its customers is primarily procured through contracts as directed by their respective state laws and regulatory commission actions. The Utility Registrants procure electricity supply from various approved bidders or from purchases on the PJM operated markets.\nPECO's, BGE’s, and DPL's natural gas supplies are purchased from a number of suppliers for terms that currently do not exceed three years. PECO, BGE, and DPL each have annual firm transportation contracts of 437,000 mmcf, 283,000 mmcf, and 44,000 mmcf, respectively, for delivery of gas. To supplement gas transportation and supply at times of heavy winter demands and in the event of temporary emergencies, PECO, BGE, and DPL have available storage capacity from the following sources:\n\n                                                                                                  Peak Natural Gas Sources (in mmcf)\n                  LNG Facility                      Propane-Air Plant                      Underground Storage Service Agreements(a)\nPECO              1,200                                   150                                                 19,400                \nBGE               1,056                                   550                                                 22,000                \nDPL                 250                                           N/A                                          3,900                \n___________\n(a)Natural gas from underground storage represents approximately 27%, 40%, and 33% of PECO's, BGE’s, and DPL's 2024-2025 heating season pipeline capacity, respectively.\nPECO, BGE, and DPL have long-term interstate pipeline contracts and also participate in the interstate markets by releasing pipeline capacity or bundling pipeline capacity with gas for off-system sales. Off-system gas sales are low-margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural gas. Earnings from these activities are shared between the utilities and customers. PECO, BGE, and DPL make these sales as part of a program to balance its supply and cost of natural gas. The off-system gas sales are not material to PECO, BGE, and DPL.\nSee ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK, Commodity Price Risk (All Registrants), for additional information regarding Utility Registrants' contracts to procure electric supply and natural gas.\nEnergy Efficiency Programs\nThe Utility Registrants are generally allowed to recover costs associated with energy efficiency and demand response programs they offer. Each commission approved program seeks to meet mandated electric consumption reduction targets and implement demand response measures to reduce peak demand. The programs are designed to meet standards required by each respective regulatory agency.\nComEd, with limited exceptions, earns a return on its energy efficiency costs through a regulatory asset. ACE earns a return on most of its energy efficiency and demand response program costs through a regulatory asset. Historically, BGE, Pepco Maryland, and DPL Maryland deferred most of their energy efficiency program costs to a regulatory asset and either deferred most of their demand response program costs to a regulatory asset or capitalized them. In 2024, BGE, Pepco, and DPL began deferring less energy efficiency and demand response program costs to a regulatory asset. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCapital Investment\nThe Utility Registrants' businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments, primarily in electric transmission and distribution and natural gas transportation and distribution facilities, to ensure the adequate capacity, reliability, and efficiency of their systems. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, Liquidity and Capital Resources, for additional information regarding projected 2025 capital expenditures.\nTransmission Services\nThe Utility Registrants, as owners of transmission facilities, are required to provide open access to their transmission facilities at cost-based rates pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC. The Utility Registrants and their affiliates are required to comply with FERC’s Standards of Conduct regulation governing the communication of non-public transmission information between the transmission owner’s employees and wholesale merchant employees.\nPJM is the regional grid operator and operates pursuant to its FERC-approved tariffs. PJM is the transmission provider under, and the administrator of, the PJM Tariff. PJM operates the PJM energy, capacity, and other wholesale markets. PJM controls the day-to-day operations of the bulk power system for the region. The Utility Registrants are members of PJM and provide regional transmission service pursuant to the PJM Tariff. The Utility Registrants and the other transmission owners in PJM have turned over control of certain of their transmission facilities to PJM, and their transmission systems are under the dispatch control of PJM. Under the PJM Tariff, transmission service is provided on a region-wide, open-access basis through the transmission facilities of the PJM transmission owners.\nThe Utility Registrants' transmission rates are based on a FERC approved formula. The rates are updated on an annual basis.\nExelon’s Strategy and Outlook\nExelon is a transmission and distribution company that delivers electricity and natural gas service to our customers and communities. Exelon's businesses remain focused on maintaining industry leading operational excellence, meeting or exceeding their financial commitments, ensuring timely recovery on investments to enable customer benefits, supporting clean energy policies including those that advance our jurisdictions' clean energy targets, and continued commitment to corporate responsibility. \nExelon’s strategy is to improve reliability and operations, enhance the customer experience, and advance clean and affordable energy choices, while ensuring ratemaking mechanisms provide the utilities fair financial returns. The jurisdictions in which Exelon has operations have set some of the nation's leading clean energy targets and our strategy is to enable that future for all our stakeholders. The Utility Registrants invest in rate base that supports service to our customers and the community, including investments that sustain and improve reliability and resiliency and that enhance the service experience of our customers. The Utility Registrants make these investments prudently at a reasonable cost to customers. Exelon seeks to leverage its scale and expertise across the utilities platform through enhanced standardization and sharing of resources and best practices to achieve improved operational and financial results. \nManagement continually evaluates growth opportunities aligned with Exelon’s businesses, assets, and markets, leveraging Exelon’s expertise in those areas and offering sustainable returns.\nThe Utility Registrants anticipate investing approximately $38 billion over the next four years in electric and natural gas infrastructure improvements and modernization projects, including smart grid technology, storm hardening, advanced reliability technologies, new business, and transmission projects, which is projected to result in an increase to current rate base of approximately $20 billion by the end of 2028. These investments provide greater reliability, improved service for our customers, increased capacity to accommodate new technologies and support a cleaner grid, and a stable return for the company.\nIn August 2021, Exelon announced its Path to Clean goal to collectively reduce its operations-driven GHG emissions 50% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline and to reach net-zero operations-driven GHG emissions by 2050, while supporting customers and communities in achieving their GHG reduction goals (Path to Clean). Exelon's quantitative goals include its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, with the exception of Scope 2 emissions associated with system losses of electric power delivered to customers (\"line losses\"), and build upon Exelon's long-standing commitment to reducing our GHG emissions. Exelon's Path to Clean efforts extend beyond these quantitative goals to include efforts such as customer energy efficiency programs, which support reductions in customers' direct emissions and have the potential to reduce Exelon's Scope 3 emissions and Scope 2 line losses as well. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS — Environmental Matters and Regulation — Climate Change for additional information.\nVarious regulatory, legislative, operational, market, and financial factors could affect Exelon's success in pursuing its strategies. Exelon continues to assess infrastructure, operational, policy, and legal solutions to these issues. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information.\nEmployees\nThe Registrants strive to create a diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace so that they can innovate, grow, and meet the needs of their employees, customers, and community. Therefore, the Registrants take steps to attract, develop, and retain highly qualified talent with a broad range of skills, expertise, and backgrounds who reflect the communities they serve. The Registrants strive to foster an environment where all employees are engaged, feel a sense of belonging and can pursue their full potential – providing comprehensive employee development opportunities to build the skills of their workforce and create high performing teams. Employee well-being and safety are a priority. The Registrants provide a full suite of wellness benefits targeted at supporting work-life balance, physical, mental, and financial health, and industry-leading paid leave policies.\nThe Registrants typically conduct an employee engagement survey every other year to gain feedback from employees, help identify organizational strengths, and help identify areas of opportunity for growth. The survey results are reviewed with senior management and the Exelon Board of Directors.\nDiversity Metrics\nThe following tables show diversity metrics for all employees and management as of December 31, 2024.

Exelon has a management team to address environmental compliance and strategy, including the President and Chief Executive Officer; the Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer; as well as senior management of the Utility Registrants. Performance of those individuals directly involved in environmental compliance and strategy is reviewed and affects compensation as part of the annual individual performance review process. The Audit and Risk Committee oversees compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including environmental risks related to Exelon's operations and facilities, as well as SEC disclosures related to environmental matters. Exelon's Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to oversee Exelon’s climate change and sustainability policies and programs, as discussed in further detail below. The respective Boards of the Utility Registrants oversee environmental issues related to these companies. The Exelon Board of Directors has general oversight responsibilities for Environmental, Social, and Governance matters, including strategies and efforts to protect and improve the quality of the environment.\nClimate Change\nAs detailed below, the Registrants face climate change mitigation and transition risks as well as adaptation risks. Mitigation and transition risks include changes to the energy systems as a result of new technologies, changing customer expectations and/or voluntary GHG goals, as well as local, state or federal regulatory requirements intended to reduce GHG emissions. Adaptation risk refers to risks to the Registrants' facilities or operations that may result from changes to the physical climate and environment, such as changes to temperature, weather patterns and sea level. \nClimate Change Mitigation and Transition\nThe Registrants support comprehensive federal climate legislation that addresses the urgent need to substantially reduce national GHG emissions while providing appropriate protections for consumers, businesses, and the economy. In the absence of comprehensive federal climate legislation, Exelon supports the EPA moving forward with meaningful regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. \nThe Registrants currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, federal and/or state law and/or regulations addressing GHG emissions. The direct (Scope 1) GHG emission sources associated with the Registrants include sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) leakage from electric transmission and distribution operations, fossil fuel combustion in motor vehicles and refrigerant leakage from chilling and cooling equipment. In addition, PECO, BGE, and DPL, as distributors of natural gas, have natural gas (methane) leakage on the natural gas systems. The Registrants also have indirect (Scope 2 and 3) emissions associated with the production of the electricity they consume and deliver, and indirect (Scope 3) emissions associated with the production of natural gas they deliver and consumer use of such natural gas.\nExelon uses definitions and protocols provided by the World Resources Institute for its GHG inventory. In 2023, Exelon's Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions were just over 5.3 million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent using the World Resources Institute Corporate Standard Market-based accounting. Of these emissions, 0.4 million metric tons are considered to be operations-driven and in more direct control of our employees and processes. The majority of these operations-driven emissions are fugitive emissions from the gas delivery systems of Registrants PECO, BGE, and DPL. The remaining 4.9 million metric tons, approximately 92%, are the indirect emissions associated with the electric transmission and distribution system and primarily consists of losses resulting from the Utility Registrant's delivery of electricity to their customers (line losses). These emissions are driven primarily by customer demand for electricity and the mix of generation assets supplying energy to the electric grid. The Registrants do not own generation and must comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements governing procurement of electricity for delivery to retail customers and use of the system to support other transmission transactions. However, the Registrants do engage in efforts that help to reduce these emissions, including customer programs to drive customer energy efficiency, to help manage peak demands, and to enable distributed solar generation. \nIn August 2021, Exelon announced a Path to Clean goal to collectively reduce its operations-driven GHG emissions 50% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline, and to reach net-zero operations-driven GHG emissions by 2050, while also supporting customers and communities to achieve their clean energy and emissions reduction goals. Exelon’s quantitative goals include its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions with the exception of Scope 2 line losses, and build upon Exelon's long-standing commitment to reducing our GHG emissions. Exelon's activities in support of the Path to Clean goal will include efficiency and clean electricity for operations, vehicle fleet electrification, equipment and processes to reduce sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) leakage, investments in natural gas infrastructure to minimize methane leaks and increase safety and reliability, and investment and collaboration to develop new technologies. Beyond 2030, Exelon recognizes that technology advancement and continued policy support will be needed to ensure achievement of its net-zero goal by 2050. Exelon is laying the groundwork by partnering with national labs, universities, and research consortia to research, develop, and pilot clean technologies, as well as working with our states, jurisdictions, and policy makers to understand the scope and scale of energy transformation, and policies and incentives, needed to reach local ambitions for GHG emissions reductions. The Utility Registrants are also supporting customers and communities to achieve their clean energy and emissions goals through significant energy efficiency programs. Estimated customer program energy efficiency investments across the Utility Registrants for 2025 — 2028 total $4.9 billion. These programs enable customer savings through home energy audits, discounts on efficient lighting, appliance recycling, home improvement rebates, equipment upgrade incentives, and innovative programs like smart thermostats and combined heat and power programs.\nAs an energy delivery company, Exelon can play a role in helping to reduce GHG emissions in its service territories. In connecting end users of energy to electric and gas supply, Exelon can leverage its assets and customer interface to help support efficient use of lower emitting resources as they become available. Electrification, where feasible, for transportation, buildings, and industry coupled with simultaneous decarbonization of electric generation, can be an important means to reduce emissions. Exelon is advocating for public policy supportive of vehicle electrification, investing in enabling infrastructure and technology, and supporting customer education and adoption. In addition, the Utility Registrants have a goal to electrify 30% of their own vehicle fleet by 2025, increasing to 50% by 2030. Clean fuels and other emerging technologies can also support the transition, lessen the strain on electric system expansion, and support energy system resiliency. Exelon, and its registrants PECO, BGE, and DPL, which own gas distribution assets, are also continuing to explore these other decarbonization opportunities, supporting pilots of emerging energy technologies and clean fuels to support both operational and customer-driven emissions reductions. Exelon believes its market and business model could be significantly affected by the transition of the energy system, such as through an increased electric load and decreased demand for natural gas, potentially accompanied by changes in technology, customer expectations, and/or regulatory structures. See the risk factor entitled \"The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry\" in ITEM 1A. of this report for additional information.\nClimate Change Adaptation\nThe Registrants' facilities and operations are subject to the impacts of global climate change. Long-term shifts in climactic patterns, such as sustained higher temperatures and sea level rise, may present challenges for the Registrants and their service territories. Exelon believes its operations could be significantly affected by the physical risks of climate change. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information related to the Registrants' risks associated with climate change. \nThe Registrants' assets undergo seasonal readiness efforts to ensure that they are prepared for the weather projections for the summer and winter months. The Registrants consider and review national climate assessments to inform their planning. Each of the Utility Registrants also has well established system recovery plans and is investing in its systems to install advanced equipment and reinforce the local electric system, making it more weather resistant and less vulnerable to anticipated storm damage.\nInternational Climate Change Agreements. At the international level, the United States has been a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Parties to the UNFCCC adopted the Paris Agreement at the 21st session of the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 21) on December 12, 2015. Under the Agreement, which became effective on November 4, 2016, the parties committed to try to limit the global average temperature increase and to develop national GHG reduction commitments. Though under the first Trump Administration, the United States formally withdrew from the Paris Agreement, on January 20, 2021, President Biden accepted the Agreement, which resulted in the United States’ formal re-entry on February \n19, 2021. Following this reentry, the United States set an economy-wide target of reducing its net GHG emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. On November 11, 2022, at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP 27), President Biden recommitted the U.S. to these goals and detailed the significant domestic climate actions the U.S. had taken to spur a new era of clean American manufacturing, enhance energy security, and drive down the costs of clean energy for consumers in the U.S. and around the world. In January 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order instructing the federal government to begin the actions needed to withdraw from the Paris Agreement again. This withdrawal process will take a year to complete. President Trump also issued an Executive Order calling for many of the clean energy programs created under IIJA and the IRA to be suspended for 90 days while they are reviewed.\nState Climate Change Legislation and Regulation. A number of states in which the Registrants operate have state and regional programs to reduce GHG emissions and renewable and other portfolio standards, which impact the power sector. See discussion below for additional information on renewable and other portfolio standards.\nCertain northeast and mid-Atlantic states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont) currently participate in the RGGI. The program requires most fossil fuel-fired power plant owners and operators in the region to hold allowances, purchased at auction, for each ton of CO2 emissions. Non-emitting resources do not have to purchase or hold these allowances.\nBroader state programs impact other sectors as well, such as the District of Columbia's Clean Energy DC Omnibus Act and cross-sector GHG reduction plans, which resulted in recent requirements for Pepco to develop a 15-year decarbonization program and strategy. Maryland expects to meet and exceed the mandate set in the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Act to reduce statewide GHG emissions 40% (from 2006 levels) by 2030, and the state’s Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 further updates requirements with a proposal to reduce emissions 60% (from 2006 levels) by 2031 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. New Jersey accelerated its goals through Executive Order 274, which establishes an interim goal of 50% reductions below 2006 levels by 2030 and affirms its goal of achieving 80% reductions by 2050 and includes programs to drive greater amounts of electrified transportation. Delaware's Climate Change Solutions Act, established in August 2023, sets a statewide GHG emissions reduction goal of 50% by Jan 1, 2030 and a net-zero GHG emissions goal by Jan 1, 2050, on a net basis as compared to a 2005 baseline. Illinois’ climate bill, CEJA, establishes decarbonization requirements for the state to transition to 100% clean energy by 2050 and supports programs to improve energy efficiency, manage energy demand, attract clean energy investment, and accelerate job creation. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on CEJA. \nThe Registrants cannot predict the nature of future regulations or how such regulations might impact future financial statements. See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS for additional information related to the Registrants' risks associated with climate legislation. \nRenewable and Clean Energy Standards. Each of the states where Exelon operates have adopted some form of renewable or clean energy procurement requirement. These standards impose varying levels of mandates for procurement of renewable or clean electricity (the definition of which varies by state) and/or energy efficiency. These are generally expressed as a percentage of annual electric load, often increasing by year. The Utility Registrants comply with these various requirements through acquiring sufficient bundled or unbundled credits such as RECs, CMCs, or ZECs, or paying an alternative compliance payment, and/or a combination of these compliance alternatives. The Utility Registrants are permitted to recover from retail customers the costs of complying with their state RPS requirements, including the procurement of RECs or other alternative energy resources. See Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Environmental Regulation\nWater Quality\nUnder the federal Clean Water Act, NPDES permits for discharges into waterways are required to be obtained from the EPA or from the state environmental agency to which the permit program has been delegated, and \npermits must be renewed periodically. Certain of Exelon's facilities discharge water into waterways and are therefore subject to these regulations and operate under NPDES permits. \nUnder Clean Water Act Section 404 and state laws and regulations, the Registrants may be required to obtain permits for projects involving dredge or fill activities in waters of the United States. What constitutes a Water of the United States has been subject to varied definition over the past several Administrations. The most recent definitions established under the Biden Administration are subject to pending legal challenge. It is expected that, under the Trump Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency will issue new regulations that reflect a more narrow scope.\nWhere Registrants’ facilities are required to secure a federal license or permit for activities that may result in a discharge to covered waters, they may be required to obtain a state water quality certification under Clean Water Act section 401. \nSolid and Hazardous Waste and Environmental Remediation\nCERCLA provides for response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in the event of threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances. CERCLA authorizes the EPA either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the situation to do so. Under CERCLA, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of hazardous waste sites, are strictly, jointly, and severally liable for the cleanup costs of hazardous substances at sites, many of which are listed by the EPA on the National Priorities List (NPL). These PRPs can be ordered to perform a cleanup, can be sued for costs associated with an EPA-directed cleanup, may voluntarily settle with the EPA concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or may voluntarily begin a site investigation and site remediation, under EPA oversight. Most states have also enacted statutes that contain provisions substantially similar to CERCLA. Such statutes apply in many states where the Registrants currently own or operate, or previously owned or operated, facilities, including Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. In addition, RCRA governs treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, and cleanup of sites where such activities were conducted.\nThe Registrants’ operations have in the past, and may in the future, require substantial expenditures in order to comply with these federal and state environmental laws. Under these laws, the Registrants may be liable for the costs of remediating environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by them and of property contaminated by hazardous substances generated by them. The Registrants own or lease a number of real estate parcels, including parcels on which their operations or the operations of others may have resulted in contamination by substances that are considered hazardous under environmental laws. The Registrants and their subsidiaries are, or could become in the future, parties to proceedings initiated by the EPA, state agencies, and/or other responsible parties under CERCLA and RCRA or similar state laws with respect to a number of sites or may undertake to investigate and remediate sites for which they may be subject to enforcement actions by an agency or third-party. \nComEd’s and PECO’s environmental liabilities primarily arise from contamination at former MGP sites, which were operated by ComEd's and PECO's predecessor companies. ComEd, pursuant to an ICC order, and PECO, pursuant to settlements of natural gas distribution rate cases with the PAPUC, have an on-going process to recover certain environmental remediation costs of the MGP sites through a provision within customer rates. BGE, Pepco, DPL, and ACE do not have material contingent liabilities relating to MGP sites. The amount to be expended in 2025 for activities associated with the environmental investigation and remediation related to contamination at former MGP sites and other gas purification sites is estimated to be approximately $14 million, which consists primarily of $9 million at PECO.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Registrants have established appropriate contingent liabilities for environmental remediation requirements. In addition, the Registrants may be required to make significant additional expenditures not presently determinable for other environmental remediation costs.\nSee Note 3 — Regulatory Matters and Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Registrants’ environmental matters, remediation efforts, and related impacts to the Registrants’ Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInformation about our Executive Officers as of February 12, 2025\nExelon\n\nName                                         Age   Position                                                                         Period\nButler Jr., Calvin G.                     55       President and Chief Executive Officer, Exelon                            2022 - Present\n                                                   Chief Operating Officer, Exelon                                             2021 - 2022\n                                                   Senior Executive Vice President, Exelon                                     2019 - 2022\n                                                   Chief Executive Officer, Exelon Utilities                                   2019 - 2022\n                                                   Chief Executive Officer, BGE                                                2014 - 2019\nGlockner, David                           64       Executive Vice President, Compliance, Audit and Risk, Exelon             2020 - Present\n                                                   Chief Compliance Officer, Citadel LLC                                       2017 - 2020\nHonorable, Colette                            54   Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary                              2024 - Present\n                                                   Executive Vice President, Public Policy                                     2023 - 2024\n                                                   Chief External Affairs Officer                                              2023 - 2024\n                                                   Partner, Reed Smith LLP                                                     2017 - 2023\nInnocenzo, Michael A.                         59   Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Exelon             2024 - Present\n                                                   President and Chief Executive Officer, PECO                                 2018 - 2024\nJones, Jeanne                             45       Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Exelon             2022 - Present\n                                                   Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance, Exelon                            2021 - 2022\n                                                   Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, ComEd                    2018 - 2021\nKleczynski, Robert A.                     56       Senior Vice President, Controller and Tax, Exelon                        2023 - Present\n                                                   Senior Vice President, Exelon                                               2020 - 2023\n                                                   Vice President, Exelon                                                      2018 - 2020\n                                                   General Tax Officer, Exelon                                                 2018 - 2023\nComEd\n\nName                                   Age   Position                                                                                        Period\nQuiniones, Gil                      58       President, ComEd                                                                        2024 - Present\n                                             Chief Executive Officer, ComEd                                                          2021 - Present\n                                             President and Chief Executive Officer, New York Power Authority                            2011 - 2021\nBinswanger, Lewis                   65       Senior Vice President, Governmental, Regulatory and External Affairs, ComEd             2022 - Present\n                                             Vice President, External Affairs, Nicor Gas                                                2013 - 2022\nLevin, Joshua                       45       Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer &amp;

      "text": "\nITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS      \nEach of the Registrants operates in a complex market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond that Registrant’s direct control. A number of these risks, any of which could negatively affect one or more of the Registrants’ future Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and/or Consolidated Balance Sheets (consolidated financial statements), are captured below. Although the risks are generally organized by category and separately described, many of these risks are interrelated. Additionally, the risks should be considered holistically with other information included in this filing and future filings with the SEC. There may be further risks and uncertainties that are presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that could negatively affect the Registrants' future consolidated financial statements. \nRisks Related to Legislative, Regulatory, and Legal Factors\nThe Registrants' businesses are highly regulated and electric and gas revenue and earnings could be negatively affected by legislative and/or regulatory actions (All Registrants).\nSubstantial aspects of the Registrants' businesses are subject to comprehensive Federal or state legislation and/or regulation. \nThe Utility Registrants' consolidated financial statements are heavily dependent on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs associated with the retail purchase, transmission, and distribution of power and natural gas to their customers.\nFundamental changes in laws or regulations or adverse legislative or regulatory actions affecting the Registrants’ businesses would require changes in their business planning models and operations. Registrants cannot always predict when or whether legislative or regulatory action will occur and may not be able to influence the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives.\nChanges in the Utility Registrants' respective terms and conditions of service, including their respective rates, along with adoption of new rate structures and constructs, or establishment of new rate cases, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings and/or negotiated settlements that are at times contentious, lengthy, and subject to appeal, which lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result, and which could result in uncertainties in rate case outcomes, and/or introduce time delays in effectuating rate changes (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services, adoption of new rate structures and constructs or establishment of new rate cases. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. Decisions are subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with the approval proceedings. The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient for a Utility Registrant to recover its costs once the rates become effective. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates including recovery mechanisms for costs associated with the procurement of electricity or gas, credit losses, MGP remediation, smart grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency and demand response programs, could be adjusted, subject to refund, or disallowed. In certain instances, the Utility Registrants could agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters, customer initiatives, or franchise agreements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the ability of the Utility Registrants to recover their costs or earn an adequate return. \nIn addition to potential timing delays, the Registrants also face other uncertainties in rate proceedings that could impact recovery, including not obtaining anticipated allowed rates of return, allowed capital structures, or allowed return on pension assets, and various other factors.\nSee Note 3 — Regulatory Matters of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be subject to higher costs and/or penalties related to mandatory reliability standards, including the likely exposure of the Utility Registrants to the results of NERC compliance requirements (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants as users, owners, and operators of the bulk power transmission system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and enforced by FERC. The standards are based on the functions that need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and are guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with or changes in the reliability standards could subject the Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures. In addition, the ICC, PAPUC, MDPSC, DCPSC, DEPSC, and NJBPU impose certain distribution reliability standards on the Utility Registrants. If the Utility Registrants were found in non-compliance with the Federal or state mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to remediation costs as well as sanctions, which could include substantial monetary penalties.\nThe Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local, state, and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the way the Registrants conduct their operations and make capital expenditures, including how they handle air and water emissions, hazardous and solid waste, and activities affecting surface waters, groundwater, and aquatic and other species. Violations of these requirements could subject the Registrants to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs for remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties and exposure to third parties’ claims for alleged health or property damages, or operating restrictions to achieve compliance. In addition, the Registrants are subject to liability under these laws for the remediation costs for environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned by the Registrants and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generated or released. Remediation activities associated with MGP operations conducted by predecessor companies are one component of such costs. Also, the Registrants are currently involved in several proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been deposited and could be subject to additional proceedings in the future. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS — Environmental Matters and Regulation for additional information.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by federal and state RPS, energy conservation and GHG reduction legislation and regulation, and/or changing customer expectations, along with energy conservation by customers (All Registrants).\nRisks include changes to energy systems due to new technologies, changing customer expectations and/or voluntary GHG goals, as well as local, state, or federal regulatory requirements intended to reduce GHG emissions and/or mandate implementation of energy conservation programs, including through limitation of the use of natural gas. Changes to current state legislation or the development of Federal legislation that requires the use of low-emission, renewable, and/or alternate fuel sources could significantly impact the Utility Registrants, especially if timely cost recovery is not allowed. \nFederal and state legislation mandating the implementation of energy conservation programs that require the implementation of new technologies, such as smart grid, DERs and energy efficiency programs, could increase capital expenditures and could significantly impact the Utility Registrants' consolidated financial statements if timely cost recovery is not allowed. These energy conservation programs, regulated energy consumption reduction targets, and new energy consumption technologies could cause declines in customer energy consumption and lead to a decline in the Registrants' earnings, if timely recovery is not allowed.\nThe Registrants also periodically perform analyses of potential energy system transition pathways to reduce economy-wide GHG emissions to mitigate climate change. To the extent additional GHG reduction legislation and/or regulation becomes effective at the Federal and/or state levels, the Registrants could incur costs to further limit the GHG emissions from their operations or otherwise comply with applicable requirements and such legislation and/or regulation could otherwise adversely affect the Registrants' businesses. See ITEM 1. BUSINESS — Environmental Matters and Regulation — Renewable and Clean Energy Standards and \"The Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry\" above for additional information. \nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by challenges to tax positions taken, tax law changes, and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions. (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are required to make judgments to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities, which includes general tax positions taken and associated reserves established. Tax obligations include, but are not limited to: income, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes and ongoing appeal issues related to these tax matters. All tax estimates could be subject to challenge by the tax authorities. Additionally, earnings may be impacted due to changes in federal or local/state tax laws, and the inherent difficulty of estimating potential tax effects of ongoing business decisions. See Note 1 — Significant Accounting Policies and Note 13 — Income Taxes of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLegal proceedings could result in a negative outcome, which the Registrants cannot predict (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising out of their business operations. The material legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising out of business operations are summarized in Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Adverse outcomes in these proceedings could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenue, or restrict or disrupt business activities. \nThe Registrants could be subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make them vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other consequences (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants could be the subject of public criticism. Adverse publicity could render public service commissions and other regulatory and legislative authorities less likely to view energy companies generally, or the Registrants specifically, in a favorable light, and could cause the Registrants to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements. \nThe activities associated with the past Deferred Prosecution Agreement and the now resolved associated SEC investigation could have a material adverse effect on Exelon’s and ComEd’s reputation and relationship with legislators, regulators, and customers that could affect their ability to achieve actions and approvals (Exelon and ComEd).\nOn July 17, 2020, ComEd entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the USAO for the Northern District of Illinois to resolve the USAO’s investigation into Exelon’s and ComEd’s lobbying activities in the State of Illinois. Exelon was not made a party to the DPA and no charges were brought against Exelon. Under the DPA, the USAO filed a single charge alleging that ComEd improperly gave and offered to give jobs, vendor subcontracts, and payments associated with those jobs and subcontracts for the benefit of the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives and the Speaker’s associates, with the intent to influence the Speaker’s action regarding legislation affecting ComEd’s interests. The DPA provided that the USAO would defer any prosecution of such charge and any other criminal or civil case against ComEd in connection with the matters identified therein for a three-year period. That period expired, and the pending charge was dismissed, in July 2023. In October 2019, the SEC notified Exelon and ComEd that it had opened an investigation into their lobbying activities in the state of Illinois. On September 28, 2023, Exelon and ComEd reached a settlement with the SEC to fully resolve the matter.\nThe DPA and the settlement with the SEC could have a material adverse impact on Exelon’s and ComEd’s reputation or relationships with regulatory and legislative authorities, customers, and other stakeholders. Those impacts could affect, or make more difficult, their efforts to achieve actions or approvals associated with operations. See Note 18 — Commitments and Contingencies of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the DPA and SEC settlement.\nRisks Related to Operational Factors\nThe Utility Registrants' operating costs are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational systems (All Registrants).\nFailures of the equipment or facilities used in the Utility Registrants' delivery systems could interrupt electric transmission and/or electric or natural gas delivery, which could result in a loss of revenues and an increase in maintenance and capital expenditures. Equipment or facilities failures can occur due to several factors, including natural causes such as weather or information systems failure. Specifically, if the implementation of AMI, smart grid, or other technologies in the Utility Registrants' service territory fail to perform as intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information systems, or if any of the financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Utility Registrants' financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, dependence upon automated systems could further increase the risk that operational system flaws or internal and/or external tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nRegulated utilities, which are required to provide service to all customers within their respective service territories, have generally been afforded liability protections against claims by customers relating to failure of service. Under Illinois law, however, ComEd could be required to pay damages to its customers in some circumstances involving extended outages affecting large numbers of its customers, which could be material.\nThe Registrants are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risks (All Registrants).\nRisks from cybersecurity and physical threats to energy infrastructures are increasing. Threat actors, including sophisticated nation-state actors and criminal groups, exploit potential vulnerabilities in the electric and natural gas utility industry, grid infrastructure, and other energy infrastructures. Attacks and disruptions, which could involve physical, cyber, and hybrid targeting of physical and cyber assets, are increasingly sophisticated and dynamic. The increased implementation of, and reliance on, information technologies and networks to manage business operations, including the operation of technical systems, as well as the Registrants' use of numerous vendors and suppliers, create additional points of vulnerability that could be, and in certain instances have been, exploited by malicious threat actors. Several U.S. government agencies have warned that the energy sector and its supply chains are subject to increasing risks of physical attacks, ransomware attacks and cybersecurity threats, and that the risks may escalate during periods of heightened geopolitical tensions. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify the Registrants' cybersecurity risks. \nA security breach of the Registrants' physical assets or information systems or those of the Registrants' competitors, vendors, business partners and interconnected entities (including RTOs and ISOs) could materially impact Registrants by, among other things, impairing the availability of electricity and gas distributed by Registrants and/or the reliability of transmission and distribution systems, damaging grid infrastructure, interrupting critical business functions, impairing the availability of vendor services and materials that the Registrants rely on to maintain their operations, or by leading to the theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including critical infrastructure information, system data and architecture, sensitive customer, vendor, or employee data, or other confidential data. While Registrants and some of the Registrants' vendors have experienced cybersecurity incidents, such incidents have not, to Registrants' knowledge, resulted in material impact to any of the Registrants to date.\nIf a material physical or cybersecurity breach or disruption were to occur, the Registrants' reputation could be negatively affected, customer confidence in the Registrants could be diminished and the Registrants could be subject to legal claims, regulatory exposure, loss of revenues, and increased costs, including infrastructure repairs or operations shutdown, all of which could materially affect the Registrants' financial condition and materially damage their business reputation. Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance maintained against losses resulting from any such security breaches or disruptions may not be sufficient to cover losses or otherwise adequately compensate for any resulting business disruptions. The continued increase in Federal and state regulatory requirements related to cybersecurity and evolving threat actor-capabilities could require changes to measures currently undertaken by the Registrants or to their business operations and could adversely affect their consolidated financial statements.\nThe Registrants’ electricity and natural gas operations are inherently hazardous and involve significant risks to employees, contractors, customers, and the general public (All Registrants).\nEmployees and contractors throughout the organization work in, and customers and the general public could be exposed to, potentially dangerous environments near the Registrants’ operations. As a result, employees, contractors, customers, and the general public may face, and in the past have experienced, serious injury, including loss of life, damage to or destruction of facilities and residences, business interruptions, and environmental pollution. These risks include, among others, gas explosions, uncontrolled release of natural gas and other environmental hazards, fires, pole strikes, and electric contact cases. Further, the location of natural gas pipelines and associated distribution facilities, or electric generation, transmission, substations and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, increases the potential damages resulting from these risks.\nExtreme weather events, natural disasters, operational accidents such as wildfires or natural gas explosions, war, acts and threats of terrorism or sabotage, cyberattacks or compromises, equipment or process failures, public health crises, or other significant events could negatively impact the Registrants' results of operations, ability to raise capital and future growth (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants' infrastructures and/or operations could be affected by extreme weather events, natural disasters, operational accidents such as wildfires or natural gas explosions or equipment or process failures due to aging infrastructure or otherwise, each of which could result in increased costs, including supply chain costs and claims for third-party property damage. An extreme weather event, natural disaster, wildfire, or operational accident within the Utility Registrants’ service areas can also directly affect their capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment. \nThe Registrants face a risk that their operations would be direct targets or indirect casualties of attacks or sabotaged by nation-states or their agents, or by foreign or domestic terrorist groups. Responses to such attacks or sabotage, and any resulting retaliatory actions or sustained conflict could affect the Registrants’ operations and finances in unpredictable and material ways. Furthermore, such events could compromise the physical or cybersecurity of the Registrants' facilities, which could adversely affect the Registrants' ability to manage their businesses effectively. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, war, natural disasters, public health crises, epidemics, pandemics, credit crises, recession, or other significant events also could result in a decline in energy consumption or interruption of fuel or the supply chain. In addition, the implementation of security guidelines and measures has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased costs.\nThe Registrants could be significantly affected by public health crises, including epidemics or pandemics. The Registrants have plans in place to respond to such events. However, depending on the severity and the resulting impacts to workforce and other resource availability, a public health crisis, epidemic, or pandemic could adversely affect our vendors, or customers and customer demand as well as the Registrants’ ability to operate their transmission and distribution assets.\nIn addition, Exelon, on behalf of the Registrants, maintains a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property, casualty, third party liability, and cybersecurity losses subject to unforeseen occurrences or catastrophic events that could damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations. However, such losses may not be covered under applicable insurance policies, or the amount of insurance may be inadequate to cover all such losses.\nThe Registrants are subject to risks associated with climate change (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants periodically perform analyses to better understand long-term projections of climate change and how those changes in the physical environments where they operate could affect their facilities and operations. The Registrants primarily operate in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic of the United States, areas that historically have been prone to various types of severe weather events, and the Registrants have well-developed response and recovery programs based on these historical events. However, the Registrants’ physical facilities could be at greater risk of damage as changes in the global climate affect temperature and weather patterns, including if \nsuch climate changes result in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, elevated or decreased levels of precipitation, sea level rise, increased surface water temperatures, wildfires and/or other effects. \nIn addition, changes to the climate may impact levels and patterns of demand for energy and related services, which could affect Registrants’ operations and business.\nThe Registrants’ businesses are capital intensive, and their assets could require significant expenditures to maintain, are subject to operational failure and could be impacted by lack of availability of labor, materials or parts, which could result in potential liability (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants’ businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. Equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good utility practices, is subject to operational failure, including events that are beyond the Utility Registrants’ control, and could require significant expenditures to operate efficiently. Disruptions or cost increases in the supply chain, including shortages in labor, materials or parts, or significant increases in relevant tariffs, could materially impact the timing and execution of capital projects, and the timing of placing assets in service, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. In recent years, the energy industry has been experiencing shortages of, and long lead times for, critical equipment such as transformers and conductors. The Registrants' consolidated financial statements could be negatively affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital projects or raise the necessary capital, or if they are deemed liable for operational failure. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information regarding the Registrants’ potential future capital expenditures.\nLack of sufficient generation to meet actual or forecasted demand or disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt transmission and distribution services, impair economic development, cause outages, and result in use limitations or affordability implications for customers. (All Registrants)\nExelon does not generate the electricity it delivers. The Utility Registrants purchase, transmit, and distribute electric power obtained from power generation facilities owned by third parties. This power is primarily procured through contracts as directed by the Utility Registrants’ respective state laws and regulatory commission actions from various approved bidders or from purchases on the PJM operated markets. Third-party power generation may be insufficient to meet our customers’ electricity demand in the short- and medium-term because of extreme weather, fuel security, market procurement, regulatory requirements, operational issues, maintenance outages, inflexibility of demand, or financial uncertainty impacting existing or prospective generation facilities. Faster energy demand growth, acceleration of generator retirements, or the limited entry of new generating resources in any of the Utility Registrants’ respective service territories may result in a longer-term power generation capacity shortfall. Exelon has forecast substantial increases in load, driven largely by the increasing use of data processing facilities dedicated to artificial intelligence technologies. If third-party power generation capacity is insufficient to meet any Utility Registrant’s customers’ electricity demand or customers’ electricity demand across PJM over any period, transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected. \nIn the event generation capacity is insufficient to meet demand, the Utility Registrants’ customers may experience greater price volatility, power service outages during peak demand periods or during generation contingencies (e.g., severe storms), and electricity use limits to maintain system balance. Furthermore, the Utility Registrants may be unable to support new economic development should generation constraints last for extended periods.\nThe Utility Registrants' respective ability to deliver electricity, their operating costs, and their capital expenditures could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion and failures of neighboring transmission systems (All Registrants).\nDemand for electricity within the Utility Registrants' service areas could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage. Also, insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the Utility Registrants' ability to comply with reliability standards and strain customer and regulatory agency relationships. As is the case for electric utilities generally, potential concerns over transmission capacity or generation facility retirements could result in PJM or FERC requiring the \nUtility Registrants to upgrade or expand their respective transmission systems through additional capital expenditures. Delays in siting, permitting, and interconnection could defer the introduction of new generation resources that could address resource adequacy concerns.\nPJM’s systems and operations are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities. However, service interruptions at other utilities may cause interruptions in the Utility Registrants’ service areas. Additionally, efforts to artificially manipulate power demand on the grid, or even accidental activity that results in sharp fluctuations of demand, could disrupt grid operations.\nThe Registrants' performance could be negatively affected if they fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce (All Registrants).\nCertain factors, such as employee strikes, work stoppages, loss of employees, loss of contract resources due to a major event, inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on commercially reasonable terms, an aging workforce, mismatching of skill sets for current and future needs, and failing to appropriately anticipate future workforce needs, could lead to operating challenges and increased costs for the Registrants. Such challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Such events and other factors could result in increased costs, including costs of replacing lost labor through contractors or new hires, training costs, and costs of lost productivity. Such events also could increase operational risks. The Registrants are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employees needed to conduct Registrants' transmission and distribution operations as well as areas where new technologies are pertinent. \nThe Registrants’ performance could be negatively affected by poor performance of third-party contractors that perform periodic or ongoing work (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants rely on third-party contractors to perform operations, maintenance, and construction work. Performance standards typically are included in all contractual obligations, but poor performance may impact capital execution plans or operations, or have adverse financial, regulatory, or reputational consequences.\nThe Registrants could make acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and new markets, which may not be successful or achieve the intended financial results (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants face risks associated with regulator-mandated or other new business initiatives, such as smart grids and broader beneficial electrification. Such risks include, but are not limited to, cost recovery, regulatory concerns, cybersecurity, and obsolescence of technology. Such initiatives may not be successful, and failures could result in adverse financial or reputational consequences.\nRisks Related to Market and Financial Factors\nThe Registrants are potentially affected by emerging technologies that could over time affect or transform the energy industry (All Registrants).\nAdvancements in power generation technology, including commercial and residential solar generation installations and commercial micro turbine installations, are improving the cost-effectiveness of customer self-supply of electricity. Improvements in energy storage technology, including batteries and fuel cells, could also better position customers to meet their around-the-clock electricity requirements. Improvements in energy efficiency of lighting, appliances, equipment and building materials will also affect energy consumption by customers. Changes in power generation, storage, and use technologies could have significant effects on customer behaviors and their energy consumption.\nThese developments could affect levels of customer-owned generation, customer expectations, and current business models and make portions of the Utility Registrants' transmission and/or distribution facilities uneconomic prior to the end of their useful lives. Increasing pressure from both the private and public sectors to take actions to mitigate climate change could also push the speed and nature of this transition. These factors could affect the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements through, among other things, increased Operating \nand maintenance expenses, increased capital expenditures, and potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation over shortened remaining asset useful lives.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by unstable capital and credit markets (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants rely on the capital markets, particularly for publicly offered debt, as well as the banking and commercial paper markets, to meet their financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets in the United States or abroad could negatively affect the Registrants’ ability to access the capital markets or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facilities. The banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to the Registrants if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. The inability to access capital markets or credit facilities, and longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets because of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditures, or require a reduction in dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. In addition, the Registrants have exposure to worldwide financial markets, including Europe, Canada, and Asia. Disruptions in these markets could reduce or restrict the Registrants’ ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable terms. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 17%, 11%, and 17% of the Registrants’ available credit facilities were with European, Canadian, and Asian banks, respectively. Additionally, higher interest rates may put pressure on the Registrants’ overall liquidity profile, financial health and impact financial results. See Note 16 — Debt and Credit Agreements of the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the credit facilities.\nIf any of the Registrants were to experience a downgrade in its credit ratings to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standards in its agreements with its counterparties or regulatory financial requirements, it would be required to provide significant amounts of collateral that could affect its liquidity and could experience higher borrowing costs (All Registrants).\nThe Utility Registrants' operating agreements with PJM and PECO's, BGE's, and DPL's natural gas procurement contracts contain collateral provisions that are affected by their credit rating and market prices. If certain wholesale market conditions were to exist and the Utility Registrants were to lose their investment grade credit ratings (based on their senior unsecured debt ratings), they would be required to provide collateral in the forms of letters of credit or cash, which could have a material adverse effect upon their remaining sources of liquidity. PJM collateral posting requirements will generally increase as market prices rise and decrease as market prices fall. Collateral posting requirements for PECO, BGE, and DPL, with respect to their natural gas supply contracts, will generally increase as forward market prices fall and decrease as forward market prices rise. If the Utility Registrants were downgraded, they could experience higher borrowing costs as a result of the downgrade. In addition, changes in ratings methodologies by the agencies could also have an adverse negative impact on the ratings of the Utility Registrants. \nThe Utility Registrants conduct their respective businesses and operate under governance models and other arrangements and procedures intended to assure that the Utility Registrants are treated as separate, independent companies, distinct from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in order to isolate the Utility Registrants from Exelon and other Exelon subsidiaries in the event of financial difficulty at Exelon or another Exelon subsidiary. These measures (commonly referred to as “ring-fencing”) could help avoid or limit a downgrade in the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants in the event of a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon. Despite these ring-fencing measures, the credit ratings of the Utility Registrants could remain linked, to some degree, to the credit ratings of Exelon. Consequently, a reduction in the credit rating of Exelon could result in a reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the Utility Registrants. A reduction in the credit rating of a Utility Registrant could have a material adverse effect on the Utility Registrant.\nSee ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Credit Matters and Cash Requirements — Security Ratings for additional information regarding the potential impacts of credit downgrades on the Registrants’ cash flows.\nThe impacts of significant economic downturns or increases in customer rates, could lead to decreased volumes delivered and increased expense for uncollectible customer balances (All Registrants).\nThe impacts of significant economic downturns on the Utility Registrants' customers and the related regulatory limitations on residential service terminations for the Utility Registrants, could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balances and related expense. Further, increases in customer rates, including those related to increases in Purchased power and natural gas prices, could result in declines in customer usage and lower revenues for the Utility Registrants that do not have decoupling mechanisms. \nSee ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK for additional information on the Registrants’ credit risk.\nThe Registrants could be negatively affected by the impacts of weather (All Registrants).\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. Moderate temperatures adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting operating revenues at PECO and DPL Delaware. Due to revenue decoupling, operating revenues from electric distribution at ComEd, BGE, Pepco, DPL Maryland, and ACE and gas distribution at BGE are not intended to be affected by abnormal weather. \nExtreme weather conditions or damage resulting from storms could stress the Utility Registrants' transmission and distribution systems, communication systems, and technology, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs and limiting each Utility Registrant's ability to meet peak customer demand. First and third quarter financial results, in particular, are substantially dependent on weather conditions, and could make period comparisons less relevant.\nClimate change projections suggest increases to summer temperature and humidity trends, as well as more erratic precipitation and storm patterns over the long-term in the areas where the Utility Registrants have transmission and distribution assets. The frequency in which weather conditions emerge outside the current expected climate norms could contribute to weather-related impacts discussed above.\nLong-lived assets, goodwill, and other assets could become impaired (All Registrants).\nLong-lived assets represent the single largest asset class on the Registrants’ statements of financial position. In addition, Exelon, ComEd, and PHI have material goodwill balances. \nThe Registrants evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used whenever events or circumstances indicating a potential impairment exist. Factors such as, but not limited to, the business climate, including current and future energy and market conditions, environmental regulation, and the condition of assets are considered. \nComEd and PHI perform an assessment for possible impairment of their goodwill at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting units below their carrying amount. Regulatory actions or changes in significant assumptions, including discount and growth rates, utility sector market performance and transactions, projected operating and capital cash flows for ComEd’s, Pepco’s, DPL’s, and ACE’s business, and the fair value of debt, could potentially result in future impairments of Exelon’s, ComEd's, and PHI’s goodwill. \nAn impairment would require the Registrants to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset or goodwill to fair value through a non-cash charge to expense by the amount of the impairment. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Note 7 — Property, Plant, and Equipment, Note 11 — Asset Impairments, and Note 12 — Intangible Assets of the Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on long-lived asset impairments and goodwill impairments.\nThe Registrants could incur substantial costs in the event of non-performance by third-parties under indemnification agreements, or when the Registrants have guaranteed their performance (All Registrants).\nThe Registrants have entered into various agreements with counterparties that require those counterparties to reimburse a Registrant and hold it harmless against specified obligations and claims. To the extent that any of these counterparties are affected by deterioration in their creditworthiness or the agreements are otherwise determined to be unenforceable, the affected Registrant could be held responsible for the obligations. Each of the Utility Registrants has transferred its former generation assets to one or more third parties and in each case the transferee has agreed to assume certain obligations and to indemnify the applicable Utility Registrant for such obligations. In connection with the restructurings under which ComEd, PECO, and BGE transferred their generating assets to Constellation, Constellation assumed certain of ComEd’s, PECO’s, and BGE's rights and obligations with respect to their former generation assets. Further, ComEd, PECO, and BGE have entered into agreements with third parties under which the third-party agreed to indemnify ComEd, PECO, or BGE for certain obligations related to their respective former generation assets that have been assumed by Constellation as part of the restructuring. If Constellation or a transferee of one of the Utility Registrant’s generation assets experienced events that reduced its creditworthiness or the indemnity arrangement became unenforceable, the applicable Utility Registrant could be liable for any existing or future claims. In addition, the Utility Registrants have residual liability under certain laws in connection with their former generation assets.\nThe Registrants have issued indemnities to third parties regarding environmental or other matters in connection with purchases and sales of assets, including several of the Utility Registrants in connection with Constellation's absorption of their former generating assets. The Registrants could incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations under these indemnities. \nThe Registrants have issued guarantees of the performance of third parties, which obligate the Registrants to perform if the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by those third parties, the Registrants could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. \nMarket performance and other factors could decrease the value of employee benefit plan assets and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligations, which then could require significant additional funding (All Registrants).\nDisruptions in the capital markets and their actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investments held within Exelon’s employee benefit plan trusts. The asset values are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which could fall below Exelon's projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and OPEB plan assets would increase the funding requirements associated with Exelon’s pension and OPEB plan obligations. Additionally, Exelon’s pension and OPEB plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit costs and funding requirements. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions or changes to Social Security or Medicare eligibility requirements could also increase the costs and funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and OPEB plans.
