      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS \nGeneral\nLinde plc is a public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland with its principal offices in the United Kingdom and United States. Linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is a major technological innovator in the industrial gases industry. Its primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, and acetylene, etc.). The company also designs and builds equipment that produces industrial gases and offers customers a wide range of gas production and processing services such as olefin plants, natural gas plants, air separation plants, hydrogen and synthesis gas plants and other types of plants. \nLinde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food and beverage, and electronics.\nLinde’s sales were $33,005 million, $32,854 million, and $33,364 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, for a discussion of consolidated sales and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to Linde’s reportable segments.\nIndustrial Gases Products and Manufacturing Processes\nAtmospheric gases are the highest volume products produced by Linde. Using ambient air as feedstock, Linde produces oxygen, nitrogen and argon through several air separation processes of which cryogenic air separation is the most prevalent. Linde is the market leader in the field of non-cryogenic air separation technologies for the production of industrial gases. As part of this process Linde also produces rare gases, such as krypton, neon, and xenon. As a pioneer and leader in industrial gases, Linde is continuously developing a wide range of proprietary and patented applications and technologies to produce, store, distribute and increase usage of its gases. These technologies open important new markets and provide customers with opportunities to reduce costs, by increasing their operational efficiencies, including vacuum pressure swing adsorption (“VPSA”) and membrane separation technology to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen on-site.\nProcess gases, including hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, specialty gases and acetylene are produced by other production methods.\nHydrogen is produced from a range of different feedstocks using a wide portfolio of technologies. Today, carbon intensity is used to designate and differentiate between the production processes and the respective feedstocks used to produce the molecule. The majority of conventional hydrogen currently produced by Linde is derived from natural gas or methane, using steam methane reformation (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) technology. Linde has a range of technologies to produce low-carbon hydrogen from fossil feedstocks, or renewable hydrogen from renewable energy (non-fossil feedstock). Both products are considered sources of clean energy. Low-carbon (blue) hydrogen is produced primarily from methane, by capturing carbon emissions from a hydrogen production plant and sequestering them subsurface for the long term. Renewable (green) hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy and water as feedstock. Other sources of low-carbon hydrogen are existing chemical and petrochemical processes, out of which Linde recovers hydrogen for subsequent treatment and cleaning to achieve ultra-high purity levels.\nCarbon monoxide can be produced by either steam methane reforming (SMR) or auto-thermal reforming (ATR) of natural gas or other feedstock such as naphtha, a by-product in the petrochemical industry. Most carbon dioxide comes as an industrial by-product, that is sourced from chemical plants, refineries and other processes or is recovered from natural carbon dioxide sources. Raw carbon dioxide is processed and purified in Linde’s plants to produce commercial and food-grade carbon dioxide. Helium is sourced from certain helium-rich natural gas streams in the United States, with additional supplies being acquired from outside the United States. Acetylene is primarily sourced as a chemical by-product, but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water. \nIndustrial Gases Distribution\nThere are three basic distribution methods for industrial gases: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. These distribution methods are often integrated, with products from all three supply modes coming from the same plant. The method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost means of meeting the customer’s needs, depending upon factors such as volume requirements, purity, pattern of usage, and the form in which the product is used (as a gas or as a cryogenic liquid).\nOn-site. Customers that require the largest volumes of product (typically oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen) and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10-20 years and containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Air separation technologies also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.\nMerchant. The merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, helium and carbon dioxide. The deliveries generally are made from Linde’s plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site which are usually owned and maintained by Linde and leased to the customer. Due to distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually three to seven-year requirement contracts.\nPackaged Gases. Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in metal containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Packaged gases include atmospheric gases, hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, acetylene and related products. Linde also produces and distributes in cylinders a wide range of specialty gases and mixtures. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Packaged gases are generally sold under one to three-year supply contracts and through purchase orders.\nEngineering\nLinde’s Engineering business has a global presence, with its focus on market segments such as air separation, hydrogen, synthesis, olefin and natural gas plants. The company utilizes its extensive process engineering expertise in the planning, design and construction of highly efficient plants for the production and processing of gases. With its state-of-the-art sustainable technologies Engineering also helps customers avoid, capture and utilize carbon dioxide emissions. Its technology portfolio covers the entire value chain for production, liquefaction, storage, distribution and application of hydrogen which supports the transition to clean energy. Its digital services and solutions increase plant efficiency and performance.\nLinde's plants are used in a wide variety of fields: in the petrochemical and chemical industries, in refineries and fertilizer plants, to recover air gases, to produce synthesis gases, to treat natural gas and to produce noble gases. The Engineering business either supplies plant components directly to the customer or to the industrial gas business of Linde which operates the plants under a long-term gases supply contract.\nInventories – Linde carries inventories of merchant and cylinder gases and hardgoods to supply products to its customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. On-site plants and pipeline complexes have limited inventory. Inventory obsolescence is not material to Linde’s business.\nCustomers – Linde is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers.\nInternational – Linde is a global enterprise with approximately 65% of its 2024 sales outside of the United States. The company also has majority or wholly owned subsidiaries that operate in approximately 45 European, Middle Eastern and African countries (including Germany, the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Sweden, and the Republic of South Africa); approximately 20 Asian and South Pacific countries (including China, Australia, India and South Korea); and approximately 20 countries in North and South America (including U.S., Canada, Mexico and Brazil).\nThe company also has equity method investments operating in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.\nLinde’s non-U.S. business is subject to risks customarily encountered in non-U.S. operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, import and export controls, and other economic, political and regulatory policies of local governments. Also, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nSeasonality – Linde’s business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any significant extent.\nResearch and Development – Linde’s research and development is directed toward development of gas processing, separation and liquefaction technologies, and clean energy technologies; improving distribution of industrial gases and the development of new markets and applications for these gases. This results in the development of new advanced air separation, hydrogen, synthesis gas, natural gas, adsorption and chemical process technologies; novel clean energy and carbon management solutions; as well as the frequent introduction of new industrial gas applications. Research and \ndevelopment is primarily conducted in Pullach, Germany, Tonawanda, New York, Burr Ridge, Illinois and Shanghai, China.\nPatents and Trademarks – Linde owns or licenses a large number of patents that relate to a wide variety of products and processes. Linde’s patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. While these patents and licenses are considered important to its individual businesses, Linde does not consider its business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any one particular patent, or patent license, or family of patents. Linde also owns a large number of trademarks, of which the \"Linde\" trademark is the most significant.\nRaw Materials and Energy Costs – Energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases. Most of Linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. The company mitigates electricity, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, cost pass–through and tolling arrangements.\nThe supply of energy has not typically been a significant issue in the geographic areas where the company conducts business. However, energy availability and price is unpredictable and may pose future risks.\nFor hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and specialty gases, raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources. Linde has contracts or commitments for, or readily available sources of, most of these raw materials; however, their long-term availability and prices are subject to market conditions.\nCompetition – Linde participates in highly competitive markets in industrial gases and engineering, which are characterized by a mixture of local, regional and global players, all of which exert competitive pressure on the parties. In locations where Linde has pipeline networks, which enable the company to provide reliable and economic supply of products to larger customers, Linde derives a competitive advantage.\nCompetitors in the industrial gases industry include global and regional companies such as L’Air Liquide S.A., Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Messer Group GmbH, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation (through Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation) as well as an extensive number of small to medium size independent industrial gas companies which compete locally as producers or distributors. In addition, a significant portion of the international gases market relates to customer-owned plants.\nEmployees – The company sources talent from an ever-changing and competitive environment. The ability to source and retain qualified and committed employees is a prerequisite for the company’s success, and represents a general risk for Linde.\nThe Board of Directors (\"Board\") has established a strategic business objective to maintain world-class standards in talent management. Executive variable compensation is assessed annually based on performance in financial measures as well as in several strategic non-financial areas, including talent management. The Human Capital Committee assists the Board in its oversight of Linde’s compensation policies and programs, particularly in regard to reviewing executive compensation for Linde’s executive officers. The Human Capital Committee also annually reviews the company’s management development and succession programs, diversity policies and objectives, and the associated programs to achieve those objectives. The global head of Human Resources reports to the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"). \nLinde has aligned inclusion as a core value with its business strategies and implemented inclusive workforce development planning into business process and performance management. Advancing inclusivity is a line management responsibility and Linde seeks competitive advantage through proactive management of its talent pipeline and recruiting processes. Linde provides equal employment opportunity, and recruits, hires, promotes and compensates people based solely on their performance and ability.\nEmployees receive a competitive salary and variable compensation components based on performance and job level. Linde has collective bargaining agreements with unions at numerous locations throughout the world. Additional benefits are offered such as occupational pensions and contributions towards health insurance or medical screening, reflecting regional conditions and local competition. Senior managers participate directly in the company’s growth in value through the Long Term Incentive Plan of Linde plc. In addition, annually managers have the ability to grant leadership equity awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to certain eligible employees. Linde also invests in professional development of its employees through formal and on-the-job training.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Linde had 65,289 employees worldwide comprised of approximately 28 percent women and 72 percent men. The total professional workforce is comprised of approximately 29 percent women and 71 percent men.\nEnvironment – Information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the section captioned “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Environmental Matters” in Item 7 of this 10-K.\nAvailable Information – The company makes its periodic and current reports available, free of charge, on or through its website, www.linde.com, as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nDue to the size and geographic reach of the company’s operations, a wide range of factors, many of which are outside of the company’s control, could materially affect the company’s future operations and financial performance. Management believes the following risks may significantly impact the company:\nWeakening economic conditions in markets in which Linde does business may adversely impact its financial results and/or cash flows.\nLinde serves a diverse group of industries across more than 80 countries, which generally leads to financial stability through various business cycles. However, a broad decline in general economic or business conditions in the industries served by its customers could adversely affect the demand for Linde’s products and impair the ability of its customers to satisfy their obligations to Linde, resulting in uncollected receivables and/or unanticipated contract terminations or project delays. For example, global political and economic uncertainty could reduce investment activities of Linde’s customers, which could adversely affect Linde’s business. \nIn addition, many of Linde’s customers are in businesses that are cyclical in nature, such as the chemicals, metals and energy industries. Downturns in these industries may adversely impact Linde during these cycles. Additionally, such conditions could impact the utilization of Linde’s manufacturing capacity which may require it to recognize impairment losses on tangible assets such as property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets such as goodwill, customer relationships or intellectual property. \nIncreases in the cost of energy and raw materials and/or disruption in the supply of these materials could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.\nEnergy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gases. Most of Linde’s energy requirements are in the form of electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution. Linde attempts to minimize the financial impact of variability in these costs through the management of customer contracts and reducing demand through operational productivity and energy efficiency. Large customer contracts typically have escalation and pass-through clauses to recover energy and feedstock costs. Such attempts may not successfully mitigate cost variability, which could negatively impact Linde’s financial condition or results of operations. The supply of energy has not been a significant issue in the geographic areas where Linde conducts business. However, regional energy conditions are unpredictable and may pose future risk.\nFor hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and specialty gases, raw materials are largely purchased from outside sources. Where feasible, Linde sources several of these raw materials, including hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and calcium carbide, as chemical or industrial byproducts. In addition, Linde has contracts or commitments for, or readily available sources of, most of these raw materials; however, their long-term availability and prices are subject to market conditions. A disruption in supply of such raw materials could impact Linde’s ability to meet contractual supply commitments.\nLinde’s international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad and international events and circumstances may adversely impact its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLinde has substantial international operations which are subject to risks including devaluations in currency exchange rates, transportation delays and interruptions, political and economic instability and disruptions, restrictions on the transfer of funds, trade conflicts and the imposition of duties and tariffs, import and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest, possible nationalization and/or expropriation of assets, changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax policies and compliance with governmental regulations. These events could have an adverse effect on the international operations of Linde in the future by reducing the demand for its products, decreasing the prices at which it can sell its products, reducing the revenue from international operations or otherwise having an adverse effect on its business. \nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect Linde's results.\nBecause a significant portion of Linde's revenue is denominated in currencies other than its reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in revenue, costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of assets and liabilities and related equity. Although the company from time to time utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures, its efforts to minimize currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business conditions. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect Linde’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nMacroeconomic factors may impact Linde’s ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of obtaining financing which may adversely impact Linde’s financial results and/or cash flows.\nVolatility and disruption in the U.S., European and global credit and equity markets, from time to time, could make it more difficult for Linde to obtain financing for its operations and/or could increase the cost of obtaining financing. In addition, Linde’s borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on its performance as measured by certain criteria such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these debt ratings could increase the cost of borrowing or make it more difficult to obtain financing. \nAn impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the company's financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the net carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $26 billion and $2 billion, respectively, primarily as a result of the business combination and the related acquisition method of accounting applied to the 2018 merger between Linde plc's predecessor companies. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the company periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinite-lived assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on Linde's results of operations in the periods recognized. \nCatastrophic events could disrupt the operations of Linde and/or its customers and suppliers and may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events or natural disasters such as extreme weather, including hurricanes and floods; health epidemics; pandemics, such as COVID-19; and acts of war or terrorism, could disrupt or delay Linde’s ability to produce and distribute its products to customers and could potentially expose Linde to third-party liability claims. In addition, such events could impact Linde’s customers and suppliers resulting in temporary or long-term outages and/or the limitation of supply of energy and other raw materials used in normal business operations. Linde evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, consults with vendors, insurance providers and industry experts, makes investments in suitably resilient design and technology, and conducts regular reviews of the business risks with management. Despite these steps, however, these situations are outside Linde’s control and may have a significant adverse impact on its financial results.\nThe inability to attract and retain qualified personnel may adversely impact Linde’s business.\nIf Linde fails to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, it may not be able to develop, market or sell its products or successfully manage its business. Linde is dependent upon a highly skilled, experienced and efficient workforce to be successful. Much of Linde’s competitive advantage is based on the expertise and experience of key personnel regarding marketing, technology, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure, systems and products. The inability to attract and hire qualified individuals or the loss of key employees in very skilled areas could have a negative effect on Linde’s financial results.\nIf Linde fails to keep pace with technological advances in the industry or if new technology initiatives do not become commercially accepted, customers may not continue to buy Linde’s products and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLinde’s research and development is directed toward developing new and improved methods for the production and distribution of industrial gases, the design and construction of plants and toward developing new markets and applications for the use of industrial and process gases. This results in the introduction of new applications and the development of new advanced process technologies. As a result of these efforts, Linde develops new and proprietary technologies and employs necessary measures to protect such technologies within the global geographies in which Linde operates. These technologies help Linde to create a competitive advantage and to provide a platform to grow its business. If Linde’s research and \ndevelopment activities do not keep pace with competitors or if Linde does not create new technologies that benefit customers, future results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks related to pension benefit plans may adversely impact Linde’s results of operations and cash flows.\nPension benefits represent significant financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements. Because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments and asset returns, significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to Linde’s plans. Linde utilizes the services of independent actuaries, whose models are used to facilitate these calculations. Several key assumptions are used in the actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, significant changes in actual investment returns on pension assets, discount rates, or legislative or regulatory changes could impact future results of operations and required pension contributions.\nOperational risks may adversely impact Linde’s business or results of operations.\nLinde’s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer contract requirements and other needs. Insufficient or excess capacity threatens Linde’s ability to generate competitive profit margins and may expose Linde to liabilities related to contract commitments. Operating results are also dependent on Linde’s ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget and in accordance with performance requirements. Failure to do so may expose Linde’s business to loss of revenue, potential litigation and loss of business reputation.\nAlso inherent in the management of Linde’s production facilities and delivery systems, including storage, vehicle transportation and pipelines, are operational risks that require continuous training, oversight and control. Material operating failures at production, storage facilities or pipelines, including fire, toxic release and explosions, or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accidents could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, loss of production and/or extensive property damage, all of which may negatively impact Linde’s financial results.\nLinde may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nLinde relies on information technology systems and networks for business and operational activities, and also stores and processes sensitive business and proprietary information in these systems and networks. These systems are susceptible to outages due to fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, viruses, break-ins and similar events, or breaches of security.\nLinde has taken steps to address these risks and concerns by implementing advanced security technologies, internal controls, network and data center resiliency and recovery processes. Despite these steps, however, our information technology systems have in the past been and in the future will likely be subject to increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks. Operational failures and breaches of security from such attempts could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to Linde or our employees and customers or suppliers. These failures and breaches could result in business interruption or malfunction and lead to legal or regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on Linde’s operations, reputation and financial results. To date, such attempts have not had any significant impact on Linde's operations or financial results.\nThe inability to effectively integrate acquisitions or collaborate with joint venture partners could adversely impact Linde’s financial position and results of operations.\nLinde has evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate, a wide array of potential strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. Many of these transactions, if consummated, could be material to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired company, business or group of assets may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Although historically Linde has been successful with its acquisition strategy and execution, the areas where Linde may face risks include:\n•the need to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n•diversion of management time and focus from operating existing business to acquisition integration challenges;\n•cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into the existing organization;\n•the need to integrate each company’s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems to permit effective management;\n•difficulty with the assimilation of acquired operations and products;\n•failure to achieve targeted synergies and cost reductions; and\n•inability to retain key employees and business relationships of acquired companies.\nForeign acquisitions and joint ventures involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned herein, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nAlso, the anticipated benefit of potential future acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or impairments of goodwill, any of which could adversely impact Linde’s financial results.\nLinde is subject to a variety of international laws and government regulations and changes in, or failure to comply with, these laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the company’s business, financial position and results of operations.\nLinde is subject to regulations in the following areas, among others:\n•environmental protection, including climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies;\n•U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and currency controls;\n•safety;\n•securities laws applicable in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions;\n•trade and import/export restrictions, as well as economic sanctions laws;\n•antitrust matters;\n•data protection;\n•global anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and\n•healthcare regulations.\nChanges in these or other regulatory areas may impact Linde’s profitability and may give rise to new or increased compliance risks: it may become more complex and costly to ensure compliance, and the level of sanctions in the event of non-compliance may rise. Noncompliance with such laws and regulations could result in penalties or sanctions, cancellation of marketing rights or restrictions on participation in, or even exclusion from, public tender proceedings, all of which could have a material adverse impact on Linde’s financial results and/or reputation. \nSuch changes may also restrict Linde’s ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. Changes to regulations in the areas of environmental protection and climate change, for example, may impact customer and competitor behavior driving structural changes in key end markets. While Linde will work to mitigate these risks through the pursuit of strategic alliances and investment in applications technologies to capture new growth areas, given the uncertainty about the type and scope of new regulations, it is difficult to predict how such changes and their impact on market behavior will ultimately impact Linde’s business. However, such changes could have a material adverse impact on Linde's results of operations. \nDoing business globally requires Linde to comply with anti-corruption, trade, compliance and economic sanctions and similar laws, and to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure that its employees and other intermediaries comply with the applicable restrictions. These restrictions include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products, services and any other economic resources to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. Compliance with these restrictions requires, among other things, screening of business partners. Despite its commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics, the company cannot ensure that its policies and procedures will always protect it from intentional, reckless or negligent acts committed by employees or agents under the applicable laws. If Linde fails to comply with laws governing the conduct of international operations, Linde may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially adversely affect its reputation, business and results of operations.\nThe outcome of litigation or governmental investigations may adversely impact the company’s business or results of operations.\nLinde’s subsidiaries are party to various lawsuits and governmental investigations arising in the ordinary course of business. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect Linde’s ability to conduct business. Linde and its subsidiaries may in the future become subject to further claims and litigation, which is impossible to predict. The litigation and other claims Linde faces are subject to inherent uncertainties. Legal or regulatory judgments or agreed settlements might give rise to expenses which are not covered, or are not fully covered, by insurance benefits and may also lead to negative publicity and reputational damage. An unfavorable outcome or determination could cause a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations.\nPotential product defects or inadequate customer care may adversely impact Linde’s business or results of operations.\nRisks associated with products and services may result in potential liability claims, the loss of customers or damage to Linde’s reputation. Principal possible causes of risks associated with products and services are product defects or an inadequate level of customer care when Linde is providing services.\nLinde is exposed to legal risks relating to product liability in the countries where it operates, including countries such as the United States, where legal risks (in particular through class actions) have historically been more significant than in other countries. The outcome of any pending or future products and services proceedings or investigations cannot be predicted and legal or regulatory judgments or agreed settlements may give rise to significant losses, costs and expenses.\nThe manufacturing and sale of products as well as the construction and sale of plants by Linde may give rise to risks associated with the production, filling, storage, handling and transport of raw materials, goods or waste. Industrial gases are potentially hazardous substances and medical gases and the related healthcare services must comply with the relevant specifications in order to not adversely affect the health of patients treated with them.\nLinde’s products and services, if defective or not handled or performed appropriately, may lead to personal injuries, business interruptions, environmental damages or other significant damages, which may result, among other consequences, in liability, losses, monetary penalties or compensation payments, environmental clean-up costs or other costs and expenses, exclusion from certain market sectors deemed important for future development of the business and loss of reputation. All these consequences could have a material adverse effect on Linde’s business and results of operations.\nU.S. civil liabilities may not be enforceable against Linde.\nLinde is organized under the laws of Ireland and substantial portions of its assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, certain directors and officers of Linde and its subsidiaries reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon Linde or such persons, or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States, rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws.\nA judgment for the payment of money rendered by a court in the United States based on civil liability would not be automatically enforceable in Ireland. There is no treaty between Ireland and the United States providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgments. The following requirements must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in Ireland (i) the judgment must be for a definite sum, (ii) the judgment must be final and conclusive; and (iii) the judgment must be provided by a court of competent jurisdiction.\nAn Irish court will also exercise its right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment (i) was obtained by fraud; (ii) violated Irish public policy; (iii) is in breach of natural justice; or (iv) if the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment.\nIn addition, there is doubt as to whether an Irish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability on Linde or such persons in an original action predicated solely upon the U.S. federal securities laws brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Ireland against Linde or such member, officer or expert, respectively.\nChanges in tax laws or policy could adversely impact the company’s financial position or results of operations.\nLinde and its subsidiaries are subject to the tax rules and regulations in the U.S., Germany, Ireland, the U.K. and other countries in which they operate. Those tax rules and regulations are subject to change on a prospective or retroactive basis. Under current economic and political conditions tax rates and policies in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., the U.K. and the EU, are subject to significant changes which could result in a significant change to Linde's current and deferred income tax. In particular, since Linde is currently treated as U.K. tax resident, any potential changes in the tax rules applying to U.K. tax-resident companies would directly affect Linde.\nA change in Linde’s tax residency could have a negative effect on the company’s future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges. If Linde ceases to be resident in the U.K. and becomes resident in another jurisdiction, it may be subject to U.K. exit charges, and/or could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction. If Linde were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction, it could be subject to duplicative taxation. Furthermore, although Linde is incorporated in Ireland and is not expected to be treated as a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is possible that the IRS could challenge this result or that changes in U.S. federal income tax law could alter this result.  If the IRS successfully asserted such a position or the law were to change, significant adverse tax consequences may result for Linde, the company and Linde’s shareholders. \nChanges in tax laws may result in higher tax expense and tax payments. In addition, changes in tax legislation and uncertainty about the tax environment in some regions may restrict Linde's opportunity to enforce its respective rights under the law. Linde also operates in countries with complex tax regulations which could be interpreted in different ways. Linde and its subsidiaries are subject to audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions or other review actions by the relevant financial or tax authorities. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in Linde’s or its subsidiaries’ financial statements and may materially affect their respective financial results for the period when such determination is made.",
