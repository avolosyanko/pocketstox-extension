      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS\nAbbott Laboratories is an Illinois corporation, incorporated in 1900. Abbott’s* principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of healthcare products.\nNARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nAbbott has four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.\nEstablished Pharmaceutical Products\nThese products include a broad line of branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured worldwide and marketed and sold outside the United States in emerging markets. These products are generally sold directly to wholesalers, distributors, government agencies, healthcare facilities, pharmacies, and independent retailers from Abbott-owned distribution centers or public warehouses, depending on the market served. Certain products are co-marketed or co-promoted with, or licensed from, other companies.\nThe principal products included in the broad therapeutic area portfolios of the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment are:\n•gastroenterology products, including Creon™, for the treatment of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency associated with several underlying conditions, including cystic fibrosis and chronic pancreatitis; Duspatal™ and Dicetel™, for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome or biliary spasm; Heptral™, Transmetil™, and Samyr™, for the treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis (associated with liver disease) or depressive symptoms; and Duphalac™, for regulation of the physiological rhythm of the colon;\n•women’s health products, including Duphaston™, for the treatment of many different gynecological disorders; and Femoston™, a hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women;\n•cardiovascular and metabolic products, including Lipanthyl™ and TriCor™, for the treatment of dyslipidemia; Omacor™, for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia; Physiotens™, for the treatment of hypertension; and Synthroid™, for the treatment of hypothyroidism;\n•pain and central nervous system products, including Serc™, for the treatment of Ménière’s disease and vestibular vertigo; Brufen™, for the treatment of pain, fever, and inflammation; and Sevedol™, for the treatment of severe migraines; \n•respiratory drugs and vaccines, including the anti-infective clarithromycin (sold under the trademarks Klacid™, Claribid™, and Klaricid™); and Influvac™, an influenza vaccine; and\n•biosimilar products, including the areas of oncology and women's health.\nThe Established Pharmaceutical Products segment directs its primary marketing efforts toward building strong brands with key stakeholders, including consumers, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare providers. Government agencies are also important customers.\nCompetition in the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment is generally from other healthcare and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the substitution of generic drugs for the brand prescribed and introduction of additional forms of already marketed established products by generic or branded competitors may increase competitive pressures.\n________________________________________________________\n*As used throughout the text of this report on Form 10-K, the term “Abbott” refers to Abbott Laboratories, an Illinois corporation, or Abbott Laboratories and its consolidated subsidiaries, as the context requires.\nDiagnostic Products\nThese products include a broad line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, clinics, physicians’ offices, retailers, government agencies, alternate care testing sites, and plasma protein therapeutic companies from Abbott-owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors.\nThe principal products included in the Diagnostic Products segment are:\n•core laboratory and transfusion medicine systems in the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and transfusion serology testing, including the Alinity® family of instruments along with the ARCHITECT® and Cell-Dyn® systems. These systems are used for screening and/or diagnosis for cancer, cardiac and metabolic disorders, drugs of abuse, thyroid function, fertility, neurologic and general chemistries, infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV, therapeutic drug monitoring, and a suite of SARS-CoV-2 serology assays;\n•molecular diagnostics polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instrument systems, including Alinity® m and m2000™ that automate the extraction, purification, and preparation of DNA and RNA from patient samples, and detect and measure infectious agents including HIV, hepatitis, HPV, sexually transmitted infections, SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A & B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); and products for oncology with the Vysis® FISH product line of genomic-based tests;\n•point-of-care systems, including the i-STAT® and i-STAT® Alinity® and cartridges for testing blood gas, chemistry, electrolytes, coagulation and immunoassay;\n•rapid diagnostics lateral flow testing products in the area of infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2, including the BinaxNOW® and Panbio® rapid testing platforms, influenza, HIV, hepatitis, and tropical diseases such as malaria and dengue fever; molecular point-of-care testing for HIV, including the m-PIMA® HIV-1/2 Viral Load Test, and for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A & B, RSV and strep A, including the ID NOW® rapid molecular system; cardiometabolic testing, including Afinion® and Cholestech LDX® platforms and tests; and a toxicology business for drug and alcohol testing; and\n•informatics and automation solutions for use in laboratories, including laboratory automation systems such as the GLP systems Track™, the RALS® point-of-care solution, and AlinIQ®, a suite of informatics tools and professional services.\nThe Diagnostic Products segment’s products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products.\nNutritional Products\nThese products include a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products manufactured, marketed, and sold worldwide. These products are generally marketed and sold directly to consumers and to institutions, wholesalers, retailers, healthcare facilities, government agencies, and third-party distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers or third-party distributors.\nThe principal products included in the Nutritional Products segment are:\n•various forms of infant formula and follow-on formula, including Similac®, Similac® 360 Total Care®, Similac Pro-Advance®, Similac® Advance®, Similac 360 Total Care® Sensitive, Similac Sensitive®, Go & Grow by Similac®, Similac® NeoSure®, Similac® Organic, Similac® Special Care®, Similac Total Comfort®, Similac® Soy Isomil®, Similac® Alimentum®, EleCare®, Gain™, and Grow™;\n•adult and other pediatric nutritional products, including Ensure®, Ensure Plus®, Ensure® Enlive®, Ensure® NutriVigor™, Ensure® Max Protein, Ensure® High Protein, Glucerna®, Glucerna Hunger Smart®, ProSure™, PediaSure®, PediaSure SideKicks®, PediaSure® Peptide, Juven®, Abound™, and Pedialyte®; and\n•nutritional products used in enteral feeding in healthcare institutions, including Jevity®, Glucerna® 1.2 Cal, Glucerna® 1.5 Cal, Osmolite®, Oxepa®, Freego™ (Enteral Pump) and Freego™ sets, Nepro®, and Vital®.\nPrimary marketing efforts for nutritional products are directed toward consumers or physicians or other healthcare professionals. In addition, nutritional products are also promoted directly to the public by consumer marketing efforts in markets where permitted.\nCompetition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and healthcare manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers’ products may increase competitive pressure.\nMedical Devices\nThese products include a broad line of rhythm management, electrophysiology, heart failure, vascular and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care and continuous glucose monitoring products, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally marketed and sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians’ offices, consumers, and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.\nThe principal products included in the Medical Devices segment are:\n•rhythm management products, including Assurity MRI® and Endurity MRI® pacemaker systems, and Aveir® single-chamber (VR and AR) and Aveir® dual chamber (DR) leadless pacemaker systems; Ellipse®, Fortify Assura®, and Gallant® implantable cardioverter defibrillators and Gallant and Quadra Assura MP® implantable cardioverter defibrillator with cardiac resynchronization therapy and MultiPoint™ Pacing technology; and Confirm Rx®, Jot Dx® and ASSERT-IQ® implantable cardiac monitors;\n•electrophysiology products, including the TactiFlex® and TactiCath® families of ablation catheters, and FlexAbility® irrigated ablation catheters; EnSite® family of cardiac mapping systems; Agilis® NxT and Swartz™ introducer catheters; the Advisor® HD Grid mapping catheter; and ViewFlex® family of intracardiac echocardiography catheters;\n•heart failure related products, including the HeartMate® left ventricular assist device family; the CardioMEMS® HF System pulmonary artery sensor, a heart failure monitoring system; the CentriMag® System, an acute mechanical circulatory support system; and patient self-testing products and services;\n•vascular products, including the XIENCE® family of drug-eluting coronary stent systems developed on the Multi-Link Vision® platform; StarClose SE®, Perclose ProGlide® and Perclose ProStyle® vessel closure devices, TREK® coronary balloon dilatation products, Hi-Torque Balance Middleweight Universal II® guidewires, Supera® Peripheral Stent System, a peripheral vascular stent system; Acculink®/Accunet® and Xact®/Emboshield NAV6®, carotid stent systems; the OPTIS® integrated systems with Ultreon® 1.0 and 2.0 Software, compatible with the Dragonfly OPTIS® and OpStar® imaging catheters and PressureWire® fractional flow reserve measurement systems; Diamondback 360® coronary and peripheral orbital atherectomy systems; and Esprit™ BTK everolimus eluting resorbable scaffold system;\n•structural heart products, including MitraClip®, a mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system; TriClip®, a tricuspid valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system; Epic®, a surgical family of aortic valve and mitral valve replacement devices; Portico® and Navitor® transcatheter aortic heart valves; Regent™ and Masters Series® mechanical heart valves; Amplatzer® PFO occluders; Amplatzer Amulet® occluder devices; and the Tendyne® transcatheter mitral valve replacement system; \n•continuous glucose and blood glucose monitoring systems under the FreeStyle® brand such as the FreeStyle Libre® system, including sensors, data management decision software, test strips, and accessories for people with diabetes; and the Lingo® continuous glucose monitoring system, including sensors and data management decision software for people’s health and wellness; and\n•neuromodulation products, including spinal cord stimulators Proclaim® Plus and Proclaim® XR recharge-free implantable pulse generators (IPG) and rechargeable Eterna® IPG, each with BurstDR® stimulation, and Proclaim® DRG IPG, a neurostimulation device designed for dorsal root ganglion therapy, for the treatment of chronic pain disorders; and the non-rechargeable Infinity™ deep brain stimulation (DBS) system and the rechargeable Liberta RC™ DBS system, each with directional lead technology for the treatment of movement disorders.\nThese products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited from technological advantages of certain of its current products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated as competitors introduce new products.\nINFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ABBOTT’S BUSINESS IN GENERAL\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nAbbott purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to Abbott’s operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and around the world. There have been no recent significant availability problems or supply shortages for raw materials or supplies. \nPatents, Trademarks, and Licenses\nAbbott is aware of the desirability for patent and trademark protection for its products. Accordingly, where possible, patents and trademarks are sought and obtained for Abbott’s products in the United States and countries of interest to Abbott. Abbott owns or has licenses under a substantial number of patents and patent applications. Principal trademarks and the products they cover are discussed in the Narrative Description of Business on pages 1 through 4. These, and various patents that expire during the period from 2025 to 2045, in the aggregate, are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Abbott’s business. Abbott believes that no single patent, license, or trademark is material in relation to Abbott’s business as a whole.\nSeasonal Aspects, Customers, and Renegotiation\nThere are no significant seasonal aspects to Abbott’s business. Abbott has no single customer that, if the customer was lost, would have a material adverse effect on Abbott. No material portion of Abbott’s business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of a government.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAbbott believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection. Regulations under federal, state, and various other countries’ environmental laws impose stringent limitations on emissions and discharges to the environment from various manufacturing operations. Abbott’s capital and operating expenditures for pollution control in 2024 were not material and are not expected to be material in 2025.\nAbbott has been identified as one of many potentially responsible parties in investigations and/or remediations at several locations in the United States, including Puerto Rico, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. Abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other sites, some of which are owned by Abbott, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency or similar agencies. While it is not feasible to predict with certainty the final costs related to those investigations and remediation activities, Abbott believes that such costs, together with other expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.\nHuman Capital\nThe sustainability of Abbott’s business depends on attracting, engaging and developing talented people with diverse backgrounds who share Abbott’s mission to help people live their healthiest possible lives. Abbott provides its employees opportunities to grow and develop their careers, market competitive compensation and benefit programs, and the satisfaction of being part of a global company dedicated to improving health in more than 160 countries.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Abbott employed approximately 114,000 people, 69% of whom were employed outside of the U.S. Women represented 47% of Abbott’s U.S. workforce, 46% of its global workforce, and 43% of its managers.\nTalent Management\nAbbott has an integrated global talent management process that is designed to identify and assess talent across the organization and provide equal and consistent opportunities for employees to develop their skills. All levels of employees participate in Abbott’s annual performance management process to create development plans that support their particular career objectives, and Abbott provides a broad range of training, mentoring and other development opportunities to help its employees meet these objectives. The board of directors conducts an annual Talent Management Review, focusing on development of talent, diversity, and succession planning for critical positions. Similar reviews take place across Abbott to develop talent and diversity across the organization. \nDiversity and Inclusion \nAbbott is committed to fostering a workplace that is inclusive for all. Abbott ties executive compensation to human capital management to sustain an inclusive culture and the fair and balanced treatment of Abbott’s employees. Abbott's diversity, equity, and inclusion report provides an update on the plans, strategies, and actions undertaken to ensure that Abbott continues to attract, retain, and develop the best talent from the more than 160 countries in which it does business. \nAbbott’s employee networks play an important role in building an inclusive culture across all Abbott operations. A corporate officer serves as a sponsor for each of these networks, helping to align their objectives with Abbott’s business strategies. Abbott has nine such networks, which are: Asian Leadership and Cultural Network, Black Business Network, disABILITY Network (supporting employees with disabilities), Early Career Network (supporting early career employees), LA VOICE Network (supporting Hispanic and Latino employees), PRIDE (supporting LGBTQ employees), Veterans Network, Women Leaders of Abbott, and Women in STEM. All networks are open to all Abbott employees.\nAbbott offers professional development programs, which provide recent college graduates the opportunity to rotate through different areas of Abbott, often with the chance to work outside their home country. Also, Abbott hosts hundreds of college students for paid internships. Further, Abbott has offered a STEM internship program for high school students in the U.S. since 2012 and since 2021, students who complete the program receive a college credit recommendation from the American Council on Education. The program’s objective is to increase the number of students pursuing STEM-related careers and contribute to a more diverse talent pipeline for Abbott. \nHealth and Safety\nThe health, safety and wellness of its employees is an Abbott priority embedded at every level of its business. Abbott’s integrated Environmental, Health and Safety organization governs health, safety and wellness at Abbott’s facilities. Abbott also maintains global policies and standards for managing employee health and safety.\nAbbott takes a holistic approach to employee well-being. Abbott’s global wellness programs are designed to meet the unique needs of employees across businesses and geographies and offer a wide range of programs, including supporting the emotional, physical, and financial health of employees and their families. For example, for over 20 years, Abbott has annually offered Exercise Across Abbott, which is a four-week physical wellness program that encourages employees to team up with colleagues and track how many minutes they exercise each day. Over 40,000 Abbott employees across 75 countries took part in 2024.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAbbott is committed to building, retaining, and motivating a diverse talent pipeline that can meet the current and future needs of its businesses. To that end, Abbott provides market competitive compensation, healthcare benefits, continuing education benefits, pension and/or retirement savings plans, financial support for employees with student loan debt, and several programs to facilitate employees building an ownership stake in Abbott, including a global long-term incentive program for employees generally beginning at the manager level. Abbott also has procedures and processes focused on ensuring employees receive equitable compensation, regardless of race or gender or other personal characteristics.\nRegulation\nThe development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion, and distribution of Abbott’s products are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar national and international regulatory agencies. Government regulation by various international, supranational, federal and state agencies addresses (among other matters) the development and approval to market Abbott’s products, as well as the inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, postmarket changes to products, labeling, packaging, supply chains, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage, and disposal practices. In addition, Abbott’s laboratories and associated testing services are subject to comprehensive government regulation, including registration, certification, and licensure, by federal, state, and local agencies, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and their respective foreign counterparts. Certain of these agencies require Abbott's laboratories to meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards and undergo inspections.\nAbbott’s international operations are also affected by trade and investment regulations in many countries. These may require local investment, restrict Abbott’s investments, or limit the import of raw materials and finished products.\nAbbott’s laboratory facilities, home monitoring services, and durable medical equipment suppliers, which provide services, related products and medical devices to consumers, are subject to additional laws and regulations applicable to healthcare providers and suppliers that submit claims for reimbursement or payment to third-party payors, including government agencies such as Medicare and Medicaid, or governments. In the United States, these entities may from time to time conduct inquiries, claims audits, investigations, and enforcement actions relating to the claims or enrollment criteria.\nAbbott is subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback, anti-self-referral, and false claims laws in the United States. Prescription drug, nutrition, and medical device manufacturers such as Abbott are also subject to taxes, as well as application, product, user, establishment, and other fees. Governmental agencies can also invalidate intellectual property rights.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Abbott’s business. Among other effects, healthcare regulations and significant changes thereto (such as the introduction of the Medical Devices Regulation and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation in the European Union) substantially increase the time, difficulty, and costs incurred in developing, obtaining and maintaining approval to market, and marketing newly developed and existing products. Abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, suspension or revocation of billing privileges, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. Similarly, compliance with the laws and regulations governing laboratories and testing services requires specialized expertise. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements can result in sanctions, including suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory’s certification, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines or criminal penalties.\nAbbott’s business can also be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of healthcare products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use.\nAccess to human healthcare products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in many countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce health care costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by healthcare payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. Abbott expects that insurers and providers will continue attempts to reduce the cost or utilization of healthcare products. Many countries control the price of healthcare products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, or coverage limitations. Budgetary pressures on healthcare payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on Abbott’s products for the foreseeable future. In the United States, the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical devices, diagnostics, supplies, and other products, as well as the procedures in which these products may be used. The government follows a diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system for certain institutional services provided under Medicare or Medicaid and has implemented a prospective payment system (PPS) for services delivered in hospital outpatient, nursing home, and home health settings. DRG and PPS entitle a healthcare facility to a fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatment, thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditures for many healthcare products. Other payment methodology changes have been proposed and implemented from time to time. For example, Medicare implemented a competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment (including diabetes products), enteral nutrition products, and supplies. \nGovernmental cost containment efforts also affect Abbott’s nutritional products business. In the United States, for example, under regulations governing the federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), all states must have a cost containment program for infant formula. As a result, through competitive bidding states obtain rebates from manufacturers of infant formula whose products are used in the program.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act) includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted at the state level domestically, and an increasing number of governments worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties.\nPolicy changes or implementation of new healthcare legislation could result in significant changes to healthcare systems. In the United States, this could include potential modification, including expansion or repeal of all or parts of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe regulation of data privacy and security, and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information (including patient health information, financial information and other sensitive personal information), is increasing. For example, the European Union, China, various other countries, and various U.S. states have enacted or are considering enacting data protection laws that contain significant compliance obligations and financial penalties for noncompliance. In addition, regulators with general consumer protection authority, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and U.S. states Attorneys General, are focused on how consumer data is used by entities in the healthcare industry. Further, there are regulations of data privacy and security that are specific to healthcare companies. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued rules governing the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information, and the FDA has issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical devices. In addition, certain countries have issued or are considering “data localization” laws, which limit companies’ ability to transfer protected data across country borders. Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations can result in business disruption and enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties. Transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging as laws and regulations are enacted or amended, and Abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area. \nAbbott expects debate to continue at all government levels worldwide over the manufacture, quality assurance requirements, marketing authorization processes, post-market surveillance requirements, availability, method of delivery, and payment for healthcare products and services, as well as data privacy and security. Abbott believes that future legislation and regulation in the markets it serves could affect the timing and expense associated with bringing healthcare products or services to market, access to healthcare products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or reimbursements or the rate of price increases for healthcare products and services, change healthcare delivery systems, create new fees and obligations for the pharmaceutical, nutrition, diagnostic, and medical device industries, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the healthcare industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above.\nINTERNET INFORMATION\nCopies of Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available, free of charge, through Abbott’s investor relations website (www.abbottinvestor.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after Abbott electronically files the material with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission).

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS        \nIn addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results. Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nDisruptions to Abbott’s global supply chain, which is large and complex, could negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.\nAbbott’s operations and performance depend on its ability to manage its large and complex global supply chain. While Abbott has taken and will continue to take actions to mitigate the risks of disruptions to its global supply chain, disruptions to it could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions such as inflationary pressures and labor shortages contributed to global supply chain challenges in the early part of the decade, which adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. \nAbbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.\nFrom time to time, Abbott pursues acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or may dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-lived assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity.\nAbbott depends on sophisticated information systems and maintains protected personal data, and a significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption affecting these information systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products make them susceptible to a cybersecurity incident, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cybersecurity incidents. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product availability, functionality or safety, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.\nAbbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to numerous data privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally, including data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach or unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.\nAbbott invests in its information systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of a cybersecurity incident or other significant disruption, and monitors its information systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential cybersecurity threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future cybersecurity incidents or other significant disruptions to any of the information systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers or other partners with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant cybersecurity incident or disruption that impacts Abbott. Any significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption affecting Abbott’s information systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAbbott’s research and development efforts to develop commercially successful products and technologies and its efforts to develop and maintain new business and operating models necessary to support data-driven healthcare solutions may not succeed, either of which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline.\nTo remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.\nPromising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer.\nIn addition, Abbott is developing new business and operating models necessary to support the creation of data-driven healthcare solutions such as data-centric prevention and treatment strategies, new products and technologies that incorporate data insights, and product technology strategies that focus on connectivity and data creation management. Even if Abbott successfully develops such new data-driven healthcare solutions, they may be rendered obsolete by competitors' innovations, the nature of the data and insights generated, or changing customer preferences. Failure to develop and maintain business and operating models necessary to support data-driven healthcare solutions may negatively impact the demand for Abbott products and technologies, causing Abbott's revenues and profitability to decline. \nThe manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers or manufacturers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer.\nThe manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or the global supply chain, failure to meet product specifications, cybersecurity incidents, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, time and expense spent investigating the cause and remediating the problem, if any, a production stoppage at a manufacturing facility, and depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers or manufacturers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.\nAbbott has indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $14.1 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business \nand economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.\nFurther, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.\nAdditionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIt is costly for Abbott to comply with numerous governmental regulations and to develop compliant products and processes, and consequences for non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\nAbbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval, clearance, or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, postmarket changes to products, advertising, and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, consent decrees, seizures of Abbott’s products, and civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution.\nThese actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy any actual or potential issues; the inability to obtain future product approvals, clearances, or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For example, in February 2022, Abbott initiated a voluntary recall of certain powder infant formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan at which time it temporarily stopped manufacturing at the facility. In May 2022, Abbott entered into a consent decree with the FDA. For information on the impact of Abbott's voluntary recall and manufacturing stoppage, see the discussion in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report. \nLaws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\nAbbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such \nviolations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition.\nChanges in the healthcare regulatory environment may adversely impact the demand for and price of Abbott’s products.\nBoth in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to healthcare, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them.\nFurther, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to healthcare products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for healthcare products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\nFor additional information concerning healthcare regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.”\nThe expiration or loss of intellectual property protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income.\nMany of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.”\nSignificant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition.\nHealthcare products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. When new safety concerns are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety concerns arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product have been and could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety concerns affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured and could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\nEconomic, Geopolitical and Industry Risks\nAbbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.\nIn the United States and other countries, Abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on certain product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “Regulation.” To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to healthcare or other factors, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced.\nCompetitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of patent litigation, such as competitor claims that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time \nconsuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.\nNew products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.\nAbbott’s products face intense competition from competitors' products and technological advances. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products. Further, the development of new technology, healthcare products and medicines, and the development of new treatments for disease could significantly change the competitive landscape of the healthcare industry and negatively impact the demand for certain Abbott products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products and technological advances.\nFluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect Abbott’s financial statements and its ability to realize projected sales and earnings.\nAlthough Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the U.S. in 2024 made up approximately 61 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.\nInformation on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this report. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this report.\nAdverse changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations, both in the U.S. and internationally, could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations.\nAbbott is a large, global corporation and is subject to complex and evolving tax rules, both in the U.S. and internationally. Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations, such as the two-pillared plan proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD), or adverse decisions regarding Abbott's tax positions could materially adversely affect Abbott’s effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations. A discussion on the OECD proposals and their potential impact on Abbott’s business in the future is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report. Abbott is unable to predict what changes to the tax laws of the U.S. or other jurisdictions may be proposed or enacted in the future or what impact such changes would have on its business. \nDeterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.\nUnfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables or inhibit Abbott's ability to best utilize its cash. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including healthcare. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental healthcare systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government healthcare systems.\nAbbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, which could have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations. \nAs a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, may negatively impact certain Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause, and during the COVID-19 pandemic caused, significant reductions in demand for certain products, increased difficulty in serving customers, disruptions to manufacturing and supply chains, and negative effects on certain of Abbott’s operations as well as the operations of its suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact, and during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted, the broader \neconomies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, inflation rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. \nFor information on the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on Abbott’s business, see the discussion in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.\nThe international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.\nAbbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2024 made up approximately 61 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott’s international operations include:\n•differing local product preferences and product requirements;\n•trade protection measures, including tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, other governmental restrictions such as trade sanctions, and changes to international trade agreements;\n•difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;\n•differing labor regulations;\n•potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n•geopolitical and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;\n•restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;\n•price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;\n•inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;\n•diminished protection of intellectual property; and\n•potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-competition, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nEvents contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.\nOther factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.\nMany other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including:\n•changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product approval standards, product labeling standards, manufacturing standards, source and use laws, and environmental laws;\n•differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree healthcare, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;\n•changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, labor, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott’s equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;\n•changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;\n•changes in business, economic, and geopolitical conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; global climate change, extreme weather and natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;\n•changes in Abbott’s business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, and changing product mix;\n•changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, wholesaler, or other customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and\n•legal challenges, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.\nMany of these factors may manifest individually or collectively, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which resulted in political instability, sanctions, economic and currency volatility, inflation and other operational and supply disruptions. To date, Abbott has been able to manage these disruptions without material impact to its results of operations. However, it is difficult to predict the future implications and consequences of the situation on local, regional or global economies and Abbott’s operations. There could be additional sanctions, economic volatility, cybersecurity threats, political instability, transportation and other supply disruptions, as well as collection default or liquidity risks or limited availability of resources to conduct essential business processes that could have a material adverse impact to Abbott’s operations and financial condition. The resolution and long-term impact of this matter are uncertain and difficult to predict.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, and projections.
