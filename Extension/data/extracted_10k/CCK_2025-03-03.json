      "text": "ITEM 1. Business\nCrown Holdings, Inc. (the \"Company\" or the \"Registrant\") (where the context requires, the \"Company\" shall include reference to the Company and its consolidated subsidiary companies) is a Pennsylvania corporation.\nThe Company was founded in 1892 and is a leading global diversified packaging business that manufactures metal cans and ends (aluminum and steel) for the beverage, food and aerosol industries and a wide range of transit packaging products and solutions from multiple substrates including steel, paper, and plastic. The Company's transit packaging products include automation and equipment technologies, protective packaging solutions and steel and plastic consumables which are sold into the metals, food and beverage, construction, agricultural, corrugated, and general industries. \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company operated 189 plants along with sales and service facilities throughout 39 countries and had approximately 23,000 employees. In 2024, consolidated net sales for the Company were $11.8 billion with 63% derived from operations outside the United States (\"U.S.\") \nApproximately 72% of the Company's consolidated net sales were derived from the Company's global beverage can business. Over the last several years, the Company has deployed capital to expand production capacity in its global beverage can operations to support growing customer demand in both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drink categories serving local, regional and global customers. The beverage can continues to disproportionately be the package of choice for new beverage product introductions. The Company continues to drive innovation by increasing its ability to offer multiple specialty can sizes, including slim and sleek cans, to help customers differentiate their products. It also continues to deliver new printing and decorating capabilities, as well as services that aid customers throughout the entire production cycle, from consultation and development to line implementation and quality assurance. \nThe Company is guided by commitments to its stakeholders and its own goals to foster a resilient business with longevity, which requires an emphasis on financial performance and sustainability. The Company’s Twentyby30TM program, which is a comprehensive sustainability strategy that outlines twenty measurable goals to be achieved by 2030, has accelerated critical initiatives and progress around carbon footprint management and efficient use of resources, among other issues.\nThe Company continues to leverage the inherent eco-friendly benefits of its primary product, metal packaging, to advance toward its targets. Both aluminum and steel cans are infinitely recyclable. Aluminum beverage cans remain the world’s most recycled beverage packaging, exemplify sustainability and are a strong contributor to the circular economy. The Company is working in conjunction with industry partners to drive higher recycling rates and increase recycled content to ensure infinitely recycled metal packaging is available for generations of future use. Additionally, Transit Packaging uses recycled materials in its paper, cardboard and strapping products. \nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nThe Company's business is generally organized by product line and geography. The reportable segments are: Americas Beverage, European Beverage, Asia Pacific and Transit Packaging. Operations are managed regionally to best serve our customers. \nAMERICAS BEVERAGE\nThe Americas Beverage segment manufactures infinitely recyclable aluminum beverage cans and ends, glass bottles, steel crowns and aluminum caps. Manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Colombia and Mexico. Americas Beverage had net sales in 2024 of $5.2 billion and segment income (as defined under Note Z to the consolidated financial statements) of $987 million.\nEUROPEAN BEVERAGE\nThe European Beverage segment manufactures infinitely recyclable aluminum beverage cans and ends in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. European Beverage had net sales in 2024 of $2.1 billion and segment income (as defined under Note Z to the consolidated financial statements) of $276 million.\nASIA PACIFIC\nThe Asia Pacific segment manufactures infinitely recyclable beverage cans and ends, food cans and specialty packaging in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe Asia Pacific segment had net sales in 2024 of $1.2 billion and segment income (as defined under Note Z to the consolidated financial statements) of $195 million.\nTRANSIT PACKAGING\nThe Company's Transit Packaging segment includes the Company’s worldwide automation and equipment technologies, protective packaging solutions and steel and plastic consumables. Automation and equipment technologies include manual, semi-automatic and automatic equipment and tools, which are primarily used in end-of-line operations to apply and remove consumables such as strap and film. Protective solutions include standard and purpose designed products, such as airbags, edge protectors, and honeycomb products, among others that help prevent movement of, and/or damage to, a wide range of industrial and consumer goods during transport. Steel and plastic consumables include steel strap, plastic strap, industrial film and other related products that are used across a wide range of industries. The automation and equipment business along with our product offering allow the Company to offer a comprehensive solution to pack, wrap, strap, secure and store products all over the world. \nThe Transit Packaging segment had net sales in 2024 of $2.1 billion and segment income (as defined under Note Z to the consolidated financial statements) of $270 million.\nOTHER\nThe Company's other segments (\"Other\") include the Company's food can, aerosol can and closures businesses in North America, and beverage tooling and equipment operations in the U.S. and the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"). The Company manufactures a variety of food and aerosol cans and ends and closures in assorted shapes and sizes. The Company’s customers include manufacturers of food, including pet food, personal care, household and industrial products.\nAdditional financial information concerning the Company’s reportable segments is set forth within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report and under Note Z to the consolidated financial statements.\nSALES AND DISTRIBUTION\nGlobal marketers qualify suppliers on the basis of their ability to provide quality service, innovation and technologies in a cost-effective manner. With its global reach, the Company primarily markets and sells products to customers through its own sales and marketing staff. In some instances, contracts with customers are centrally negotiated, but products are ordered through and distributed directly by the Company’s local facilities. The Company’s facilities are generally located in proximity to their respective major customers. The Company works closely with customers in order to develop new business and to extend the duration of existing contracts.\nMany customers provide the Company with quarterly or annual estimates of product requirements along with related quantities pursuant to which periodic commitments are given. Such estimates assist the Company in managing production and controlling the use of working capital. The Company schedules its production to meet customer requirements. Because the production time for the Company’s rigid packaging products is short, any backlog of customer orders in relation to overall sales is not significant. The standard backlog in Transit Packaging’s automation, equipment and tools business is typically not significant, however, supply chain constraints may increase the backlog from time to time. \nCOMPETITION\nMost of the Company’s packaging products for consumer goods are sold in highly competitive markets, primarily based on price, quality, service and performance. The Company competes with other packaging manufacturers as well as with fillers, food processors and packers, some of whom manufacture containers for their own use and for sale to others. The Company’s competitors include, but are not limited to, Ardagh Metal Packaging, Ball Corporation, Can-Pack S.A., Metal Container Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., Sonoco, and Trivium Packaging.\nTransit Packaging also faces substantial competition from many regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of its products. Transit Packaging differentiates itself from the competition by leveraging its global scale, broad product portfolio and established brand reputation. Transit Packaging products compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including other products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of metal.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nCUSTOMERS\nThe Company’s largest beverage can customers consist of many of the leading manufacturers and marketers of packaged consumer products in the world, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, Heineken, Keurig Dr Pepper, Molson Coors, Pepsi-Cola and Refresco, among others. In addition to sales to Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, the Company also supplies independent licensees of Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola. Consolidation trends among beverage marketers have led to a concentrated customer base. The Company’s top ten global customers represented in the aggregate approximately 48% of its 2024 consolidated net sales. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, two customers each accounted for 12% of the Company's consolidated net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, these two customers each accounted for 12% and 11%, of the Company's consolidated net sales. These customers are global beverage companies served by the Company's beverage operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia. \nEach reportable segment, with the exception of Transit Packaging, has major customers and the loss of one or more of these major customers could have a material adverse effect on an individual segment or the Company as a whole. \nMATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS\nThe Company uses various raw materials, primarily aluminum and steel, in its manufacturing operations. Transit Packaging also uses materials derived from crude oil and natural gas, such as polyethylene and polypropylene. In general, these raw materials are purchased in highly competitive, price-sensitive markets, which have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. These and other materials used in the manufacturing process have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources.\nThe Company has agreements for what it considers adequate supplies of raw materials. However, sufficient quantities may not be available in the future due to, among other things, shortages due to excessive demand, weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by raw material transportation or production delays. From time to time, some of the raw materials have been in short supply but, to date, these shortages have not had a significant impact on the Company’s operations.\nIn 2024, consumption of aluminum and steel represented 46% and 7%, respectively, of consolidated cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Due to the significance of these raw materials to the overall cost of products sold, raw material efficiency is a critical cost component of the products manufactured. Supplier consolidations, changes in ownership, government regulations including tariffs, trade restrictions or retaliatory trade measures, political unrest and increased demand for raw materials in the packaging and other industries, among other risk factors, could cause uncertainty as to the availability of and the level of prices at which the Company might be able to source such raw materials in the future. Moreover, the prices of aluminum and steel can be subject to significant volatility. The Company’s raw material supply contracts vary as to terms and duration, with aluminum contracts typically multi-year in duration with fluctuating prices based on aluminum ingot costs and steel contracts typically one year in duration with fixed prices or set repricing dates. \nThe Company generally attempts to mitigate its aluminum and steel price risk by matching its purchase obligations with its sales agreements; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully mitigate that risk. The Company also uses commodity and foreign currency forwards in an attempt to manage its exposure to aluminum price volatility.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to fully recover from its customers the impact of aluminum and steel price increases or that the use of derivative instruments will effectively manage the Company’s exposure to price volatility. In addition, if the Company were unable to purchase aluminum and steel for a significant period of time, its operations would be disrupted, and if the Company were unable to fully recover the higher cost of aluminum and steel, its financial results may be adversely affected. \nAs a result of continuing global supply and demand pressures, other commodity-related costs affecting the Company’s business may increase as well, including utility and freight-related costs. The Company attempts to increase prices on its products accordingly in order to recover these costs. Certain of the Company's sales contracts contain non-metal pass-through provisions that include annual selling price adjustments based on a producer price index. In certain years the referenced index may be negative, requiring the Company to reduce its selling price while its actual costs may have increased.\nIn response to the volatility of raw material prices, ongoing productivity and cost reduction efforts in recent years have focused on improving raw material cost management. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are dependent, in varying degrees, upon the availability of water and processed energy, such as natural gas and electricity. Certain of these may become difficult or \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nimpossible to obtain on acceptable terms due to external factors, which could increase the Company’s costs or interrupt its business.\nIn addition to mitigating risks around pricing, the Company maintains its commitment to upholding and evolving standards for ethics and compliance as it sources materials. Regular engagement with suppliers is ongoing to manage materials and the impact on environments and communities. The Company strives to ensure partners meet standards for responsible supply as noted in the formal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Through the Twentyby30 program, the Company has committed to sourcing standards that by 2030 require 100% of core raw materials and service suppliers, by spend, to be assessed and comply with Crown Responsible and Ethical Sourcing policies and requirements.\nSUSTAINABILITY\nSustainability remains a core focus of the Company’s business strategy and commitments. The Company recognizes the role of corporate social responsibility and the impact of sustainability performance on economic opportunity and stakeholder relationships, including customers and employees. As a major manufacturer with operations worldwide, the Company can significantly impact industry progress by supporting important sustainability initiatives and adopting practices that create change both within the organization and within partner relationships.\nIn 2020, Crown established its comprehensive Twentyby30 program, setting 20 measurable goals to be reached by 2030 or sooner. These objectives encompass all aspects of sustainability and reflect areas considered material to the Company’s business as well as areas where it can create notable impact. Structured within five core program pillars of Climate Action, Resource Efficiency, Optimum Circularity, Working Together and Never Compromise, these initiatives include efforts such as making operational improvements in energy, water and waste and elevating our focus on material use efficiency, recycling, responsible and ethical sourcing and food contact and safety. \nThe Company maintains a Corporate Environmental Sustainability Policy; a Human Rights Policy; a Responsible and Ethical Sourcing Policy; a Conflict Minerals Policy; and an Environmental, Health and Safety Policy. These policies serve as guidelines for all employees to adhere to as the Company works to advance its sustainability strategy.\nAcross Twentyby30 program pillars, the Company works toward continuous improvement in product design and manufacturing practices to provide the best outcome for the environment, communities, employees and consumers, both now and in the future. \nAluminum and steel contribute to these improvements as, by nature, they are infinitely recyclable without loss of properties. This means they can be used repeatedly to form new consumer packaging with no degradation in performance, quality or safety. Recycling these metals offers significant savings in energy and water consumption, as well as carbon dioxide emissions. As such, the Company is collaborating with industry partners to improve consumer recycling rates and increasing the use of recycled content. In addition, the Company is making strides in its energy and water usage on a global level, working to implement more renewable energy, minimize water usage and execute water replenishment programs. \nThe Company made the following efforts in 2024 to be a more proactive sustainability leader:\n•Commissioned additional water replenishment projects to replenish water used in high water stress regions. The Company now has projects commissioned in: Brazil, Greece, Spain and Tunisia; and\n•Together with The Can Manufacturer’s Institute and the International Aluminium Institute, participated in the second global aluminum can summit to drive further industry movement toward shared sustainability agenda items such as recycled content and climate change mitigation. \nSocially, the Company is continuing to elevate its commitments to community engagement through volunteer opportunities and a charitable giving program, which donates to various non-profit organizations across the regions in which it operates. Within its own workforce, the Company is prioritizing employee welfare and striving to more regularly engage its professionals to foster a more connected global team dedicated to individual and collective improvement as an organization. \nAs a result of its collective efforts, the Company has recently received the following recognitions in 2024:\n4\n\n\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\n•The Company was awarded #1 publicly traded spot within the Containers and Packaging industry category by ESG ratings provider Sustainalytics for managing ESG risk within the Containers and Packaging industry category. This marks the fifth year in a row the Company landed in the top 3% in the \"Containers and Packaging\" category.\n•The Company was named as one of “America’s Climate Leaders” by USA TODAY and Statista.\n•The Company was recognized within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (\"EPA\") Top 30 Green Power Partners from the Fortune 500 list.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nThe Company’s operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, disposal of waste, discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere and the protection of employee health and safety. Future regulations may impose stricter environmental requirements on the packaging industry and may require additional capital investment. Anticipated future restrictions in some jurisdictions on the use of certain coatings may require the Company to employ additional control equipment or process modifications. There can be no assurance that current or future environmental laws or liabilities will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Discussion of the Company’s environmental matters is contained within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report under the caption “Environmental Matters,” and under Note Q to the consolidated financial statements.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 23,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 6,000 employed by the Americas Beverage segment, 3,500 employed by the European Beverage segment, 4,000 employed by the Asia Pacific segment, 7,500 employed by the Transit Packaging segment and 2,000 employed by Other. \nA significant portion of the Company’s workforce is unionized. Collective bargaining agreements with varying terms and expiration dates cover approximately 10,000 employees. The Company did not experience any significant union-initiated work stoppages during the 2024 fiscal year and believes that its employee relations remain good. The Company does not expect that renegotiation of any collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2025 will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow. \nThe Company believes that its employees are key to achieving the Company’s business goals and growth strategy. Attracting, developing and retaining the most skilled and engaged people globally is crucial to all aspects of the Company’s activities. To this end, the Company has cultivated a senior management team with extensive industry experience and highly complementary skill sets and has consistently re‑invested in necessary resources to effectively staff and efficiently support its businesses. It continues to fill corporate and plant roles worldwide with individuals who possess material, design and manufacturing expertise and can cultivate lasting customer relationships. To aid retention, the Company aspires to offer market rate competitive compensation packages to all its staff and it provides professional development opportunities that both contribute to the Company’s success and maximize employees' potential. It also aims to implement a positive and inclusive work environment that prioritizes employee safety, fosters an inclusive atmosphere and creates a fulfilling career. \nThe Company supports the well-being of its employees and their families with a variety of physical, mental and social wellness programs, as well as rigorous on-the-job safety programs. Physical health and wellness programs differ by region, but include Company-sponsored or subsidized medical insurance over and above government provisions, annual medical, cancer and audiometry screenings, and voluntary health fairs. The Company offers employee mental health assistance programs. The Company has built a total safety culture that provides the framework for all health and safety initiatives across the Company and empowers employees to take a proactive role in their safety and that of their fellow employees. The Company’s focus is on behaviors and attitudes and achieving success in incident, injury and near-miss reductions. \nThe Company recognizes that a diverse and inclusive workforce is part of its future business success. It has integrated Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) as a dimension of its Twentyby30 sustainability program, aiming to embed D&I awareness in its organizational culture. The Company believes different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives generate powerful new ideas and foster sound and sustainable decision making. The Company’s approach includes deployment of D&I training initiatives, such as psychological safety and unconscious bias trainings, and improvement of its recruitment and onboarding processes. Recruitment programs to attract diverse talent into the organization include an accelerated manufacturing program, first focused on engineering skills, which includes assignments in various businesses and countries to encourage a flexible mindset. This program provides an opportunity for diverse candidates to progress quickly to higher functions within the organization. The \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nCompany continues to focus on improving gender and cultural diversity in the organization, including developing and empowering minorities and women through greater career opportunity and recognition.\nTo give every employee the opportunity to feel heard, supported and valued and to continue building its inclusive culture, the Company implemented a new employee engagement survey globally. The Company aims to better understand what the employee experience looks like at Crown, what works well and what can be improved.\nThe Company places a high value on skills management and lifelong learning opportunities that benefit both the individual employee and the whole Company. The Company provides a variety of educational opportunities, including a mix of mandatory and voluntary training programs that occur in classrooms, online and on the job. The Company also recognizes the importance of multifunctional teams and as such, management training includes international exposure and cross-divisional activity to develop common approaches and values. Talent development programs vary by region, but include leadership programs designed to support operations leadership, lean manufacturing operations and employee performance management. \nWhile updating its Human Rights policy based on the latest legal developments, the company has developed a comprehensive Human Rights training program translated into the predominant local languages used within our organization. This program is designed to improve our employees’ understanding, awareness and commitment to human rights principles within our organization.\nThe Company maintains a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which describes its policies with respect to, among other things, anti-corruption, protection of confidential information, and environmental, health and safety matters, as well as the Company’s commitment to ensuring that all employees are treated with respect and dignity and are able to work in an environment free from all forms of unlawful employment discrimination. The Company’s compliance teams are responsible for implementing these policies. The Company's compliance program includes a mechanism for employees to report suspected violations of Company policies on a confidential basis, including anonymous reporting where permitted by local law.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nThe Company's global Research, Development & Engineering (\"RD&E\") Center for packaging products for consumer goods is located in Wantage, U.K. The Company utilizes its centralized corporate RD&E capabilities to advance and deliver technologies for the Company's worldwide packaging activities that (1) promote development of value-added metal packaging systems for its customers, (2) design cost-efficient manufacturing processes, systems and materials and material-efficient container designs that further the sustainability of metal packaging, (3) provide continuous quality and/or production efficiency improvements in its manufacturing facilities, (4) advance customer and supplier relationships, and (5) provide value-added engineering services and technical support. These capabilities facilitate (1) the identification of new and/or expanded market opportunities by working directly with customers to develop new packaging products or enhance existing packaging products through the application of new technologies that better differentiate customers' products in the retail environment (for example, the creation of new packaging shapes, novel decoration methods, or the addition of digital content through unique codes) and/or the incorporation of consumer-valued features (for example, improved openability and/or ease of use) and (2) the reduction of manufacturing costs by reducing the material content of the Company's products (while retaining necessary performance characteristics), reducing spoilage, and increasing operating efficiencies in manufacturing facilities. The corporate RD&E Center is also applying technical expertise to advance product design and manufacturing capabilities for the Company's beverage equipment operations and its Transit Packaging segment, supplementing the group's existing product developments.\nThe Company maintains a substantial portfolio of patents and other intellectual property (\"IP\") in the field of metal packaging systems and seeks strategic partnerships to extend its IP in existing and emerging markets. As a result, the Company has licensed IP in geographic regions where the Company has a limited market presence today. Existing technologies such as SuperEnd® beverage ends, 360 End™ beverage ends, Easy-Flow™ beverage ends and can shaping have been licensed in Europe, Australia, Japan, and Africa to provide customers with global access to Crown's brand building innovations. In addition to package components, the Company maintains a legacy of innovation that features numerous industry-firsts, including launching new interactive inks, decorative and shaping techniques, new package sizes and styles and new canmaking technologies. Recent examples include the Company’s Accents™ variable printing technology, which facilitates up to 24 different beverage can designs in a single run, and its Quantum™ debossing technology, which implements unique textures on food cans that replace can wall beading with proprietary debossed patterns, such as hexagonal or oval arrays, to prevent counterfeiting and reduce material usage by up to 13%. The RD&E team has also expanded efforts to advance innovations through strategic partnerships with suppliers and through the use of Open Innovation to access new technologies. These efforts are aimed at enhancing the Company's products for our customers by developing improved coatings with enhanced barriers, new decoration technology (such as digital printing), and improved container functionality (such as enhanced resealability).\nTransit Packaging is also well known throughout its markets for its ability to drive product innovation and leadership in new technologies. Transit Packaging focuses on market driven innovation and has a long history of creating product and service \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nsolutions that solve problems and create value for its customers. Transit Packaging has grown its global patent portfolio to nearly 360 U.S. issued patents or pending patent applications and over 980 foreign issued patents or pending patent applications. The portfolio broadly covers over 350 customized technologies and spans diverse business platforms, as well as the different countries in which it operates.\nThe Company spent $32 million in 2024, $33 million in 2023, and $34 million in 2022 in its RD&E activities. \nWORKING CAPITAL\nThe Company historically uses cash during the first nine months of the year to finance seasonal working capital needs. Beverage products are generally consumed in greater amounts during the warmer months and the food packaging business is somewhat seasonal with the first quarter tending to be the slowest period as the autumn packaging period in the Northern Hemisphere has ended and new crops are not yet planted. The Company’s working capital requirements are funded by cash flows from operations, revolving credit facilities and receivables securitization and factoring programs.\nFurther information relating to the Company’s liquidity and capital resources is set forth within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report under the caption “Liquidity” and under Note N to the consolidated financial statements.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe Company’s website address is www.crowncork.com.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report and in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" the following are some of the important factors that could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. \nRisks Relating to the Company's Business and Industry\nThe Company's profits will decline if the price of raw materials or energy rises and it cannot increase the price of its products, and the Company's financial results could be adversely affected if the Company was not able to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials. \nThe Company uses various raw materials, such as aluminum, steel, tin, and materials derived from crude oil and natural gas, such as polyethylene and polypropylene resin, and also water, natural gas, electricity and other processed energy, in its manufacturing activities. Sufficient quantities of these raw materials may not be available in the future or may be available only at increased prices. In 2024, consumption of aluminum and steel represented 46% and 7% of the Company's consolidated cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. The Company's raw material supply contracts vary as to terms and duration, with aluminum contracts typically multi-year in duration with fluctuating prices based on aluminum ingot costs and steel contracts typically one year in duration with fixed prices. The availability of various raw materials and their prices depend on global and local supply and demand forces, governmental regulations and trade policies (including tariffs and duties), level of production, resource availability, transportation, and other factors, including natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, and pandemics (including possible reemergence of the COVID 19 pandemic). The U.S. has recently signaled its intention to change U.S. trade policy, including potentially renegotiating or terminating existing trade agreements and \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nleveraging tariffs. In February 2025, the U.S. imposed additional tariffs on aluminum and steel as well as on imports from China and announced and subsequently paused implementation of tariffs from Canada and Mexico. These additional tariffs, as well as potential retaliation by another government against such tariffs or policies could significantly affect the price of steel, aluminum and other raw materials used by the Company, which may adversely affect the Company's profits and financial results.\nIn recent years the consolidation of steel suppliers, shortage of raw materials affecting the production of steel and the increased global demand for steel, have contributed to an overall tighter supply for steel, resulting in increased steel prices and, in some cases, special surcharges and allocated cut backs of products by steel suppliers. Moreover, future steel supply contracts may provide for prices that fluctuate or adjust rather than provide a fixed price during a one-year period. As a result of continuing global supply and demand pressures, other commodity-related costs affecting the Company's business may increase as well, including natural gas, electricity and freight-related costs.\nThe prices of certain raw materials used by the Company, such as aluminum, steel and energy, have historically been subject to \nvolatility. The Company continues to manage the challenges of supply chain disruptions and fluctuating costs for raw materials and energy. While certain, but not all, of the Company's contracts pass through raw material costs to customers, the Company may be unable to increase its prices to offset increases in raw material costs without suffering reductions in unit volume, revenue and operating income. The Company also uses commodity forward contracts to manage its exposure to these raw material costs. The ability to mitigate inflationary risks through these measures varies by region and the impact on the results of the Company's segments for the year-ended December 31, 2024 is discussed, as applicable in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations.\"\nIn addition, any price increases may take effect after related cost increases, reducing operating income in the near term. Significant increases in raw material costs may increase the Company's working capital requirements, which may increase the Company's average outstanding indebtedness and interest expense and may exceed the amounts available under the Company's senior secured credit facilities and other sources of liquidity. In addition, the Company hedges raw material costs on behalf of certain customers and may suffer losses if such customers are unable to satisfy their purchase obligations. \nIf the Company is unable to purchase aluminum, steel, resins or other raw materials for a significant period of time, the Company's operations would be disrupted and any such disruption may adversely affect the Company's financial results. If customers believe that the Company's competitors have greater access to raw materials, perceived certainty of supply at the Company's competitors may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage with respect to pricing and product volumes.\nThe Company's principal markets may be subject to overcapacity and intense competition, which could reduce the Company's net sales and net income. \nBeverage and food cans are standardized products, allowing for relatively little differentiation among competitors. This could lead to overcapacity and price competition among beverage and food can producers if capacity growth outpaced the growth in demand for beverage and food cans and overall manufacturing capacity exceeded demand. These market conditions could reduce product prices and contribute to declining revenue and net income. Competitive pricing pressures, overcapacity, the failure to develop new product designs and technologies for products, as well as other factors, such as consolidation among the Company's competitors, could cause the Company to lose existing business or opportunities to generate new business and could result in decreased cash flow and net income.\nThe Company is subject to competition from substitute products and decreases in demand for its products, which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows. \nThe Company is subject to substantial competition from producers of alternative packaging made from glass, paper, flexible materials and plastic. The Company's sales depend heavily on the volumes of sales by the Company's customers in the beverage and food markets. Changes in preferences for products and packaging by consumers of beverage cans and prepackaged food cans significantly influence the Company's sales. Changes in packaging by the Company's customers may require the Company to re-tool manufacturing operations, which could require material expenditures. In addition, a decrease in the costs of, or a further increase in consumer demand for, alternative packaging could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows for the Company. For example, increases in the price of aluminum and steel and decreases in the price of plastic resin, which is a petrochemical product and may fluctuate with prices in the oil and gas market, may increase substitution of plastic food and beverage containers for metal containers, or increases in the price of steel may increase substitution of aluminum packaging for aerosol products. Moreover, due to its high percentage of fixed costs, the Company may be unable to maintain its gross margin at past levels if it is not able to achieve high capacity utilization rates for its production equipment. In periods of low worldwide demand for its products or in situations where industry expansion creates excess capacity, the Company experiences relatively \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nlow capacity utilization rates in its operations, which can lead to reduced margins and can have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe Company's business results depend on its ability to understand its customers' specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture and market products that meet customer demand.\nThe Company's ability to develop new product offerings for a diverse group of global customers with differing preferences, while maintaining functionality and spurring innovation, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of the Company's existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in developing markets and areas, such as the Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe and Asia. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's business.\nLoss of third-party transportation providers upon whom the Company depends or increases in fuel prices could increase the Company's costs or cause a disruption in the Company's operations.\nThe Company depends generally upon third-party transportation providers for delivery of products to customers. Strikes, slowdowns, transportation disruptions or other conditions in the transportation industry, including, but not limited to, shortages of truck drivers, disruptions in rail service, decreases in the availability of vessels or increases in fuel prices, could increase the Company's costs and disrupt Company’s operations and its ability to service customers on a timely basis or cost-effective basis.\nThe Company's business is seasonal and weather conditions could reduce the Company's net sales. \nThe Company manufactures metal and glass packaging primarily for the beverage and food can market. Its sales can be affected by weather conditions. Due principally to the seasonal nature of the soft drink, brewing, iced tea and other beverage industries, in which demand is stronger during the summer months, sales of the Company's products are expected to vary by quarter and by region. Unseasonably cool weather can reduce consumer demand for certain beverages packaged in the Company's containers. In addition, poor weather conditions that reduce crop yields of packaged foods can decrease customer demand for its food containers. \nThe Company has a significant amount of goodwill that, if impaired in the future, would result in lower reported net income and a reduction of its net worth. \nImpairment of the Company's goodwill would require a write down of goodwill, which would reduce the Company's net income in the period of any such write down. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the Company's goodwill was $3 billion. The Company is required to evaluate goodwill reflected on its balance sheet at least annually or when circumstances indicate a potential impairment. If it determines that the goodwill is impaired, the Company would be required to write off a portion or all of the goodwill.\nA significant portion of the Company's workforce is unionized and labor disruptions could increase the Company's costs and prevent the Company from supplying its customers.\nA significant portion of the Company's workforce is unionized, and a prolonged work stoppage or strike at any facility with unionized employees could increase costs and prevent the Company from supplying its customers. In addition, upon the expiration of existing collective bargaining agreements, the Company may not reach new agreements without union or works council action in certain jurisdictions, and any such new agreements may not be on terms satisfactory to the Company. If the Company is unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, it may become subject to union-initiated work stoppages, including strikes. Moreover, additional groups of currently non-unionized employees may seek union or works council representation in the future. \nFailure by the Company's joint venture partners to observe their obligations could adversely affect the business and operations of the joint ventures and, in turn, the business and operations of the Company. \nA portion of the Company's operations, including certain beverage can operations in Asia, the Middle East and South America, is conducted through joint ventures. The Company participates in these ventures with third parties. In the event that the Company's joint venture partners do not observe their obligations or are unable to commit additional capital to the joint ventures, it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with its business plans or that the Company would have to increase its level of commitment to the joint venture. \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe loss of the Company's intellectual property rights may negatively impact its ability to compete. \nIf the Company is unable to maintain the proprietary nature of its technologies, its competitors may use its technologies to compete with it. The Company has a number of patents covering various aspects of its products, including its SuperEnd® beverage can end, whose primary patent expired in 2016 and Ideal™ product line. The Company's patents may not withstand challenge in litigation, and patents do not ensure that competitors will not develop competing products or infringe upon the Company's patents. Moreover, the costs of litigation to defend the Company's patents could be substantial and may outweigh the benefits of enforcing its rights under its patents. The Company markets its products internationally, and the patent laws of foreign countries may offer less protection than the patent laws of the U.S. Not all of the Company's domestic patents have been registered in other countries. The Company also relies on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology, and others may independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to the Company's unpatented technology. In addition, the Company has from time to time received letters from third parties suggesting that it may be infringing on their intellectual property rights, and third parties may bring infringement suits against the Company, which could result in the Company needing to seek licenses from these third parties or refraining altogether from use of the claimed technology. \nBusiness interruptions at the Company’s facilities could adversely impact the Company’s operations and financial results. \nOur operations depend heavily on the uninterrupted performance of our manufacturing facilities. Any significant disruption, whether due to natural disasters (such as earthquakes, fires, floods, or hurricanes), equipment failures, power outages, labor disputes, cyberattacks, supply chain breakdowns, or public health crises could materially impair our ability to produce and deliver products on schedule. Such events could lead to increased costs from repairs, lost production, or contractual penalties, as well as damage to customer relationships if we fail to meet demand. We carry insurance for certain interruptions, but coverage may not extend to all scenarios, may involve significant deductibles, or may be insufficient to offset losses. \nRisks Relating to the Company's International Operations \nThe Company's international operations, which generated approximately 63% of its consolidated net sales in 2024, are subject to various risks that may lead to decreases in its financial results, particularly in the case of the Company's operations in emerging markets. \nThe Company is an international company, and the risks associated with operating in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and with operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries generally, exposes the Company to potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices and legal and regulatory requirements and may have a negative impact on the Company’s liquidity and net income. The Company's international operations generated approximately 63% of its consolidated net sales in the years ended 2024, 2023 and 2022. In addition, the Company’s business strategy includes continued expansion of international activities, including within developing markets and areas, such as the Middle East, South America, Eastern Europe and Asia, that may pose political and economic volatility and instability, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than the Company’s other markets. The Company’s expansion efforts may also use capital and other resources of the Company that could be invested in other areas. Further, if a downturn in economic conditions ultimately leads to a significant devaluation of a foreign currency such as the euro, the value of any financial assets that are denominated in that currency may be reduced when translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Any of these conditions could ultimately harm the Company’s overall business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. \nEmerging markets are a focus of the Company’s international growth strategy, and the Company’s success in developing market share and operating profitably in these markets is critical to the Company’s growth. The developing nature of these markets and the nature of the Company’s international operations generally are subject to various risks, including: \n•foreign governments' restrictive trade policies; \n•conflicting regulation (including with respect to product labelling, privacy, data protection and advanced technologies) and policy changes by foreign agencies or governments; \n•duties, taxes or government royalties, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries; \n•customs, import/export control and other trade compliance regulations; \n•foreign exchange rate risks and exchange controls; \n•difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentially longer payment cycles; \n•increased costs in maintaining international manufacturing and marketing efforts; \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\n•non-tariff barriers and higher duty rates; \n•difficulties associated with expatriating or repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner;\n•changes in tax laws and regulations; \n•difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights and difficulties in protecting intellectual property or sensitive commercial and operations data or information technology systems generally; \n•national and regional labor strikes and work stoppages; \n•geographic, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world; \n•high social benefit costs for labor, including costs associated with restructurings; \n•civil unrest or political, social, legal and economic instability; \n•product boycotts, including with respect to the products of the Company's multi-national customers;\n•customer, supplier, and investor concerns regarding operations in areas such as the Middle East; \n•taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation; \n•imposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into dollars or payment of dividends and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries; \n•hyperinflation and currency devaluation in any country where such currency devaluation could affect the amount of cash generated by operations in that country and thereby affect the Company's ability to satisfy its obligations; \n•geographical concentration of the Company’s factories and operations and regional shifts in its customer base; \n•war (such as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the Israel - Hamas conflict, and other hostilities in the Middle-East), civil disturbance, global or regional catastrophic events, natural disasters, and acts of terrorism; \n•epidemics, pandemics, and other disease outbreaks and health crises (such as the possible reemergence of the COVID-19 pandemic);\n•the complexity of managing global operations; and\n•compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery laws and anti-money laundering laws and sanctions; and continuing legal, political and economic uncertainty following Brexit.\nAs emerging geographic markets become more important to the Company, its competitors are also seeking to expand their production capacities and sales in these same markets, which may lead to industry overcapacity that could adversely affect pricing, volumes and financial results in such markets. Although the Company is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, the Company’s reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful. Furthermore, the continuing and accelerating globalization of businesses in emerging markets and elsewhere could significantly change the dynamics of the Company’s competition, customer base and product offerings, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial position. \nThe Company is subject to the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may reduce its net sales and cash flow. \nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies as a significant portion of its consolidated net sales, costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's international operations generated approximately 63% of its consolidated net sales in the years ended 2024, 2023 and 2022. Volatility in exchange rates may increase the costs of the Company's products, impair the purchasing power of its customers in different markets, result in significant competitive benefit to certain of its competitors who incur a material part of their costs in other currencies than it does, increase its hedging costs, and limit its ability to hedge exchange rate exposure. Although the Company may use financial instruments such as foreign currency forwards from time to time to reduce its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations in some cases, it may not elect or have the ability to implement hedges or, if it does implement them, there can be no assurance that such agreements will achieve the desired effect. In its consolidated financial statements, the Company translates local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, its reported international revenue and earnings will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Conversely, a weakening U.S. dollar will effectively increase the dollar-equivalent of the Company's expenses and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Market Risk” and \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\" in this Annual Report.\nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nFor the year-ended 2024, the Company was primarily impacted by changes in the Mexican peso, the euro, the Chinese yuan and the Thai baht. Additionally, the Company's Transit Packaging segment is a global business and is also impacted by changes in the Indian rupee, the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real. For the year-ended December 31, 2024, a 10% movement in the average foreign exchange rates used to translate income and expense items during the year would have decreased net income by approximately $11 million. \nRisks Relating to the Company's Indebtedness and Liquidity\nThe substantial indebtedness of the Company could prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its debt agreements.\nThe Company has substantial outstanding indebtedness. As a result of the Company's substantial indebtedness, a significant portion of the Company's cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on its outstanding indebtedness, and the Company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or have future borrowings available under its senior secured credit facilities, to enable it to repay its indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2024, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately $6.2 billion of indebtedness, excluding unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs.\nThe Company’s current sources of liquidity includes a securitization facility with a program limit up to a maximum of $800 million that expires in July 2025 and securitization facilities with program limits of $230 million and $160 million that expire in November 2025. Additional sources of the Company's liquidity include borrowings under its $1,650 million revolving credit facilities that mature in August 2027. \nThe Company's indebtedness includes its $875 million 4.75% senior notes due in February 2026; its €500 million ($518 million at December 31, 2024) 2.875% senior notes due in February 2026; its $400 million 4.25% senior notes due in September 2026; its $350 million 7.375% senior notes due in December 2026; its €500 million ($518 million at December 31, 2024) 5.00% senior notes due in May 2028; its €500 million ($518 million at December 31, 2024) 4.75% senior notes due in March 2029; its €600 million ($621 million at December 31, 2024) 4.50% senior notes due in January 2030; its $500 million 5.25% senior notes due in April 2030; its $40 million 7.50% senior notes due in December 2096; and its $118 million of other indebtedness in various currencies due at various dates through 2027. In addition, the Company’s term loan facilities mature as follows: $21 million in 2025, $28 million in 2026, $1,664 million in 2027.\nThe substantial indebtedness of the Company could: \n\n•increase the Company's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including rising interest rates;\n•restrict the Company from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting business opportunities, including any planned expansion in emerging markets; \n•limit the Company's ability to make capital expenditures both domestically and internationally in order to grow the Company's business or maintain manufacturing plants in good working order and repair; \n•limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants under the Company's debt agreements, the Company's ability to obtain additional financing, dispose of assets or pay cash dividends; \n•require the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to service its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements; \n•require the Company to sell assets used in its business; \n•limit the Company's ability to refinance its existing indebtedness, particularly during periods of adverse credit market conditions when refinancing indebtedness may not be available under interest rates and other terms acceptable to the Company or at all; \n•increase the Company's cost of borrowing; \n•limit the Company's flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and \n•place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt. \nIf its financial condition, operating results and liquidity deteriorate, the Company's creditors may restrict its ability to obtain future financing and its suppliers could require prepayment or cash on delivery rather than extend credit, which could further diminish the Company's ability to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to service its debt obligations. In addition, the Company's ability to make payments on and refinance its debt and to fund its operations will depend on the Company's ability to generate cash in the future. \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nSome of the Company's indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which would result in the Company's interest expense increasing if interest rates rise. \nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately $1.8 billion of the Company's $6.2 billion of total indebtedness and $1.1 billion of securitization and factoring programs were subject to floating interest rates. Changes in economic conditions could result in higher interest rates, thereby increasing the Company's interest expense and reducing funds available for operations or other purposes. The Company's annual interest expense was $452 million, $436 million and $284 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Based on the amount of variable rate debt outstanding and securitization and factoring at December 31, 2024, a 0.25% increase in variable interest rates would increase its annual interest expense by approximately $7 million before tax. Accordingly, the Company may experience economic losses and a negative impact on earnings as a result of interest rate fluctuation. The actual effect of a 0.25% increase in these floating interest rates could be more than $7 million as the Company’s average borrowings on its variable rate debt and securitization and factoring may be higher during the year than the amount at December 31, 2024. Although the Company may use interest rate protection agreements from time to time to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations in some cases, it may not elect or have the ability to implement hedges or, if it does implement them, there can be no assurance that such agreements will achieve the desired effect. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Market Risk” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this Annual Report.\nRestrictive covenants in the debt agreements governing the Company's current or future indebtedness could restrict the Company's operating flexibility. \nThe indentures and agreements governing the Company's senior secured credit facilities and outstanding notes contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to take certain actions. These restrictions may limit the Company's ability to operate its business and may prohibit or limit its ability to enhance its operations or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The Company's senior secured credit facilities require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions. The agreements or indentures governing the Company's senior secured credit facilities and certain of its outstanding notes restrict, among other things, the ability of the Company and the ability of all or substantially all of its subsidiaries to: \n•incur additional debt; \n•pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase capital stock, repurchase subordinated debt and make certain investments or loans; \n•create liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions; \n•create restrictions on the payment of dividends and other amounts to the Company from subsidiaries; \n•make loans, investments and capital expenditures; \n•change accounting treatment and reporting practices; \n•enter into agreements restricting the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends to, make or repay loans to, transfer property to, or guarantee indebtedness of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries; \n•sell or acquire assets, enter into leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with or into other companies; and \n•engage in transactions with affiliates. \nIn addition, the indentures and agreements governing the Company's senior secured credit facilities and certain of its outstanding notes limit, among other things, the ability of the Company to enter into certain transactions, such as mergers, consolidations, joint ventures, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions and the pledging of assets. \nThe breach of any of these covenants by the Company or the failure by the Company to maintain any of these ratios or meet any of these conditions could result in a default under any or all of such indebtedness. If a default occurs under any such indebtedness, all of the outstanding obligations thereunder could become immediately due and payable, which could result in a default under the Company's other outstanding debt and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to the Company's senior secured credit facilities, outstanding notes and other outstanding debt. The ability of the Company to comply with these covenants and the covenants in agreements it may enter into in the future can be affected by events beyond its control and, therefore, it may be unable to satisfy its obligations under its debt agreements. \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nNotwithstanding the Company's current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, the Company may still be able to incur substantial additional debt or make certain restricted payments, which could exacerbate the risks described above. \nThe Company may be able to incur additional debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions or joint ventures. Although the Company's senior secured credit facilities and indentures governing certain of its outstanding notes contain restrictions on the Company's ability to incur indebtedness, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. The Company may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions or increased capital expenditures, which may increase the Company's indebtedness. Moreover, although the Company's senior secured credit facilities and indentures governing certain of its outstanding notes contain restrictions on the Company’s ability to make restricted payments, including the declaration and payment of dividends and the repurchase of the Company’s common stock, the Company is able to make such restricted payments under certain circumstances which may increase indebtedness. Adding new debt to current debt levels or making otherwise restricted payments could intensify the related risks that the Company and its subsidiaries now face. \nThe Company's senior secured credit facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute an event of default. In the event of a change of control, the Company may not be able to satisfy all of its obligations under the senior secured credit facilities or other indebtedness. \nThe Company may not have sufficient assets or be able to obtain sufficient third-party financing on favorable terms to satisfy all of its obligations under the Company's senior secured credit facilities or other indebtedness in the event of a change of control. The Company's senior secured credit facilities provide that certain change of control events constitute an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities. Such an event of default entitles the lenders thereunder to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt obligations under the senior secured credit facilities to become due and payable and to proceed against the collateral securing the senior secured credit facilities. Any event of default or acceleration of the senior secured credit facilities will likely also cause a default under the terms of other indebtedness of the Company. In addition, the indentures governing certain of the Company's outstanding notes require that the Company offer to repurchase the notes at an offer price of 101% of principal upon certain change of control repurchase events.\nThe Company is subject to certain restrictions that may limit its ability to make payments on its debt out of the cash reserves shown on the Company's consolidated financial statements. \nThe ability of the Company's subsidiaries and joint ventures to pay dividends, make distributions, provide loans or make other payments to the Company may be restricted by applicable state and foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences and their agreements, including agreements governing their debt. In addition, the equity interests of the Company's joint venture partners or other shareholders in the Company's non-wholly owned subsidiaries in any dividend or other distribution made by these entities would need to be satisfied on a proportionate basis with the Company. As a result, the Company may not be able to access a portion of its cash flow to service the Company's debt.\nThe Company has significant pension plan obligations worldwide and significant unfunded postretirement obligations, which could reduce its cash flow and negatively impact its results of operations and its financial condition. \nThe Company sponsors various pension plans worldwide, with the largest funded plans in the U.S. and Canada. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company contributed $122 million, $19 million, and $24 million to its pension plans. The 2024 contributions included approximately $100 million to its U.S. pension plan in advance of a partial settlement of the plan's obligations. Pension expense was $562 million, including settlement charges of $47 million and $469 million for the Canadian and U.S. pension plans and is expected to be $32 million in 2025, using foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2024. A 0.50% change in the 2025 expected rate of return assumptions would change 2025 pension expense by approximately $2 million. A 0.50% change in the discount rates assumptions as of December 31, 2024 would change 2025 pension expense by approximately $4 million. The Company may be required to accelerate the timing of its contributions under its pension plans. The actual impact of any accelerated funding will depend upon the interest rates required for determining the plan liabilities and the investment performance of plan assets. An acceleration in the timing of pension plan contributions could decrease the Company's cash available to pay its outstanding obligations and its net income and increase the Company's outstanding indebtedness. \nBased on current assumptions, the Company expects to make pension contributions of $20 million in 2025, $29 million in 2026, $27 million in 2027, $51 million in 2028 and $28 million in 2029. Future changes in the factors used to determine pension contributions, including investment performance of plan assets, could have a significant impact on the Company’s future contributions and its cash flow available for debt reduction, capital expenditures or other purposes. \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe difference between pension plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, significantly affects the net periodic benefit costs of the Company's pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Among other factors, significant volatility in the equity markets and in the value of illiquid alternative investments, changes in discount rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can substantially increase the Company's future pension plan funding requirements and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations and profitability. See Note S to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report. As long as the Company continues to maintain its various pension plans, the Company will continue to incur additional pension obligations. The Company's pension plan assets consist primarily of common stocks and fixed income securities and also include alternative investments such as interests in private equity and hedge funds. If the performance of plan assets does not meet the Company's assumptions or discount rates decline, the underfunding of the pension plans may increase and the Company may have to contribute additional funds to the pension plans, and the Company's pension expense may increase. In addition, certain of the Company's pension and postretirement plans are unfunded. \nThe Company's U.S. funded pension plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. Under ERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC, has the authority to terminate an underfunded plan under certain circumstances. In the event its U.S. pension plan is terminated for any reason while the plan is underfunded, the Company will incur a liability to the PBGC that may be equal to the entire amount of the underfunding, which under certain circumstances may be senior to the Company's outstanding notes. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, the unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, as calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, for retiree medical benefits was approximately $96 million, based on assumptions set forth under Note S to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.\nRisks Relating to Litigation and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company is subject to litigation risks which could negatively impact its operations and net income. \nThe Company is subject to various lawsuits and claims with respect to matters such as governmental, environmental and employee benefits laws and regulations, securities, labor, and actions arising out of the normal course of business, in addition to asbestos-related litigation described under the risk factor titled “Pending and future asbestos litigation and payments to settle asbestos-related claims could reduce the Company's cash flow and negatively impact its financial condition.” The Company is currently unable to determine the total expense or possible loss, if any, that may ultimately be incurred in the resolution of such legal proceedings. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of such legal proceedings, they could result in significant diversion of time by the Company's management. The results of the Company's pending legal proceedings, including any potential settlements, are uncertain and the outcome of these disputes may decrease its cash available for operations and investment, restrict its operations or otherwise negatively impact its business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.\nIn March 2015, the Bundeskartellamt, or German Federal Cartel Office (“FCO”), conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including a German subsidiary of the Company. The local court order authorizing the inspection cited FCO suspicions of anti-competitive agreements in the German market for the supply of metal packaging products. The Company conducted an internal investigation into the matter and discovered instances of inappropriate conduct by certain employees of German subsidiaries of the Company. The Company cooperated with the FCO and submitted a leniency application with the FCO which disclosed the findings of its internal investigation to date. In April 2018, the FCO discontinued its national investigation and referred the matter to the European Commission (the “Commission”). Following the referral, Commission officials conducted unannounced inspections of the premises of several metal packaging manufacturers, including Company subsidiaries in Germany, France and the U.K. The Company cooperated with the Commission and submitted a leniency application with the Commission with respect to the findings of its internal investigation in Germany. In July 2022, the Company reached a settlement with the Commission relating to the Commission’s investigation, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay a fine in the amount of $8. Fining decisions based on settlements can be appealed under EU law and the Company sought annulment of the Commission’s fining decision on the basis that the referral of the case from the FCO to the Commission was unjustified. In October 2024, the General Court of the EU issued a judgment dismissing the Company’s appeal. In December 2024, the Company appealed the General Court’s judgment to the European Court of Justice. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of such appeal.\nOn October 7, 2021, the French Autorité de la concurrence (the French Competition Authority or “FCA”) issued a statement of objections to 14 trade associations, one public entity and 101 legal entities from 28 corporate groups, including the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, other leading metal can manufacturers, certain can fillers and certain retailers in France. The FCA alleged violations of Articles 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and L.420-1 of the French Commercial Code. The statement of objections alleges, among other things, anti-competitive behavior in connection with the removal of bisphenol-A from metal packaging in France. The removal of bisphenol-A was mandated by French legislation that went into \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\neffect in 2015. On December 29, 2023, the FCA issued a decision imposing a fine of €4 million on the Company. The Company intends to appeal the decision of the FCA and there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of such appeal. \nPending and future asbestos litigation and payments to settle asbestos-related claims could reduce the Company's cash flow and negatively impact its financial condition. \nCrown Cork & Seal Company, Inc. (Crown Cork), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is one of many defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits filed throughout the U.S. by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos. In 1963, Crown Cork acquired a subsidiary that had two operating businesses, one of which is alleged to have manufactured asbestos-containing insulation products. Crown Cork believes that the business ceased manufacturing such products in 1963. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Crown Cork's accrual for pending and future asbestos-related claims and related legal costs was $185 million, including $141 million for unasserted claims. The Company determines its accrual without limitation to a specific time period. Assumptions underlying the accrual include that claims for exposure to asbestos that occurred after the sale of the subsidiary's insulation business in 1964 would not be entitled to settlement payouts and that state statutes described under Note P to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, including Texas and Pennsylvania statutes, are expected to have a highly favorable impact on Crown Cork's ability to settle or defend against asbestos-related claims in those states and other states where Pennsylvania law may apply. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Crown Cork received approximately 1,400 new claims, settled or dismissed approximately 600 claims, and had approximately 59,300 claims outstanding at the end of the period. Of the Company's outstanding claims, approximately 18,000 claims relate to claimants alleging first exposure to asbestos after 1964 and approximately 41,300 relate to claimants alleging first exposure to asbestos before or during 1964, of which approximately 13,000 were filed in Texas, 1,300 were filed in Pennsylvania, 6,000 were filed in other states that have enacted asbestos legislation and 21,000 were filed in other states. Due to the passage of time, the Company considers it unlikely that the plaintiffs in these cases will pursue further action. The exclusion of these inactive claims had no effect on the calculation of the Company's accrual as the claims were filed in states where the Company's liability is limited by statute. The Company devotes significant time and expense to defend against these various claims, complaints and proceedings, and there can be no assurance that the expenses or distractions from operating the Company's business arising from these defenses will not increase materially. \nCrown Cork made cash payments of $15 million, $17 million and $21 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022 to settle asbestos claims and pay related legal and defense costs. These payments and any such future payments will reduce the cash flow available to Crown Cork for its business operations and debt payments. \nAsbestos-related payments including defense costs may be significantly higher than those estimated by Crown Cork because the outcome of this type of litigation (and, therefore, Crown Cork's reserve) is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties, such as the number or size of asbestos-related claims or settlements, the number of financially viable responsible parties, the extent to which state statutes relating to asbestos liability are upheld and/or applied by the courts, Crown Cork's ability to obtain resolution without payment of asbestos-related claims by persons alleging first exposure to asbestos after 1964, and the potential impact of any pending or future asbestos-related legislation. Accordingly, Crown Cork may be required to make payments for claims substantially in excess of its accrual, which could reduce the Company's cash flow and impair its ability to satisfy its obligations. Further information regarding Crown's Cork's asbestos-related liabilities is presented within “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings, “Provision for Asbestos” and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and under Note P to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nThe Company is subject to costs and liabilities related to stringent environmental and health and safety standards.\nLaws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety may increase the Company’s costs of operating and reduce its profitability. The Company’s operations are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including those relating to operating permits, treatment, storage and disposal of waste, the use of chemicals in the Company’s products and manufacturing process, discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination and protection of employee health and safety. Future regulations may impose stricter environmental or employee safety requirements affecting the Company’s operations or may impose additional requirements regarding consumer health and safety, such as potential restrictions on the use of bisphenol-A, a starting material used to produce internal and external coatings for some food, beverage, and aerosol containers and metal closures. The EU and Canada have banned the use of bisphenol-A in baby bottles, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") has considered adding bisphenol-A, which it has described as a potential reproductive, developmental, and \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nsystemic toxicant, to the chemical concern list and using its Design for the Environment program to encourage reductions in bisphenol-A manufacturing and use. Certain other nations, including Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and France, have implemented or considered implementing legislation restricting the use of bisphenol-A, including imposing product labeling requirements or restrictions on the importation and placement in the market of packaging and utensils containing bisphenol-A, and the European Food Safety Authority has recommended that the tolerable daily intake of bisphenol-A be lowered. Domestic and international, federal, state, municipal or other regulatory authorities could further restrict or prohibit the use of bisphenol-A in the future. In addition, public reports, litigation and other allegations regarding the potential health hazards of bisphenol-A could contribute to a perceived safety risk about the Company’s products and adversely impact sales or otherwise disrupt the Company’s business. While the Company is exploring various alternatives to the use of bisphenol-A and conversion to alternatives is underway in some applications, there can be no assurance the Company will be completely successful in its efforts or that the alternatives will not be more costly to the Company.\nAlso, for example, future restrictions in some jurisdictions on air emissions of volatile organic compounds and the use of certain paint and lacquering ingredients may require the Company to employ additional control equipment or process modifications. The Company’s operations and properties, both in the U.S. and abroad, must comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, a number of governmental authorities in the U.S. and abroad have introduced or are contemplating enacting legal requirements, including emissions limitations, cap and trade systems or mandated changes in energy consumption, in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Given the wide range of potential future climate change regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the potential impact of both climate change and climate change regulation is uncertain. \nClimate change and evolving laws, regulations and market trends in response to climate change could adversely affect the business and operations of the Company.\nThe Company may incur significant costs and experience operational disruptions as a result of increases in the frequency, severity or duration of severe weather events caused by climate change (including thunderstorms, hurricanes, blizzards, wildfires, flooding, typhoons and tornados), and may incur additional costs to prepare for, respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change. Furthermore, in the event that severe weather events, temperature shifts, or coastline changes resulting from climate change adversely impact crop yields for fruits and vegetables, our customers’ demand for our products may be reduced due to customers’ inability to make products that require packaging in the first instance. The Company is not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the effects of climate change. The impact of climate change may also vary by geographic location and other circumstances, including weather patterns and any impact to natural resources such as water. \nA number of governmental authorities both in the U.S. and abroad also have enacted, or are considering, legal requirements relating to environmental conservation and sustainability, energy efficiency deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and product stewardship, including mandating recycling, the use of recycled materials and/or limitations on certain kinds of packaging materials such as plastics. In addition, some companies with packaging needs have responded to such developments, and/or to perceived environmental concerns of consumers, by using containers made in whole or in part of recycled materials. Such developments may reduce the demand for some of the Company's products, and/or increase its costs.\nThe Company may experience significant negative effects to its business as a result of new federal, state or local taxes, increases to current taxes or other governmental regulations specifically targeted to decrease the consumption of certain types of beverages. \nPublic health and government officials have become increasingly concerned about the health consequences associated with over-consumption of certain types of beverages, such as sugar-sweetened beverages and including those sold by certain of the Company's significant customers. Possible new federal, state or local taxes, increases to current taxes or other governmental regulations specifically targeted to decrease the consumption of these beverages may significantly reduce demand for the beverages of the Company's customers, which could in turn affect demand of the Company's customers for the Company's products. For example, taxes on certain sugar-sweetened beverages and/or energy drinks have been enacted in France, the U.K., Poland, Portugal, Hungary, India and Saudi Arabia. Some state and local governments are also considering similar taxes, and several U.S. cities, including in California, Pennsylvania and Colorado, have enacted taxes on certain sugar-sweetened beverages. The imposition of such taxes may decrease the demand for certain soft drinks and beverages that the Company's customers produce, which may cause the Company's customers to respond by decreasing their purchases from the Company. Consumer tax legislation and future attempts to tax sugar-sweetened or energy drinks by other jurisdictions could reduce the demand for the Company's products and materially adversely affect the Company's business and financial results. \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nDemand for the Company's products could be affected by changes in laws and regulations applicable to food and beverages and changes in consumer preferences.\nThe Company manufactures and sells metal and glass packaging primarily for the beverage and food can market. As a result, many of the Company's products come into direct contact with beverages and food. Accordingly, the Company's products must comply with various laws and regulations for beverages and food applicable to its customers. Changes in such laws and regulations, such as the sugary-drink taxes discussed above, could negatively impact customers' demand for the Company's products as they comply with such changes and/or require the Company to make changes to its products. Such changes to the Company's products could include modifications to the coatings and compounds that the Company uses, possibly resulting in the incurrence of additional costs. Additionally, because many of the Company's products are used to package consumer goods, the Company is subject to a variety of risks that could influence consumer behavior and negatively impact demand for the Company's products, including changes in consumer preferences driven by various health-related concerns and perceptions. \nChanges in accounting standards, taxation requirements and other law could negatively affect the Company's financial results. \nNew accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to the Company from time to time, or changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements, could have a significant effect on the Company's reported results for the affected periods. The Company is also subject to income tax in the numerous jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Increases in income tax rates or other changes to tax laws could reduce the Company's after-tax income from affected jurisdictions or otherwise affect the Company's tax liability. \nIn addition, the Company's products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which it operates. Increases in indirect taxes could affect the Company's products' affordability and therefore reduce demand for its products. \nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe loss of a major customer and/or customer consolidation could reduce the Company's net sales and profitability. \nMany of the Company's largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the concentration of the Company's business with its largest customers. In many cases, such consolidation has been accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of product purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. Increased pricing pressures from the Company's customers may reduce the Company's net sales and net income. In addition, customer concentration could expose the Company to increased credit risk if large customers were unable to fulfill their payment obligations to the Company.\nThe majority of the Company's sales are to companies that have leading market positions in the sale of beverages, packaged food and household products to consumers. The loss of any major customers, a reduction in the purchasing levels of these customers or an adverse change in the terms of supply agreements with these customers could reduce the Company's net sales and net income. A continued consolidation of the Company's customers could exacerbate any such loss. In addition, the Company's relationship with several of its customers, particularly in Transit Packaging, is noncontractual, and as a result its customers may unilaterally reduce their purchases of its products.\nThe Company may not be able to manage its anticipated growth, and it may experience constraints or inefficiencies caused by unanticipated acceleration and deceleration of customer demand.\nUnanticipated acceleration and deceleration of customer demand for the Company's products may result in constraints or inefficiencies related to the Company's manufacturing, sales force, implementation resources and administrative infrastructure, particularly in emerging markets where the Company is seeking to expand production. Such constraints or inefficiencies may adversely affect the Company as a result of delays, lost potential product sales or loss of current or potential customers due to their dissatisfaction. Similarly, over-expansion, including as a result of overcapacity due to expansion by the Company's competitors, or investments in anticipation of growth that does not materialize, or develops more slowly than the Company expects, could harm the Company's financial results and result in overcapacity. \nTo manage the Company's anticipated future growth effectively, the Company must continue to enhance its manufacturing capabilities and operations, information technology infrastructure, and financial and accounting systems and controls. Organizational growth and scale-up of operations could strain its existing managerial, operational, financial and other resources. \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\nThe Company's growth requires significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of new products or enhancements of existing products or reduction of the Company's outstanding indebtedness. If the Company's management is unable to effectively manage the Company's growth, its expenses may increase more than expected, its revenue could grow more slowly than expected and it may not be able to achieve its research and development and production goals, any of which could have a material effect on its business, operating results or financial condition.\nAcquisitions, dispositions or investments that the Company is considering, has pursued or may pursue could be unsuccessful, consume significant resources and require the incurrence of additional indebtedness. \nThe Company has completed and may consider acquisitions and investments that complement its existing business or dispositions of portions of its existing business. The actual or potential acquisitions, dispositions and investments, such as the Company's divestiture of its European Tinplate business in August 2021, involve or may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence (including the incurrence of additional indebtedness under the Company's senior secured revolving credit facilities or other secured or unsecured debt), operating losses and expenses and the diversion of management's attention that could have a material effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results. \nIn particular, if the Company incurs additional debt in order to finance an acquisition, the Company's liquidity and financial stability could be impaired as a result of using a significant portion of available cash or borrowing capacity. Moreover, the Company may face an increase in interest expense or financial leverage if additional debt is incurred to finance an acquisition, which may, among other things, adversely affect the Company's various financial ratios and the Company's compliance with the conditions of its existing indebtedness. In addition, such additional indebtedness may be incurred under the Company's senior secured credit facilities or otherwise secured by liens on the Company's assets. \nAcquisitions and dispositions involve numerous other risks, including: \n•diversion of management time and attention; \n•failures to identify material problems and liabilities of acquisition targets or to obtain sufficient indemnification rights to fully offset possible liabilities related to the acquired businesses; \n•difficulties integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n•inefficiencies and complexities that may arise due to unfamiliarity with new assets, businesses or markets; \n•disruptions to the Company's ongoing business; \n•inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings; \n•the inability to obtain required financing for the new acquisition or investment opportunities and the Company's existing business; \n•the need or obligation to divest portions of an acquired business;\n•challenges associated with successfully bifurcating operations that involve both remaining and departing personnel in divestiture transactions; \n•challenges associated with operating in new geographic regions or discontinued operations in legacy regions;\n•difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects;\n•potential loss of key employees, contractual relationships, suppliers or customers of the acquired businesses or of the Company; and \n•inability to obtain required anti-trust and other regulatory approvals. \nTo the extent the Company pursues an acquisition or disposition that causes it to incur unexpected costs or that fails to generate expected returns, the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected, and the Company's ability to service its indebtedness may be negatively impacted. \nIf the Company fails to retain key management and personnel, the Company may be unable to implement its business plan. \nMembers of the Company's senior management have extensive industry experience, and it might be difficult to find new personnel with comparable experience. Because the Company's business is highly specialized, the Company believes that it would also be difficult to replace its key technical personnel. The Company believes that its future success depends, in large part, on its experienced senior management team. Losing the services of key members of its management team could limit the Company's ability to implement its business plan. In addition, under the Company's unfunded Senior Executive Retirement Plan \nCrown Holdings, Inc.\n\ncertain members of senior management are entitled to lump sum payments upon retirement or other termination of employment and a lump sum death benefit of five times the annual retirement benefit, which could result in unexpected increased costs to the Company for a particular period.\nThe Company relies on its information technology, and potential cyber-attack, data breach or other failure or disruption of its information technology could disrupt its operations and adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe Company's business increasingly relies on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. A significant portion of the communication between the Company's personnel around the world, customers, and suppliers depends on information technology. As with all large systems, the Company's information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. In addition, cybersecurity related risks including security breaches and cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, malicious code (including ransomware), social-engineering attacks (including phishing attacks) or other information security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of the Company’s confidential information. These threats also may be further enhanced in frequency or effectiveness through threat actors’ use of artificial intelligence.\nThe concentration of processes in shared services centers means that any disruption could impact a large portion of the Company's business within the operating zones served by the affected service center. If the Company does not allocate, and effectively manage, the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect the proper technology infrastructure, the Company could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual or physical property through security breach, and reputational harm, as well as potential litigation, civil liability and fines under various laws and regulatory regimes of jurisdictions in which the Company does business. While the Company has security measures in place designed to protect the integrity of customer information and prevent data loss, misappropriation, and other security breaches, the Company's information technology systems could nevertheless be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes (including for purposes of ransom demands or other forms of blackmail), particularly if the Company's information security training and compliance programs prove to be inadequate. In addition, if the Company's information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and the Company's business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, the Company may lose customers and suppliers and revenue and profits as a result of its inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments from its customers, and could experience delays in reporting its financial results, including with respect to the Company's operations in emerging markets. Furthermore, if the Company is unable to prevent security breaches, it may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to the Company or to its customers or suppliers, and it may suffer indirect economic loss if its existing insurance policies and coverage related to information security risks prove to be insufficient. Failure or disruption of the Company's information technology systems, or the back-up systems, for any reason could disrupt the Company's operations and negatively impact the Company's cash flows or financial condition. \nSentiment towards climate change, sustainability and other ESG matters could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company has announced sustainability goals for its next phase of Sustainability as part of its Twentyby30 program. Execution of this program and the achievements of the Company’s sustainability goals is subject to risk and uncertainties, many of which are out of the Company’s control. Failure to achieve these sustainability goals within the currently projected costs and expected timeframes could damage the Company’s reputation, customer and investor relationships, or ability to access capital on favorable terms, particularly given investors’ increased focus on ESG matters in recent years, and in turn could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. \nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control, the Company may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud. \nEffective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm the Company's business. The Company must annually evaluate its internal procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires management and auditors to assess the effectiveness of internal controls. If the Company fails to remedy or maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. \nCrown Holdings, Inc.",
