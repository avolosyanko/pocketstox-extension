      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nTractor Supply Company (the “Company” or “Tractor Supply” or “we” or “our” or “us”) is the largest rural lifestyle retailer in the United States (“U.S.”). The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers, ranchers, and all those who enjoy living the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the “Out Here” lifestyle).  We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Petsense by Tractor Supply. Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities. We also offer an expanded assortment of products through the Tractor Supply mobile application and online at TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com.\nThe Company has one reportable industry segment which is the retail sale of products that support the rural lifestyle. At December 28, 2024, we operated 2,502 retail stores in 49 states (2,296 Tractor Supply retail stores and 206 Petsense by Tractor Supply retail stores). Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of inside selling space, along with additional outside selling space (“Side Lot” or “Garden Centers”), and our Petsense by Tractor Supply stores have approximately 5,500 square feet of inside selling space. Our online selling websites and our mobile application offer an extended assortment of products beyond those offered in-store and drive traffic into our stores through our buy online and pickup in-store and ship to store programs. Our retail store locations and digital capabilities provide the convenience to allow our customers to engage with us anytime, anywhere and in any way they choose. \nBusiness Strategy for Tractor Supply Company \nWe believe our sales and earnings growth is the result of executing our multi-year strategy, which includes the following key components:\n\nTarget Market\nWe are dedicated to fulfilling the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers, ranchers, homesteaders, animal and pet owners, and all those who enjoy living the rural lifestyle. Our distinct approach differentiates us from other retailers by concentrating our product assortment on these core customers. We provide a convenient shopping experience both in-store and online, focusing on needs-based, demand-driven product categories. Serving the rural lifestyle market, we act as a trip consolidator for numerous basic maintenance requirements of farm, ranch, and rural customers.\nCustomers\nOur target customers are home, land, pet, animal and livestock owners who generally have above average income and below average cost of living. We seek to serve a customer base that primarily lives in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities. This customer base includes recreational farmers, ranchers, and all those who enjoy living a rural inspired lifestyle. \nCustomer Service\nWe are committed to providing our customers reliable product availability and a convenient, customer-centric experience across shopping channels. In our stores, we believe the ability of our motivated, well-trained team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps our customers find the right products to satisfy their everyday needs, as well as the specialty items needed to complete their rural lifestyle projects. We also engage with our customers through our e-commerce websites and mobile application, which provide the opportunity to allow customers to shop anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose, while delivering enhanced product information, research, and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas. Additionally, we maintain a Customer Solutions Center at our Store Support Center located in Brentwood, Tennessee, to support our in-store and online customers, as well as our store team members. We believe this commitment to customer service promotes strong customer loyalty through personalized experiences and provides convenience that our customers expect, which drives repeat shopping experiences. \nWe use a third-party provider to survey and measure our level of customer service.  This process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience.  Based on the third-party provider’s data, we believe our customer satisfaction scores are among the best-in-class.  We carefully evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at both the Company and the individual store level based on that feedback.\nStore Environment\nOur stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies.  Stores are strategically arranged to provide an open environment for optimal product placement and visual display. In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily reallocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions. Display and product placement information is routinely sent to stores to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores, and our Field Activity Support Teams (“FAST”) are dedicated to support the stores in creating an enhanced in-store experience for our customers through best-in-class merchandising execution. Our store layouts and visual displays are designed to provide our customers a feeling of familiarity and convenience to enhance the shopping experience. Informative signs are located in key product categories to conveniently assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.  These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing, useful information regarding product benefits, and suggestions for appropriate accessories. Also, our store team members wear highly visible red vests or aprons with name tags, and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located near the front of the store. Our stores have been equipped with tools such as team member communication devices, wireless internet, and mobile point-of-sale devices that enable our team members to provide an enhanced shopping experience to our customers. In addition, our buy online and pickup in-store and ship to store programs, including curbside pickup, provide convenient access for customers to pick up merchandise from our store locations. We also offer store delivery in all of our Tractor Supply stores to meet our customers' needs.\nWe are in the midst of a multi-year project that began in 2020 to remodel our existing store base, bringing programs to life with new fixtures, layouts and products that truly enhance the customer shopping experience. The site-level space is analyzed category by category and reallocated as needed to align with current merchandising strategies and to drive space productivity. Another space productivity initiative is to transform our Side Lot with an expanded product offering and an enhanced shopping experience. With this investment, the Side Lot space is leveraged to offer a wider product offering in the lawn and garden categories and new categories within the garden center, and offer greater convenience through the expansion of our buy online and pickup in-store and ship to store capabilities for drive-thru pickup.\nMerchandising and Purchasing\nWe offer an extensive assortment of products for all those seeking to enjoy the “Out Here” lifestyle.  Our product assortment is tailored to meet the needs of our customers in various geographic markets.  Our full line of product offerings includes a broad selection of high quality, reputable brand name and exclusive brand products with approximately 17,000 to 27,000 products per store as well as over 325,000 products online.  No single product accounted for more than 10% of our sales during fiscal 2024. Our comprehensive selection of merchandise is comprised of the following major product categories:\n•Livestock, Equine & Agriculture: livestock and equine feed & equipment, poultry, fencing, and sprayers & chemicals; \n•Companion Animal: food, treats and equipment for dogs, cats, and other small animals as well as dog wellness; \n•Seasonal & Recreation: tractor & rider, lawn & garden, bird feeding, power equipment, and other recreational products;\n•Truck, Tool, & Hardware: truck accessories, trailers, generators, lubricants, batteries, and hardware and tools; and\n•Clothing, Gift, & Décor: clothing, footwear, toys, snacks, and decorative merchandise.\nThe following table indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022:\n\n                                                                               Percent of Net Sales\n                                                                                        Fiscal Year\nProduct Category:                              2024                    2023                    2022\nLivestock, Equine &amp; Agriculture          26   %                  27   %                  28   %\nCompanion Animal                             25                      25                      23    \nSeasonal &amp; Recreation                    23                      22                      22    \nTruck, Tool, &amp; Hardware                  16                      16                      16    \nClothing, Gift, &amp; Décor                  10                      10                      11    \nTotal                                       100   %                 100   %                 100   %\nNote: Net sales by major product categories for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. \nOur buying team continuously reviews and updates our product assortment as necessary to respond to customer needs and to offer new, relevant products. We are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on consumable, usable, and edible (“C.U.E.”) products. Examples of C.U.E. product categories include, but are not limited to, livestock feed and bedding, pet food, bird seed, lubricants, propane, and various seasonal products, such as fertilizer, weed control, mulch, pest control, and twine. \nOur products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors, each of whom are expected to adhere to a code of conduct that guides our relationship.  Our business is not dependent upon any single vendor or particular group of vendors.  We purchase our products from a group of over 1,000 vendors, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2024.  Approximately 400 core vendors accounted for 90% of our merchandise purchases during fiscal 2024. We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products to meet customer demands despite the global supply chain disruptions and delays. We believe that adequate sources of supply exist, but they may cost more or require us to incur higher transportation costs.  \nOur buying teams focus on merchandise procurement, vendor line reviews, and testing of new products and programs.  We also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on forecasting and inventory replenishment, a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning, and a specialized pricing team that seeks to optimize market-specific pricing for our products. Through the combined efforts of these teams, we continue to focus on improving our overall inventory productivity and in-stock inventory position.\nIntellectual Property \nOur subsidiary, Tractor Supply Co. of Texas, LP (“TSCT”), owns registrations with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for various service marks including TSC®, Tractor Supply Co.®, TSC Tractor Supply Co.®, Petsense by Tractor Supply®, and the trapezium design for retail services. We consider these service marks, and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition, to be valuable assets of our business. TSCT also owns several other service marks for retail services, some of which have been registered with the USPTO and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO. \nIn addition to selling products that bear nationally-known manufacturer brands, we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business. These exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands, which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination retailer. \nOur exclusive brands represented approximately 29%, 29%, and 30% of our total sales in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. Our exclusive brands include:\n\n4health® (pet foods and supplies)                           Paws &amp; Claws® (pet foods and supplies)                     \nAmerican Farmworks® (livestock, farm and ranch              Producer’s Pride® (livestock and horse feed and supplies)      \nequipment)                                                                                                                 \nBit &amp; Bridle® (apparel and footwear)                    Red Shed® (gifts, collectibles, and outdoor furniture)         \nBlue Mountain® (apparel)                                    Redstone® (heating products)                                   \nC.E.

Our patents (both United States and foreign) have expiration dates ranging from April 5, 2027 to November 3, 2043 and protect various elements, designs or functions of farm and ranch equipment, as well as light systems for trucks and other vehicles. \nWe believe our intellectual property, which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above, together with certain trade names, domain names, patents, and copyrights, has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies. \nDistribution\nWe currently operate a distribution facility network for supplying stores with merchandise and delivering product ordered through our websites and mobile application. In fiscal 2024, our Tractor Supply stores received approximately 81% of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly from our vendors to our stores or customers. We believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise that allows us to be a dependable supplier to our customers for their “Out Here” lifestyle solutions by enhancing in-stock inventory positions, while minimizing freight expense and improving the inventory turn rate. Our distribution facilities, located in Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New York, Ohio and Texas represent a total distribution center capacity of approximately 7.8 million square feet. We also use third-party operated import centers, mixing centers and pop-up distribution facilities which provide additional distribution capacity. On May 14, 2024, the Company opened its tenth and largest distribution center located in Maumelle, Arkansas, which expanded the distribution center capacity by approximately 1.2 million square feet.\nWe select the locations of our distribution facilities in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution facilities to our stores. Our distribution centers utilize warehouse and labor management tools that support the planning, control, and processing of inventory. We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a transportation management system.  We utilize multiple common carriers for store and direct to customer \ndeliveries. We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, monitoring of transportation routes, and scheduling of deliveries.\nMarketing\nLeveraging our value-driving offerings from our Neighbor’s Club loyalty program, we utilize an “everyday low price” philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by limited and strategically planned promotions throughout the year. To drive store traffic, build brand consideration, and position ourselves as a destination retailer, we promote a broad selection of merchandise and our “Life Out Here” brand messaging through digital and social media initiatives, targeted digital video (connected TV and streaming programming), and e-mail.  In addition, our Neighbor’s Club loyalty program continues to drive strong customer count growth and enhances our ability to engage with our customers, recognize and reward our best customers, drive desired purchase behaviors, and create brand advocacy. Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions, additional funding, and honoring coupons. Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, support for in-store events, point-of-purchase materials for customer education, and product knowledge for our team members. \nDigital\nEnsuring that our customers can engage with us in the most convenient manner for them whether in our stores, on our website, on our mobile application, or via our Customer Solutions Center, is a high priority for us. Our goal is to be available anytime, anywhere, and in any way our customers choose to engage with our brand. We provide our customers the opportunity to shop in a manner that fits their lifestyle and is most convenient for them. Our focus is on delivering a comprehensive, easy shopping experience, offering the conveniences our customers want and expect by driving a personalized experience by leveraging our Neighbor’s Club Loyalty program. We offer buy online, pickup in-store, and curbside pickup, which provide convenient access for customers to pick up merchandise from our store locations. Additionally, our online experience offers an expansive product assortment including a direct to consumer assortment. This allows us to extend our aisles beyond our store locations and provides convenient and useful content that is relevant to our customers’ lifestyle. We provide our customers the ability to have products shipped directly to our retail store locations or delivered to their homes or offices. For select products, we offer same day delivery. We use our distribution facility network as well as our stores to support our e-commerce activities. Our digital commerce (“Digital”) capabilities have further enhanced our in-store shopping experience, allowing us to engage with our customers more effectively, and expanded our target markets outside of our current retail store locations.\nContinuous Improvement\nWe are committed to a continuous improvement program to drive change throughout our organization. Using data analytics and team member engagement, we examine business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs, drive innovation, and improve effectiveness. We establish annual goals for productivity and cost improvement. Additionally, we have training goals to expand our team’s knowledge and understanding of continuous improvement, which is a key pillar in our culture. We have implemented several continuous improvement projects, with team members across our business, to evaluate key operations and implement process changes. Team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes. Management encourages the participation of all team members in the decision-making process, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members, and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.\nManagement Information and Control Systems\nWe have invested resources in management information and control systems to provide legendary customer service and to deliver the right products in the right place at the right time. This investment includes use of digital technologies that support the “Out Here” lifestyle and integrate the customer experience in-store, online, and through our Customer Solutions Center, which offers customers the ability to shop anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose. Our key platforms include:\n•Point-of-sale system;\n•In-store mobility;\n•E-commerce platform;\n•Consumer mobile app;\n•Replenishment and allocation systems;\n•Merchandising presentation and inventory management tools;\n•Warehouse and transportation management systems; \n•Labor management tools for stores and supply chain;\n•Price optimization system;\n•Vendor purchase order control system;\n•Human resource information systems;\n•Business intelligence and analytics tools; and \n•Customer loyalty and campaign management system. \nThese systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.\nWe continue to invest in technology to support store, online, and distribution facility expansion and our long-term strategic growth initiatives focused heavily on improving the customer experience across all channels. We also continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness.  Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes, and upgrades to support optimal software configurations, and application performance. We plan to continue to invest in information technology and implement efficiency-driving system enhancements such as computer vision, labor and task management tools, edge computing and artificial intelligence. We will continue to evaluate the use of emerging technologies to improve productivity such as robotics, robotic process automation, quantum computing and other technologies. We also maintain and continue to strengthen the security of our information systems to help protect and prevent unauthorized access to personal information of our customers, team members, vendors, and other confidential Company data. We are endeavoring to adhere to quickly evolving industry privacy laws and standards, as well as governance as it applies to artificial intelligence. Critical areas of focus include cloud, end point protection and privacy. Collectively, these efforts are directed toward improving business processes, maintaining secure, efficient, and stable systems, and enabling the continued growth and success of our business.\nPetsense by Tractor Supply\nPetsense by Tractor Supply is a small-box pet specialty supply retailer focused on meeting the needs of pet owners, primarily in small and mid-sized communities, and offering a variety of pet products and services. At December 28, 2024, we operated a total of 206 Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in 23 states, and an e-commerce website (Petsense.com). The Petsense name is registered with the USPTO.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe that our team members are the foundation of our business and that their hard work, passion, commitment, and experience drive our success. As a result of our commitment to our team members, we have been recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as a “Great Place to Work-Certified” company for five consecutive years. Additionally, we earned a spot on both the Nashville Business Journal's Best Places to Work (2023) and The Tennessean's Top Workplaces in Middle Tennessee (2023) lists, as well as national lists including Fortune’s Best Workplaces in Retail (2023), Newsweek’s America's Greatest Workplaces (2023), and Forbes’ America's Best Large Employers (2023). Below are further descriptions of our Company and our focus on the development and support of our team members:\nManagement and Team Members\nAs of December 28, 2024, we employed approximately 26,000 full-time and 26,000 part-time Tractor Supply and Petsense by Tractor Supply team members and use contractors on an as-needed basis. We typically employ additional part-time team members throughout the year during high sales volume periods. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.\nEligible team members participate in one of our various bonus incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon individual, team, and/or Company performance. In addition to bonus incentive programs, we provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan. We offer health insurance for which we share a significant portion of the cost of premiums. We additionally provide our eligible team members with a tuition reimbursement program, paid time off and a six-week parental leave policy for new parents. Our team members also receive a discount on merchandise purchased from the Company. \nWe encourage a promote-from-within environment when internal resources permit. We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to prepare our high-potential team members for greater responsibility. Our current team of district managers and store managers has an average tenure of approximately ten and seven years, respectively. We believe internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, provide the management structure necessary to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives. \nStore Team Member Learning & Development\nWe seek to hire store team members who live and appreciate the “Out Here” lifestyle, including recreational farmers, ranchers, homesteaders, animal and pet owners, and all those who enjoy living the rural lifestyle. We endeavor to staff our stores with courteous, highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members, often in cooperation with our vendors. Our learning & development programs include:\n•A thorough on-boarding process to prepare new team members for their new role;\n•Productive workplace environment training that is intended to educate team members on Company policies and procedures covering topics such as harassment, discrimination, and retaliation\n•New store opening training that prepares our store managers to open new stores to Company standards;\n•A management training program which covers all aspects of our store operations, including delivering superior service and managing the team member experience;\n•Structured training on customer service and selling skills;\n•Online product knowledge training produced in conjunction with key vendors;\n•Leadership development programs that prepare leaders to expand their current contributions;\n•Periodic all store team member meetings; and\n•An annual store manager meeting with vendor product presentations.\nWorkplace Health and Safety\nAt Tractor Supply, maintaining a healthy, safe environment for our team members and customers is embedded in our mission and values. Team members are empowered to do the “right thing” and encourage the same of others. We are committed to driving a culture of safety for our team members, customers and communities through role-based training specific to Tractor Supply’s operations, the use of technology to deliver training, and an attitude of continual improvement.\nRespectful Workplace Initiatives\nAt Tractor Supply, we foster a safe, dynamic and productive work environment free of discrimination, harassment and retaliation, supported by our Mission and Values, where everyone is treated with respect and which fosters different perspectives, ideas and innovative thinking. Our Mission and Values have been the foundation of our culture for more than 85 years. All of our team members and customers are highly valued, and we place high importance on considering different viewpoints and caring for and supporting one another.\nGrowth Strategy\nTractor Supply believes we can grow our business by being an integral part of our customers’ lives as the dependable supplier of “Out Here” lifestyle solutions, creating customer loyalty through personalized experiences, our Neighbor's Club loyalty program and providing convenience that our customers expect at anytime, anywhere, and in any way they choose. Our long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand and deepen our customer base by providing personal, localized, and memorable customer engagements by leveraging content, social media, and digital shopping experiences, attracting new customers and driving loyalty, (2) evolve customer experiences by digitizing our business processes and furthering our Digital capabilities, (3) offer relevant assortments and services across all channels through exclusive and national brands and continue to grow our total addressable market by introducing new products and services through our test and learn strategy, (4) drive operational excellence and productivity through continuous improvement, increasing space utilization, and implementing advanced supply chain capabilities to support growth, scale and agility, and (5) expand through selective acquisitions, as such opportunities arise, to add complementary businesses and to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to supplement organic growth.\nAchieving this strategy will require a foundational focus on: (1) connecting, empowering and growing our team to enhance our team members' lives and the communities in which they live, enabling them to provide legendary service to our customers, and (2) allocating resources in a disciplined and efficient manner to drive profitable growth and build stockholder value, including leveraging technology and automation, to align our cost structure to support new business capabilities for margin improvement and cost reductions.\nOver the past five years, we have experienced considerable sales growth, resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.2%. We plan to open approximately 90 new Tractor Supply and approximately 10 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores in fiscal 2025, a selling square footage increase of approximately 4%. In fiscal 2024, we opened 80 new Tractor Supply stores and 11 new Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. In fiscal 2023, we opened 70 new Tractor Supply stores and 13 \nnew Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. This represents a selling square footage increase of approximately 2% during fiscal 2024 and 3% during fiscal 2023. \nAt December 28, 2024, we operated 2,502 retail stores in 49 states (2,296 Tractor Supply retail stores and 206 Petsense by Tractor Supply retail stores). Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets. We believe we have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have significant additional opportunities for new Tractor Supply stores. We also believe that there is opportunity for continued growth for Petsense by Tractor Supply stores. \nApproximately 61% of our stores are in freestanding buildings and 39% are located in shopping centers. We lease approximately 96% of our stores and own the remaining 4%.\nIn addition to new store expansion, we will continue to support our strategic growth through expansion of our distribution network and initiatives including, among others, space productivity and Side Lot improvements to include Garden Centers in certain existing stores as well as continued improvements in technology and infrastructure at our existing stores, and ongoing investments to enhance our Digital capabilities to better serve our customers.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a competitive retail industry. We believe the principal competitive factors include location of stores, fulfillment options, price, quality of merchandise, in-stock inventory consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, product knowledge, and customer service. We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, pet retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.  However, we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle. See further discussion of competition in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeasonality and Weather\nOur business is seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. We usually experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season, and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold-weather selling season. We believe that our business can be more accurately assessed by focusing on the performance of the halves, not the quarters, due to the fact that different weather patterns from year-to-year can shift the timing of sales and profits between quarters, particularly between the first and second fiscal quarters and the third and fourth fiscal quarters. \nHistorically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have unfavorably affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations. In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain, and droughts have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and duration of these conditions. See further discussion in Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Weather and Climate Risks” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends. \nStewardship and Compliance with Environmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, enacted or adopted to protect the environment. We are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. We are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company, including through promoting land and water conservation efforts. This commitment is demonstrated through our Stewardship Program, which is comprised of environmental and sustainability-related initiatives designed to lessen our environmental footprint. These include the installation of energy management systems, LED lighting conversion, high efficiency heating/air conditioning systems; recycling programs in our stores, distribution centers and Store Support Center; and the installation of rooftop solar arrays at the Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee, our Tractor Supply store in Hendersonville, Tennessee and our newest distribution centers in Navarre, Ohio and Maumelle, Arkansas. \nWe continue to invest in sustainable buildings with the design, construction and operation of facilities that meet LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards. Our Store Support Center and distribution centers in Casa \nGrande, Arizona, and Frankfort, New York are all LEED Silver certified. Our Navarre, Ohio distribution center is the first Tractor Supply facility LEED Gold certified, and we expect our Maumelle, Arkansas distribution center to receive LEED Gold certification in 2025. The facilities each feature a rooftop solar array consisting of more than 10,000 solar panels that will produce five megawatts of electricity per year, which is enough energy to power the electricity needs of the building as well as electric fork trucks powered by lithium-ion batteries to move inventory within the facility.\nThe Company has been a SmartWay Transport partner since 2013. SmartWay Transport is a public-private initiative between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, large and small trucking companies, retailers, and other federal and state agencies. Its purpose is to improve fuel efficiency and the environmental performance of supply chains by way of reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.\nIn 2021, we set decarbonization goals meant to reduce absolute emissions from our operational footprint. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we submitted our letter of commitment to the Science Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”), outlining our intent to set a science-based target for climate goals. We have until the fall of 2025 to submit our proposed targets for validation. We will use the time to define our targets, develop decarbonization roadmaps, and create financial models to assess the effort needed to achieve these SBTs. These factors will guide our next steps. \nIn mid-2024, we made the decision to retire our 2021 GHG emissions reduction goals and focus on land and water initiatives as we thoughtfully analyze a science-based climate goal under SBTi. Understanding we have a responsibility to be respectful of the resources we consume, we are focused on making our operations as efficient as possible. We continually look for opportunities to drive efficiency by systematically replacing aging HVAC units, updating old fluorescent lighting with LED lighting, investing renewable energy sources like solar and wind and strategically purchasing renewable energy credits. Our commitment to publicly disclose our climate-related data remains strong. The company discloses information regarding Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, including disclosure of Scope 3 emissions by category as presented in our 2023 TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) Report, which can be found on our website (TractorSupply.com).\nIn addition, we announced an ambitious three-year goal in April of 2022 to conserve 25 million gallons of water by 2025. Through operational improvements and partnerships with Ducks Unlimited and Trout Unlimited, we have already begun to make significant progress towards achieving our goal. These partnerships are designed to make a positive impact on nature by supporting work to restore sensitive habitats that are so important to Life Out Here. These commitments to climate and society reinforce Tractor Supply’s vision that a healthy environment, properly managed resources, and vibrant communities are all key for a secure and prosperous future. \nInformation about our Executive Officers\nPursuant to General Instruction G(3) of Form 10-K, the following list is included in Part I of this Report in lieu of being included in the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 15, 2025.\nThe following is a list of the names and ages of all executive officers of the registrant, indicating all positions and offices with the registrant held by each such person and each person’s principal occupations and employment during at least the past five years:\n\nName                          Position                                                                                        Age\nHarry A.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. Certain risks of which we are currently aware and deem to be material are described below.  If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may significantly suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.  These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStrategic and Competitive Risks\nFailure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name or any of our exclusive brands.\nOur success depends in part on the value and strength of the Tractor Supply name, including our exclusive brands. The Tractor Supply name is integral to our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent, high quality customer experience. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity, whether or not based on fact. Any failure to comply or accusation of our failure to comply with data privacy, environmental, ethical, labor, product, social, and other regulatory and industry standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions. Customers are also increasingly using social media to provide feedback and information about our Company, including our products and services, in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. We have been, and in the future may be, subject to criticism in the media and on social media regarding our company and management, as well as our stewardship strategies and changes in those strategies, which may be considered to be overreaching by some stakeholders and inadequate by other stakeholders. Widespread dissemination of such criticism at times has impacted our relationships with our customers and investors, and may do so in the future. Further, adverse publicity about our merchandise products or company, whether valid or not, may discourage customers from buying the products we offer. Additionally, our proprietary rights in our trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business. We may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names, such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own. Any of these events could result in decreased revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unable to increase sales at our existing stores.\nWe experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales at our existing stores, defined as sales in stores which have been open for at least twelve months. See Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for a further discussion of comparable store sales. Various factors affect the comparable store sales at our existing stores, including, among others, the general retail sales environment, our ability to efficiently source and distribute products, global supply chain disruptions, changes in our merchandise assortment, competition, proximity of our locations to one another or to the locations of other competing retailers, increased presence of online retailers, current economic conditions, customer satisfaction with our products, retail pricing, the timing of promotional events, the release of new merchandise, the success of marketing programs, weather conditions, and our ability to attract and retain qualified team members.  These factors may cause the comparable store sales results at our existing stores to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations.  Past comparable store sales are not an indication of future results, and there can be no assurance that our comparable store sales will not decrease in the future.\nOur merchandising and marketing initiatives may not provide expected results.\nWe believe our past performance has been based upon, and future success will depend in part upon, the ability to develop and execute merchandising initiatives with effective marketing programs.  These merchandising initiatives and marketing programs may not deliver expected results, and there is no assurance that we will correctly identify and respond in a timely manner to evolving trends and consumer preferences and expectations. If we misjudge the market or our marketing programs are not successful, we may overstock unpopular products and be forced to take inventory impairment or retail price reductions that have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Failure to execute and promote such initiatives in a timely manner could harm our ability to grow the business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Shortages of key merchandise could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer needs, expectations, or trends, which could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics; consumer preferences, expectations and needs; and unexpected weather conditions, public health issues (including pandemics and quarantines and related shut-downs, re-openings, or other actions by the government) or natural disasters, while also managing appropriate inventory levels in our stores and distribution or fulfillment centers and managing an excellent customer experience. It is difficult to successfully predict the products and services our customer will demand. As our customers begin to expect a more personalized experience, our ability to collect, use, and protect relevant customer data is important to our ability to effectively meet their expectations. Our ability to collect and use that data, however, is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security. In addition, each of our primary customer groups has different needs and expectations, many of which evolve as the demographics in a particular customer group change. We also need to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group. If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers.\nCustomer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also becoming more demanding. Customers routinely use technology and a variety of electronic devices and digital platforms to rapidly compare products and prices, read product reviews, determine real-time product availability, and purchase products. Once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products, and they often expect quick, timely, and low-price or free delivery and/or convenient pickup options. We must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process.\nIn addition, a greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment or curbside pickup could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-selling of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our overall sales and adversely affect our financial performance.\nFailure to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs; to maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives and convenient pickup options; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment; and to ensure we have the correct processes and framework to monitor other necessary changes so we may continue to respond in a timely manner could adversely affect our relationship with customers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\nFailure to open and manage new stores in the number and manner currently contemplated could adversely affect our financial performance.\nAn integral part of our business strategy includes the expansion of our store base through new store openings. This expansion strategy is dependent on our ability to find suitable locations, and we face competition from many retailers and other businesses for such sites. If we are unable to implement this strategy, our ability to increase our sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired. To the extent that we are unable to open new stores in the manner we anticipate (due to, among other reasons, site approval or unforeseen delays in construction), our sales growth may be impeded.\nAlthough we have a rigorous real estate site selection and approval process, there can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in incremental sales and profitability for the Company. New stores build their sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our more mature stores. As we continue to open new stores, there may be a negative impact on our results from a lower contribution margin of these new stores until their sales levels ramp to chain average, if at all, as well as from the impact of related pre-opening costs. Additionally, new stores can also impact the sales and contribution margins of existing stores located in close proximity. \nAs we execute this expansion strategy, we may also experience managerial or operational challenges which may prevent any expected increase in sales, profitability, or cash flow. Our ability to manage our planned expansion depends on the adequacy of our existing information systems, the efficiency and expansion of our distribution systems, the adequacy of the hiring and training process for new personnel (especially store managers), the effectiveness of our controls and procedures, and the ability to identify customer demand and build market awareness in different geographic areas. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our planned expansion, that the new stores will be effectively integrated into our existing operations or that such stores will be profitable.\nCompetition may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.\nWe operate in the highly competitive retail merchandise sector with numerous competitors. These competitors include general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, pet retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently-owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains, and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers. We compete for customers, merchandise, real estate locations, and team members. This competitive environment subjects us to various other risks, including the inability to continue our store and sales growth and to provide attractive merchandise to our customers at competitive prices that allow us to maintain our profitability. Our failure to compete effectively in this environment could adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions and the failure of an acquisition to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may, from time to time, acquire businesses we believe to be complementary to our business, such as the acquisition of Allivet, Inc. (“Allivet”) in December 2024. The success of an acquisition is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration, and other factors relating to the target business. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfully integrate an organization that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations, and general operating procedures. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions, we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, acquired businesses may not achieve desired profitability objectives or other expectations, causing lower than expected earnings and cash flows which could adversely affect our financial performance and subsequently require impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets.\nWeather and Climate Risks\nUnseasonal and extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, and climate change may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWeather conditions affect the demand for, timing of demand for, and in some cases the supply of, products, which in turn has an impact on prices.  Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and \nunseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations. In addition, extreme weather conditions, such as more frequent or intense hurricanes and tropical storms, thunderstorms, tornadoes, flood, fires, droughts, earthquakes, and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels, have impacted operating results both positively and negatively and may positively or negatively impact our business in the future. While extreme weather conditions can positively impact our operating results by increasing demand in affected locations for products needed to cope with the weather condition and its effects, they can also negatively affect our business depending on the severity and length of these conditions, as a result of store closings, damage to our stores or merchandise, or the inability of customers to shop at our stores due to weather conditions. Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends. Should such a strategy not be effective, the weather may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \nFurthermore, the long-term impacts of climate change, whether involving physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) or transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes, including the risk of diverging regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions) are expected to be widespread and unpredictable. These changes over time could affect, for example, consumer behavior and preferences, the availability and cost of certain consumer products and commodities, and energy (including utilities), which, in turn, may impact our ability to procure certain goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we or our customers require.\nAs a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWeather conditions may cause a disruption in our distribution and transportation network that would adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations.\nWe rely on our distribution and transportation network, including third-party logistics providers, to provide goods to our stores and to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores or customers by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, air, rail, and truck. Although we believe that our operations are efficient, disruptions due to extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme rain, fires and droughts have at times resulted and may in the future result in delays in the transportation and delivery of merchandise to our distribution centers, our stores, or our customers. Significant disruptions or delays in our distribution and transportation network could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our customers which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by legal, regulatory or market responses to global climate change. \nGrowing concern over climate change has led policy makers in the U.S. and elsewhere to consider the enactment of legislative and regulatory proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions. Such laws, if enacted, are likely to impact our business in a number of ways. For example, we use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in conducting our operations. Increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs, which could materially affect our profitability. We may also be subject to additional and more complex reporting requirements in the future. For example, the State of California recently amended the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act that will impose broad climate-related disclosure obligations on companies doing business in California. The SEC adopted climate change disclosure rules that have been stayed pending completion of judicial review. If enacted, the disclosure rules could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and complexity. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or requirements, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers. In addition, regulatory uncertainty, changes in applicable rules and regulations, and regulations in different jurisdictions that may conflict with each other may make compliance more costly or difficult to achieve. Our inability to appropriately respond to such changes could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, we could suffer adverse reputational impacts if we are not able to respond to any new regulatory or market changes in a timely fashion, on the same timeline as our peers, or at all.\nOur investors, other stakeholders, and regulators may not be satisfied with our ESG efforts including DE&I.\nIn July 2024, we announced a change in our goals relating to our carbon emissions goals and DE&I efforts. Our stakeholders may not be satisfied with our efforts or the changes in our goals, which could adversely affect public perception of our business, team member morale, customer or stockholder support as well as business and/or financial performance. For example, certain of our investors, as well as shareholder advocates, are placing an emphasis on how corporations address ESG including DE&I issues in their business strategy when making investment decisions and when developing their investment theses and proxy recommendations. Additionally, certain stock indices consider ESG factors in determining which companies qualify for inclusion. If our investors, shareholder advocates, or indices in which we are included react negatively to the changes in our goals, it could have a negative impact on our stock price. Future changes to our ESG goals and strategies may further adversely impact our relationship with our team members, customers, stockholders, and other stakeholders, which could result in a reduction in sales, a negative impact on our stock price, and erosion of stockholder trust. In addition, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, including potential enforcement action, if any of our regulators has a negative reaction to the changes in our goals or perceives our goals to conflict with regulatory requirements. \nMacroeconomic Risks\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. A weakening of economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as lower employment levels, uncertainty, instability or changes in business or political conditions, social and political causes and movements, including government shutdowns, changes in interest rates, inflation/deflation, higher tax rates, higher fuel and energy costs, higher labor and healthcare costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of terrorism, general health epidemics or pandemics, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to competitors. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending, shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors or shifts in discretionary spending to less profitable products sold by us could result in lower net sales, slower inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins.\nPurchase price volatility, including inflationary and deflationary pressures, may adversely affect our financial performance.\nAlthough we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both.  We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, grain, corn, steel, petroleum, cotton, and other commodities, as well as duties, tariffs, diesel fuel, and transportation services.  Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin.  Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices, and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors while maintaining product quality.  Should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility be ineffective, our financial performance could be adversely impacted.\nTeam Member Risks\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified team members, increases in wage, and labor costs, and changes in laws and other labor issues could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to maintain and continue expanding operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members.  Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling wage and related labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force, unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, increases in legally required minimum wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs, changes in employment legislation and the potential for changes in local labor practices or union activities.  If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or if costs of labor or related costs increase significantly, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions. These laws cover wage and hour practices, labor relations, paid and family leave, workplace safety and immigration, among others.  The laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level create unique challenges for a multi-state employer.  We must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various laws and regulations.  If our costs of labor or related costs increase significantly as new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nThe loss of current members of our senior management team and other key team members or the failure to successfully manage an executive officer transition may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success depends in large part on the continued availability and service of our executive officers, senior management, and other key team members. Competition for senior management and key team members in our industry is strong and we may not be able to retain our key team members or attract new qualified team members. We must continue to recruit, retain, and motivate management and other team members sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our long-term strategic growth initiatives. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management without sufficient advance notice could prevent or delay the implementation and completion of our strategic initiatives or divert management’s attention to seeking qualified replacements. Additionally, any failure by us to manage a successful leadership transition of an executive officer and to timely identify a qualified permanent replacement could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSupply Chain and Third-Party Vendor Risks\nWe face risks associated with vendors from whom our products are sourced.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international vendors.  We have agreements with our vendors in which the vendors agree to comply with applicable laws, including labor and environmental laws, and to indemnify us against certain liabilities and costs.  Our ability to recover liabilities and costs under these vendor agreements is dependent upon the financial condition and integrity of the vendors. We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but have no significant long-term contracts with such suppliers.  Our future success will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain our existing supplier relationships or to develop new ones.  This reliance exposes us to the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to political, economic, social, global health, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, or changes in laws and regulations affecting distribution, including the imposition of higher tariffs or other changes in trade policies. Our vendors may be forced to reduce their production, shut down their operations or file for bankruptcy protection, which could make it difficult for us to serve the market’s needs and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWhile the Company selects these third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions or the components or manufacture of their products. Any problems caused by these third-parties, or issues associated with their products or workforce, including customer or governmental complaints, breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, and cyber-attacks or security breaches at a vendor could subject the Company to litigation and adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell.  In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources.  As an importer, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business internationally, such as domestic and foreign governmental regulations, economic disruptions, global or regional health epidemics, delays in shipments, transportation capacity and costs, currency exchange rates, and changes in political or economic conditions in countries from which we purchase products.  If any such factors were to render the conduct of business in particular countries undesirable or impractical or if additional U.S. quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes, or other charges or restrictions were imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe political landscape in the U.S. contains uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries. We source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the U.S., primarily in Asia and Central America. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise, the imposition of tariffs on imported products or retaliatory actions by countries affected by changes in U.S. tax and trade policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely on manufacturers located in foreign countries, including China, for merchandise. Additionally, a portion of our domestically purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. Our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade, including the impact of current or potential tariffs by the U.S. with respect to certain consumer goods imported from China.\nWe source a portion of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside the U.S., primarily in Asia and Central America, and many of our domestic vendors have a global supply chain. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S. from China and could propose additional tariffs. The imposition of tariffs on imported products has increased our costs and could result in reduced sales and profits. The changes in certain tax and trade policies, tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries enacted under the prior U.S. administration increased the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the U.S., which represents a large percentage of our overall merchandise. It remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs or trade relations may change under the current U.S. administration, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity and net income.\nIn addition, the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. has resulted in the adoption of tariffs by China on U.S. exports and could result in the adoption of tariffs by other countries as well. A resulting trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. Further, the imposition of tariffs or other changes in world trade could have an impact on certain U.S. industries and consumers and could negatively impact the consumer demand for products that we sell.\nThrough our enterprise risk management, we continue to evaluate the impact of the effective and potential tariffs on our supply chain, costs, sales, and profitability as well as our strategies to mitigate any negative impact, including negotiating with our vendors, seeking alternative sourcing options, and adjusting retail selling prices. Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of the current and potential tariffs, as well as the potential for additional trade actions by the U.S. or other countries, the impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition is uncertain but could be significant. Thus, we can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful in whole or in part. To the extent that our supply chain, costs, sales, or profitability are negatively affected by the tariffs or other trade actions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nA significant disruption to our distribution network or to the timely receipt of inventory could adversely impact sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profits. \nWe rely on our distribution and transportation network, including third-party logistics providers, to provide goods to our stores in a timely and cost-effective manner through deliveries to our distribution facilities from vendors and then from the distribution facilities or direct ship vendors to our stores or customers by various means of transportation, including shipments by sea, air, rail, and truck. Any disruption, unanticipated expense, or operational failure related to this process could negatively affect our operations. For example, unexpected delivery delays (including delays due to weather, fuel shortages, work stoppages, global or regional health epidemics, product shortages from vendors, or other reasons) or increases in transportation costs (including increased fuel costs or a decrease in transportation capacity for overseas shipments) could significantly decrease our ability to provide adequate products to meet increased customer demand for certain products, or products at a desired price, resulting in lower sales and profitability. In addition, labor shortages or work stoppages in the transportation industry or long-term disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure that lead to delays or interruptions of deliveries could negatively affect our business. Also, a fire, tornado, or other disaster at one of our distribution facilities could disrupt our timely receiving, processing, and shipment of merchandise to our stores which could adversely affect our business. While we believe there are adequate reserve quantities and alternative suppliers available, shortages or interruptions in the receipt or supply of products caused by unanticipated demand, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, problems in production or distribution, financial or other difficulties of supplies, inclement weather or other economic conditions, including the availability of qualified drivers and distribution center team members, could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of products, and our operating results. \nThe implementation of our supply chain initiatives could disrupt our operations in the near term, and these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.\nWe maintain a network of distribution facilities and have plans to build new distribution facilities and expand existing facilities to support our long-term strategic growth initiatives. Delays in opening new or expanded distribution facilities could adversely affect our future operations by slowing store growth or negatively impacting our fulfillment capabilities, which may in turn reduce revenue growth. In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials; shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental, or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases. The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial \nexpectations due to construction-related or other reasons. We cannot guarantee that all projects will be completed on time or within established budgets. \nWe continue to make significant technology investments in our supply chain. These initiatives are designed to streamline our distribution process so that we can optimize the delivery of goods and services to our stores, distribution facilities, and customers in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of these initiatives, including those associated with managing third-party service providers and employing new web-based tools and services, could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the near term. In addition, our improved supply chain technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits, or the initiatives might fail altogether.\nTechnology, Data Security, Cybersecurity, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Risks\nAny failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, team members, and vendors that we hold, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks or otherwise, could damage our reputation with customers, team members, and vendors. Such a failure could also cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation, and could materially affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. \nWe depend on information systems and technology, some of which are managed or provided by third-parties, for many activities important to our business. As do most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems certain personal and other sensitive information about our business, customers, team members, and vendors. Additionally, we also receive and process information permitting cashless payments as part of our in-store and online operations at TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com and on our mobile application, some of which depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. The information that we receive and store makes us subject to cybersecurity attacks and cyber incidents, which are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated, and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. We are the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and we continuously monitor our information technology networks and infrastructure in an effort to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. While we have enhanced our cybersecurity processes and procedures in response to the general cybersecurity threat environment in recent years, we are not aware of any discrete cybersecurity threat, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, these security measures cannot provide absolute assurance or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing, detecting, or responding to every such breach or disruption and/or preventing the misuse of confidential information of our business, customers, team members, or vendors. Similar risks exist with respect to the third-party vendors on which we rely for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. \nA compromise of our information security and privacy controls, or those of businesses and vendors with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, or used by unauthorized or improper parties; loss or unavailability of data; disruptions to our business activities; or any other outcome stemming from a cybersecurity incident could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, team members, and vendors, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, and could result in significant legal and financial exposure beyond the scope or limits of insurance coverage. Moreover, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources to respond to the attack or breach and could result in a disruption of our operations.\nIn addition, states and the federal government have enacted laws and regulations relating to privacy, data breaches, and theft of team member and customer data.  These laws have increased the costs of doing business and, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations to implement appropriate safeguards or to detect and provide prompt notice of unauthorized access as required by some of these new laws, we could be subject to potential claims for damages and other remedies, which could harm our business. \nWe are subject to payments-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud, subject us to potential liability, and potentially disrupt our business.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit cards, debit cards, credit accounts, our private label credit cards, gift cards, direct debit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, and physical bank checks, and we may offer different payment options over time. These payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers, and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of \nthese payment systems. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards and promotional financing, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, adequately encrypt payment transaction data, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business and operations could suffer material losses in the event of system interruptions or failures.\nOur information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services managed or provided by third-parties, serve an important role in the operation and administration of our business. These systems are vulnerable to damages from any number of sources, including, but not limited to, human error, cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, fire, flood, power outages, telecommunication failures, facility or equipment damage, natural disasters, terrorism, and war.  In addition, we continually make investments in technology to implement new processes and systems, as well as to maintain and update our existing processes and systems. Implementing process and system changes increases the risk of disruption. If our information technology systems are interrupted or fail and our redundant systems or recovery plans are not adequate to address such interruptions or failures on a timely basis, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected.  Additionally, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.\nCustomer-facing technology systems are an important part of our sales and marketing strategy and the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences.\nThrough our continued information technology enhancements, including the use of artificial intelligence, we believe we are able to provide an improved overall shopping environment and a Digital experience that empowers our customers to shop and interact with us from computers, tablets, smart phones, and other mobile communication devices. We use our websites, TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com, and our mobile application as both a sales channel for our products and as a method of providing product, project, and other relevant information to our customers to drive in-store and online sales. Digital retailing is continually evolving and expanding, and we must effectively respond to changing customer expectations and new developments. The portion of total consumer expenditures with retailers occurring online and through mobile applications has continued to increase. The pace of this increase could further accelerate in the future. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Digital retailing is rapidly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. Our customers are increasingly using mobile phones, tablets, computers, and other devices to shop and to interact with us through social media. We are making investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Disruptions, failures, or other performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, including any artificial intelligence or machine learning systems we use now or may use in the future, could impair the benefits that they provide to our in-store and online business and negatively affect our relationship with our customers.\nIf we are unable to maintain or upgrade our management information systems and software programs or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient and our long-term strategic growth initiatives may not be successful.\nWe depend on management information systems for many aspects of our business.  We rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business. We could be materially adversely affected if we experienced a disruption or data loss relating to our management information systems and are unable to recover timely. We could also be adversely impacted if we are unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our management information systems, particularly in light of the contemplated continued store growth.\nThe success of our long-term strategic growth initiatives designed to increase our sales and improve margin are dependent in varying degrees on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology systems to support them.  Extended delays or cost overruns in securing, developing, and otherwise implementing technology solutions to support the long-term strategic growth initiatives would delay and possibly even prevent us from realizing the projected benefits of those initiatives. \nIn addition, our competitive position could be adversely affected if our competitors adopt, implement, or scale the use of emerging technologies before we are able to successfully do so.\nFinancial Risks\nChanges in market conditions or in our credit rating could restrict capital and adversely affect our business operations and growth initiatives.\nWe rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations, growth strategy, capital expenditures, and return of cash to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. Our continued access to liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and credit ratings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and/or improve our current credit ratings. A rating organization may lower our rating, or change our ratings’ outlook, or decide not to rate our securities, temporarily or permanently, in its sole discretion. In the event that our current credit ratings are downgraded or removed, we would most likely incur higher borrowing costs and experience greater difficulty in obtaining additional financing, which in turn would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We can make no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt and equity markets will not be adversely affected by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings.\nIn addition, tight lending practices may make it difficult for our real estate developers to obtain financing under acceptable loan terms and conditions.  Unfavorable lending conditions could impact the timing of our store openings and materially adversely affect our ability to open new stores in desirable locations.\nLonger-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced funding alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business.  Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.  Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, cash dividends, or other discretionary uses of cash.\nOur level of indebtedness could limit our cash flow available for operations and could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing.\nAs of December 28, 2024, our total outstanding consolidated debt was approximately $1.83 billion. Our level of indebtedness could restrict our operations and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This ability, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our assets, borrowing and other financial restrictions imposed by lenders and conditions in the credit markets at the time we refinance. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms, we may be forced to agree to otherwise unfavorable financing terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, so long as we comply with any existing limitations in our credit and debt agreements while they are in effect, we may issue an indeterminate amount of debt securities from time to time. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face could intensify.\nOur credit facilities, the indenture related to our 1.75% Senior Notes, 5.25% Senior Notes, and other debt instruments have restrictive covenants and change of control provisions that could limit our financial and business flexibility.\nOur credit agreement governing our senior credit facilities and our note purchase and private shelf agreement governing our senior unsecured notes due August 14, 2029 (the “3.70% Senior Notes”) each contain financial, operative and other restrictive covenants in addition to the restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing our 1.75% Senior Notes and 5.25% Senior Notes (as defined in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Our failure to comply with those covenants \ncould result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, upon certain events constituting a change of control, as that term is defined in the indenture for our 1.75% Senior Notes, 5.25% Senior Notes, and in our note purchase and private shelf agreement for our 3.70% Senior Notes, we are required to make an offer in cash to repurchase all or any part of each holder's 1.75% Senior Notes as well as 5.25% Senior Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the principal thereof, plus accrued interest, and to prepay all of each holder’s 3.70% Senior Notes at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the principal thereof, plus accrued interest. Sufficient funds may not be available to us, however, at the time of any change of control event to repurchase and prepay, as applicable, all or a portion of the tendered notes pursuant to these requirements. Our failure to offer to repurchase the 1.75% Senior Notes and the 5.25% Senior Notes and prepay 3.70% Senior Notes, or to repurchase and prepay, as applicable, notes tendered, following a change of control will result in a default under the indentures for our 1.75% Senior Notes, 5.25% Senior Notes, and the note purchase and private shelf agreement for our 3.70% Senior Notes, which could lead to a cross-default under our credit agreement for our senior credit facilities. \nWe cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or any guaranty that we will continue to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program. \nAlthough our Board of Directors has indicated an intention to pay future quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, any determination to pay or increase cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be based primarily upon our financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, and our Board of Directors’ continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the dividend. Furthermore, although our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $6.50 billion, we may temporarily pause or permanently discontinue this program at any time or significantly reduce the amount of repurchases under the program. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $487.3 million, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses. \nThe market price for our common stock might be volatile and could result in a decline in value. \nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results, general trends and prospects for the retail industry, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts’ or investors’ expectations, the condition of the financial markets, and other factors. The Company’s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay. That multiple is in part dependent on investors’ perception of the Company’s future earnings growth prospects. If investors’ perception of the Company’s earnings growth prospects change, the Company’s earnings multiple may decline and its stock price could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock market has at times experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance. \nImpairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of an acquired company and the related fair value of net assets acquired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists. As with goodwill, we also test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors indicating impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated or changing competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and reduced growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that business conditions deteriorate or if changes in key assumptions and estimates differ significantly from management's expectations, it may be necessary to record additional impairment charges in the future which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe are subject to personal injury, workers’ compensation, product liability, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wage and hour, and other claims in the ordinary course of business.\nOur business involves a risk of personal injury, workers’ compensation, product liability, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wage and hour, and other claims in the ordinary course of business.  Product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or write-off of merchandise inventories, the incurrence of fines or penalties, and damage to our reputation. We maintain general liability with a self-insured retention and workers’ compensation insurance with a deductible for each occurrence.  We also maintain umbrella limits above the primary general liability and product liability coverage.  In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of the products and their products liability insurance, as well as the property owners of our leased buildings.  Our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers, manufacturers, and landlords and the specific allegations of a claim.  No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers’ or landlords’ indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.\nAdditionally, we are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local employment laws that expose us to potential liability if we are determined to have violated such employment laws, including but not limited to, laws pertaining to minimum wage rates, overtime pay, discrimination, harassment, and wrongful termination. Compliance with these laws, including the remediation of any alleged violation, may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of federal, state, local, or foreign laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws and governmental regulations including those relating to competition, environmental protection, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer product safety, building, land use and zoning requirements, workplace regulations, wage and hour, privacy and information security, pricing, record management, and employment law matters. \nOur operations, including our outsourced exclusive brand manufacturing partners, are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and by various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products, including food safety standards.\nIf we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations, or if these laws or regulations are violated by importers, manufacturers or distributors, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs. In addition, our capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations.\nWe are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business, and the anti-bribery laws of other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar laws could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPotential noncompliance with environmental regulations could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition, or reputation.\nOur business is subject to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and other requirements pertaining to protection of the environment and public health, including, for example, regulations governing the management of waste materials and waste waters.  Governmental agencies on the federal, state, and local levels have, in recent years, increasingly focused on the retail sector’s compliance with such laws and regulations, and have at times pursued enforcement activities.  We periodically receive information requests and notices of potential noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations from governmental agencies, which are addressed on a case-by-case basis with the relevant agency. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or reputation.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business and results.\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nEffective tax rate changes and results of examinations by taxing authorities could materially impact our results.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by legislative tax reform, changes in statutory rates or changes in tax laws, or interpretations thereof. Additionally, our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states where we have lower statutory rates and higher than historical results in states where we have higher statutory rates or by changes in the measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. \nWe are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), as well as state and local taxing authorities. Like many retailers, a portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment.  These circumstances create risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance. Our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.",
