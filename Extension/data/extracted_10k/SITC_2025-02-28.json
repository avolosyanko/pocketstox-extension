      "text": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\n SITE Centers Corp., an Ohio corporation (the “Company” or “SITE Centers”), is a self-administered and self-managed Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”) engaged in the business of owning, leasing, acquiring, redeveloping and managing shopping centers. Unless otherwise provided, references herein to the Company or SITE Centers include SITE Centers Corp. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures.\nOn October 1, 2024, the Company completed the spin-off of 79 convenience retail properties consisting of approximately 2.7 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”) into a separately traded company named Curbline Properties Corp. (“Curbline” or “Curbline Properties”). In connection with the spin-off, on October 1, 2024, the Company, Curbline and Curbline Properties LP (the “Operating Partnership”) entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the “Separation and Distribution Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Company transferred its portfolio of convenience retail properties, $800.0 million of unrestricted cash and certain other assets, liabilities and obligations to Curbline and effected a pro rata special distribution of all of the outstanding shares of Curbline common stock to common shareholders of the Company as of September 23, 2024, the record date. On the spin-off date, holders of the Company’s common shares received two shares of common stock of Curbline for every one common share of the Company held on the record date.\nThe spin-off of the convenience properties represented a strategic shift in the Company’s business and, as such, the Curbline properties were considered as held for sale as of October 1, 2024 and are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Except as otherwise noted, operating statistics cited in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 have been adjusted for discontinued operations and properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n The Company is self-administered and self-managed, and therefore, has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisor. The Company manages all of its shopping centers which are collectively referred to herein as the “Portfolio Properties”. At December 31, 2024, the Company owned 33 shopping centers (including 11 shopping centers owned through unconsolidated joint ventures) totaling 8.8 million square feet of GLA through all its properties (wholly-owned and joint venture). At December 31, 2024, the aggregate occupancy of the Company’s operating shopping center portfolio was 90.6% on a pro rata basis, and the average annualized base rent per occupied square foot was $19.64, on a pro rata basis. In addition, the Company owns two adjacent office buildings located in Beachwood, Ohio, totaling approximately 339,000 square feet of GLA, of which approximately 172,000 square feet of GLA currently serves as the Company's headquarters and approximately 167,000 square feet of GLA is leased or available to be leased to third parties.\n The primary source of the Company’s income is generated from the rental of the Company’s Portfolio Properties to tenants. In addition, the Company generates revenue from its management contracts with its unconsolidated joint ventures and the Shared Services Agreement (defined below) with Curbline.\n Strategy\n The Company’s mission is to own and manage open-air shopping centers primarily located in suburban, high household income communities. The overall investment, operating and financing policies of the Company, which govern a variety of activities, such as capital allocations, dividends and status as a REIT, are determined by management and the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may amend or revise the Company’s policies from time to time without a vote of the Company’s shareholders.\nFrom July 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024, the Company generated approximately $3.1 billion of gross proceeds from sales of properties for the purpose of acquiring additional convenience properties, capitalizing Curbline and, together with proceeds from the closing and funding of a $530.0 million mortgage loan (the “Mortgage Facility”), redeeming and/or repaying all of the Company’s outstanding unsecured indebtedness and preferred shares. Going forward, the Company intends to realize value through operations and to consider various factors, including market conditions and differences between the public and private valuations of its portfolio, in evaluating whether and when to pursue additional asset sales. The timing of any additional sales may also be impacted by interim leasing, tactical redevelopment activities and other asset management initiatives intended to maximize value. As of February 28, 2025, the Company was in the beginning stages of marketing a select number of assets for sale, though no assurances can be given that such efforts will result in additional asset sales, particularly in light of the dynamic interest rate environment and capital markets conditions. The Company expects to use proceeds from any additional asset sales to repay outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to shareholders.\n\nThe Company expects that rental income and net income will decrease in future periods as compared to corresponding prior year periods as a result of the spin-off of Curbline and the significant volume of dispositions completed in 2024. The Company expects that its future dividend policy will be influenced by operations and asset sales, though the Company’s distribution of any sale proceeds to shareholders will be subject to collateral release and repayment requirements set forth in the terms of the Company’s indebtedness and the prudent management of liquidity and overall leverage levels in connection with ongoing operations.\n Growth opportunities within the Company’s portfolio include rental rate increases, continued lease-up of the portfolio and rent commencement with respect to recently executed leases.\nNarrative Description of Business\n The Company’s portfolio as of December 31, 2024, consisted of 33 shopping centers (including 11 centers owned through unconsolidated joint ventures) located in 15 states. The following tables present the operating statistics affecting base rental revenues summarized by the following portfolios: pro rata combined shopping center portfolio, wholly-owned shopping center portfolio and joint venture shopping center portfolio:\n\n                                                                                        Pro Rata Combined    \n                                                                                Shopping Center Portfolio    \n                                                                                             December 31,    \n                                                        2024                                      2023(A)    \nCenters owned                                                      33                                  33    \nAggregate occupancy rate                                         90.6     %                          89.5   %\nAverage annualized base rent per occupied square foot          $19.64                              $19.42    \n\n                                                                                     Wholly-Owned                                       Joint Venture    \n                                                                                 Shopping Centers                                    Shopping Centers    \n                                                                                     December 31,                                        December 31,    \n2024                                                                                      2023(A)       2024                                  2023(A)    \nCenters owned                                                  22                              22                  11                              11    \nAggregate occupancy rate                                     90.6    %                       89.5   %            91.6    %                       91.6   %\nAverage annualized base rent per occupied square foot      $19.81                          $19.63              $16.64                          $16.32    \n (A)Operating statistics have been adjusted for discontinued operations and properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2024.\n Material Agreements with Curbline Properties\n In addition to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, on October 1, 2024, the Company entered into a Shared Services Agreement with Curbline Properties and the Operating Partnership (the “Shared Services Agreement”) that requires the Company to provide the services of its employees and the use or benefit of its assets, offices and other resources as may be necessary or useful for Curbline to establish and operate various business functions of the Operating Partnership or its affiliates in a manner as would be established and operated for a REIT similarly situated to Curbline. Additionally, the Operating Partnership or its affiliates, subject to the supervision of the Company’s Board of Directors, will provide the Company (i) leadership and management services that are of a nature customarily performed by leadership and management overseeing the business and operation of a REIT similarly situated to SITE Centers, including supervising various business functions of SITE Centers necessary for the day-to-day management operations of SITE Centers and its affiliates and (ii) transaction services that are of a nature customarily performed by a dedicated transactions team within an organization similarly situated to SITE Centers, including the provision of personnel at both the leadership and operational levels necessary to ensure effective and efficient preparation, negotiation, execution and implementation of real estate transactions, as well as overseeing post-transaction activities and alignment with SITE Centers’ strategic objectives. The Operating Partnership or its affiliates provides the Company with a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer but the Company employs its own Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and General Counsel. The Company also provides Curbline Properties and its affiliates an option to enter into a lease agreement for office space at SITE Centers’ corporate headquarters location in Beachwood, Ohio for an initial five-year term with the right to extend the lease for up to four successive terms of five years each.\n As compensation for the services provided under the Shared Services Agreement, the Operating Partnership will pay a monthly fee to the Company in the amount of 2.0% of Curbline’s Gross Revenue (as defined in the Shared Services Agreement). There is no separate fee paid by the Company in connection with the provision of services by the Operating Partnership or its affiliates under the Shared Services Agreement. Unless terminated earlier, the term of the Shared Services Agreement will expire on October 1, 2027. In the event of certain early terminations of the Shared Services Agreement, the Company will be obligated to pay a termination fee to the Operating Partnership equal to $2.5 million multiplied by the number of whole or partial fiscal quarters\n\nremaining in the Shared Services Agreement’s three-year term (or $12.0 million in the event the Company terminates the agreement for convenience on its second anniversary).\nThe Company, Curbline and the Operating Partnership also entered into a tax matters agreement (the “Tax Matters Agreement”), which governs the rights, responsibilities and obligations of the parties following the spin-off with respect to various tax matters and provides for the allocation of tax-related assets, liabilities and obligations. In addition, the Company, Curbline and the Operating Partnership entered into an employee matters agreement (the “Employee Matters Agreement”), which governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of the parties following the spin-off with respect to transitioning employees, equity plans and retirement plans, health and welfare benefits, and other employment, compensation and benefit-related matters.\n The Separation and Distribution Agreement also contains provisions that obligate the Company to complete certain redevelopment projects at properties that are owned by Curbline. As of December 31, 2024, these redevelopment projects were estimated to cost $32.9 million to complete.\n Recent Developments\n See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference, for information on certain recent developments of the Company.\nTenants and Competition\n The Company has established close relationships with a large number of major national and regional tenants, and the Company’s management is associated with, and actively participates in, many shopping center and REIT industry organizations. Notwithstanding these relationships, numerous real estate companies and developers, private and public, compete with the Company in leasing space in shopping centers to tenants. The Company competes with other real estate companies and developers in terms of rental rate, property location, availability of space, management services and property condition.\nThe Company’s five largest tenants based on the Company’s aggregate annualized base rental revenues, including its proportionate share of joint venture aggregate annualized base rental revenues, are TJX Companies, Inc., Dick's Sporting Goods, Inc., Burlington Stores, Inc., The Kroger Co. and PetSmart, Inc., representing 4.6%, 4.4%, 4.3%, 3.6% and 3.3%, respectively, of the Company’s aggregate annualized base rental revenues at December 31, 2024. For more information on the Company’s tenants, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Company Fundamentals.”\nQualification as a Real Estate Investment Trust\n The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the federal income tax laws. As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its shareholders. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), REITs are subject to numerous regulatory requirements, including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90% of taxable income each year. The Company will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates if it fails to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes in any taxable year, or to the extent it distributes less than 100% of its taxable income. The Company will also generally not qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Even if the Company qualifies as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income.\nIn the past, the Company has elected to treat certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”). In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. As of February 28, 2025, the Company does not currently own a subsidiary it treats as a TRS.\nHuman Capital Management\n As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s workforce was composed of 172 full-time employees compared to 220 full-time employees at December 31, 2023. This reduction reflects, in part, the transition of employment of several former employees to Curbline Properties and its affiliates on October 1, 2024. Of the Company’s employees, 78% of employees were assigned to work in the corporate headquarters in Beachwood, Ohio, with the rest working in regional offices or remotely. Many of the Company’s employees have a long tenure with the Company, with approximately 83% of the Company’s employees having been with the Company for over 5 years and 60% for over 10 years.\n\n\nThe Company’s primary human capital management objective is to attract, develop, engage and retain the highest quality talent. To support this objective, the Company offers competitive pay and benefit programs, a broad focus on wellness and flexible work arrangements designed to allow employees to meet personal and family needs. The Company currently utilizes a hybrid work schedule that provides employees the opportunity to work remotely on a limited basis while continuing to cultivate in-office relationships and learning, which are key elements to the Company’s culture. The Company also takes steps to improve upon its level of employee engagement and to create an inclusive workplace. The Company’s employees are expected to exhibit honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. The Company annually requires its employees to complete training modules on sexual harassment and discrimination and to acknowledge and certify their compliance with the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Senior members of its accounting, finance and capital markets and asset management departments are also required to acknowledge and agree to the Company’s Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers on an annual basis. The Company’s culture is also underpinned by its employees’ commitment to the Company’s core values of being Fearless, Authentic, Curious and Thoughtful (the Company’s “Matters of FACT”) in the conduct of their responsibilities.\nCorporate Responsibility and Sustainability\n Detailed information regarding the Company’s approach to sustainability can be found on the Company’s website in its Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Report. This report is based on the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) standard, which summarizes environmental and social performance, and includes disclosures with respect to Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) and Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures (“TCFD”) standards. The content of the Company’s sustainability report is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document filed with the SEC, unless expressly noted.\n Information About the Company’s Executive Officers\nThe section below provides information regarding the Company’s executive officers as of February 28, 2025:\n David R.

RISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risk Factors\n The following is a summary of material risks that could affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. The risks summarized below are discussed in greater detail in the risk factors that follow and are not the only risks the Company faces. The Company’s business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to it or that the Company currently considers to be immaterial to its operations. Investors should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to the Company’s Business, Properties and Strategy\n•The economic performance and value of the Company’s shopping centers depend on many factors, including broad economic climate and local conditions, each of which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s cash flows and operating results. \n •An increase in e-commerce market share may have an adverse impact on the Company’s tenants and business. \n •The Company leases a substantial portion of its square footage to large national tenants, making it vulnerable to changes in the business and financial condition of, or demand for, its space by such tenants. \n •The Company’s dependence on rental income may adversely affect its results of operations. \n •The Company’s expenses may remain constant or increase even if income from the Company’s properties decreases. \n •Inflationary pressures could adversely impact the Company’s tenants and operating results. \n •Rising interest rates could adversely affect the Company’s strategy. \n •Property ownership through partnerships and joint ventures could limit the Company’s control of those investments and reduce its expected return. \n •The Company’s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges. \n\n\n•Real estate property investments are illiquid; therefore, the Company may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms. \n •The Company’s real estate investments may contain environmental risks that could adversely affect its results of operations. \n •Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm and other adverse effects on the Company’s business. \n •The Company may be adversely impacted by laws, regulations or other issues related to climate change. \n •The Company’s properties could be subject to climate change, damage from natural disasters, public health crises and weather-related factors; an uninsured loss on the Company’s properties or a loss that exceeds the limits of the Company’s insurance policies could subject the Company to lost capital or revenue on those properties. \n •Crime or civil unrest may affect the markets in which the Company operates its business and its profitability. \n •A disruption, failure or breach of the Company’s networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm its business. \n •Disruptions or cost overruns in the transition of the Company’s commercial property management and financial system could affect its operations.\n Risks Relating to the Company’s Indebtedness and Capital Structure\n •The Company does not maintain a revolving credit facility which could adversely affect its ability to fund its business.\n •The Company utilizes a significant amount of indebtedness in the operation of its business which could adversely affect its financial condition, operating results and cash flows. \n •The Company’s financial condition and operating activities could be adversely affected by financial covenants. \n •The Company’s ability to increase its debt could adversely affect its financial condition and cash flows. \n •The Company may not be able to obtain additional capital to finance its operations.\n Risks Related to the Company’s Taxation as a REIT\n •If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a regular corporation and could have significant tax liability, which may have a significant adverse consequence to the value of the Company’s shares. \n •Compliance with REIT requirements may negatively affect the Company’s operating decisions. \n •The Company may be forced to borrow funds to maintain its REIT status, and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, may cause the Company to dispose of assets at inopportune times, which could materially and adversely affect the Company. \n •Dividends paid by REITs generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates. \n •Certain foreign shareholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of the Company’s common shares if the Company does not qualify as a “domestically controlled” REIT. \n •Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on the Company.\n Risks Related to the Company’s Organization, Structure and Ownership\n •Provisions of the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, even if that change may be considered beneficial by some of the Company’s shareholders. \n\n\n•The Company’s Board of Directors may change significant corporate policies without shareholder approval.\n Risks Related to the Company’s Relationship with Curbline Properties\n•The Company’s relationship with Curbline Properties may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest. \n •The agreements with Curbline Properties were not negotiated on an arm’s-length basis and may not be on the same terms as if they had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party. \n •The Company is required to provide services and certain benefits to Curbline Properties for the duration of the Shared Services Agreement, even if it is economically inefficient to do so.\nRisks Related to the Company’s Common Shares\n •Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s publicly traded securities.\n •The Company may issue additional securities without shareholder approval.\n General Risks Relating to Investments in the Company’s Securities\n •The Company may be unable to retain and attract key management personnel.\n •The Company is subject to litigation that could adversely affect its results of operations.\n The risks summarized above are discussed in greater detail below.\n Risks Related to the Company’s Business, Properties and Strategies\n The Economic Performance and Value of the Company’s Shopping Centers Depend on Many Factors, Including Broad Economic Climate and Local Conditions, Each of Which Could Have an Adverse Impact on the Company’s Cash Flows and Operating Results\n The economic performance and value of the Company’s real estate holdings can be affected by many factors, including the following:\n •Changes in the national, regional, local and international economic climate; \n •Local conditions, such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area and population, demographic and employment trends; \n •The attractiveness of the properties to tenants; \n •The increase in consumer purchases through the internet; \n •The Company’s ability to provide adequate management services and to maintain its properties; \n •Increased operating costs if these costs cannot be passed through to tenants and \n •The expense of renovating, repairing and re-letting spaces. \n Because the Company’s properties consist of retail shopping centers, the Company’s performance is linked to general economic conditions in the retail market, including conditions that affect consumers’ purchasing behaviors and disposable income. The market for retail space historically has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by weakness in the national, regional and local economies, the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies, the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector, increases in consumer internet purchases and the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets. The Company’s performance is affected by its tenants’ results of operations, which are impacted by macroeconomic factors that affect consumers’ ability to purchase goods and services. If the price of the goods and services offered by the Company’s tenants materially increases, including as a result of inflationary pressures or increases in taxes or tariffs resulting from, among other things, potential changes in the Code, the operating results and the financial condition of the Company’s tenants and demand for retail space could be adversely affected. To the extent that any of these conditions occur, they are likely to affect market rents for retail space. In addition, the Company may face challenges\n\nin the management and maintenance of its properties or incur increased operating costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, that may make its properties unattractive to tenants.\nIn addition, the Company’s properties compete with numerous shopping venues, including regional malls, outlet centers and other shopping centers in attracting and retaining retailers. As of December 31, 2024, leases at the Company’s properties (including the proportionate share of unconsolidated properties) were scheduled to expire on a total of approximately 6.8% of leased GLA during 2025. For those leases that renew, rental rates upon renewal may be lower than current rates. For those leases that do not renew, the Company may not be able to promptly re-lease the space on favorable terms or with reasonable capital investments. In these situations, the Company’s financial condition, operating results and cash flows and the market value of its properties could be adversely impacted.\n An Increase in E-Commerce Market Share May Have an Adverse Impact on the Company’s Tenants and Business\n E-commerce has been broadly embraced by the public and growth in e-commerce is likely to continue in the future. Some of the Company’s tenants have been negatively impacted by increasing competition from internet retailers, and this trend could affect the way current and future tenants lease space. For example, the migration toward e-commerce has led a number of omni-channel retailers to reduce the number and size of their traditional “brick and mortar” locations, and increasingly rely on e-commerce and alternative distribution channels. The Company cannot predict with certainty how continuing growth in e-commerce will impact the demand for space at its properties or how much revenue will be generated at traditional store locations in the future. If the Company is unable to anticipate and respond promptly to trends in retailer and consumer behavior, or if demand for traditional retail space significantly decreases, the Company’s occupancy levels and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n The Company Leases a Substantial Portion of Its Square Footage to Large National Tenants, Making It Vulnerable to Changes in the Business and Financial Condition of, or Demand for, Its Space by Such Tenants\nAs of December 31, 2024, the annualized base rental revenues of the Company’s tenants that are equal to or exceed 1.5% of the Company’s aggregate annualized shopping center base rental revenues, including the Company’s proportionate share of joint venture aggregate annualized shopping center base rental revenues, are as follows:\n\nTenant                        % of Annualized Base\n                                   Rental Revenues\nTJX Companies, Inc.                           4.6%\nDick's Sporting Goods, Inc.                   4.4%\nBurlington Stores, Inc.                       4.3%\nThe Kroger Co.                                3.6%\nPetSmart, Inc.                                3.3%\nFitness International LLC                     3.2%\nBest Buy Co., Inc.                            2.9%\nRoss Stores, Inc.                             2.4%\nMichaels Companies, Inc.                      1.7%\nFive Below, Inc.                              1.7%\nUlta Beauty, Inc.                             1.5%\n The retail shopping sector has been affected by economic conditions, increases in consumer internet purchases and the competitive nature of the retail business and the competition for market share. In some cases, these shifts have resulted in weaker retailers losing market share and declaring bankruptcy, closing stores and/or taking advantage of early termination provisions in their leases. In addition, movie theater operators have experienced inconsistent performance since the COVID-19 pandemic and prospects for releasing any theater vacancies arising in the Company’s portfolio may be limited absent the investment of significant capital to repurpose the space. In 2024, rents from movie theater operators comprised 4.6% of the Company’s aggregate annualized shopping center base revenues (at the Company’s share).\n The Company’s Dependence on Rental Income May Adversely Affect Its Results of Operations\n Substantially all of the Company’s income is derived from rental income from real property. As a result, the Company’s results of operations could be negatively affected if a significant number of its tenants, or any of its major tenants, were to do the following:\n •Experience a downturn in their business that significantly weakens their ability to meet their obligations to the Company;\n •Delay lease commencements; \n\n\n•Decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration; \n •Fail to make rental payments when due or \n •Close stores or declare bankruptcy. \n Any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants’ leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. In addition, the Company may be required to write off and/or accelerate depreciation and amortization expense associated with a significant portion of the tenant-related deferred charges in future periods. Lease terminations by an anchor tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises may also permit other tenants in the same shopping centers to terminate their leases or reduce the amount of rent they pay under the terms of their leases. The Company cannot be certain that any tenant whose lease expires will renew that lease or that the Company will be able to re-lease space on economically advantageous terms. The loss of rental revenues from a number of the Company’s major tenants and its inability to replace such tenants may adversely affect the Company’s profitability, its ability to meet debt and other financial obligations and make distributions to shareholders, and the attractiveness of the Company’s properties to potential buyers thereof. In the event the Company is able to re-lease spaces vacated by major bankrupt, distressed or non-renewing tenants, the downtime and capital expenditures required in the re-leasing process may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.\n The Company’s Expenses May Remain Constant or Increase Even if Income from the Company’s Properties Decreases\n Costs associated with the Company’s business, such as common area expenses, utilities, insurance, real estate taxes, mortgage payments and corporate expenses, are relatively inflexible and generally do not decrease in the event that a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, a tenant fails to pay rent or other circumstances cause the Company’s revenues to decrease. In addition, other factors can cause operating costs to increase independent of occupancy, rental and default rates, such as inflation. If the Company is unable to lower its operating costs when property-level revenues decline and/or is unable to pass along cost increases to tenants, the Company’s cash flows, profitability and ability to make distributions to shareholders could be adversely impacted.\nInflationary Pressures Could Adversely Impact the Company’s Tenants and Operating Results\n Inflationary pressures pose risks to the Company’s business, tenants and the U.S. economy. Inflationary pressures and rising interest rates could result in reductions in retailer profitability and consumer discretionary spending which could impact tenant demand for new and existing store locations and the Company’s ability to maintain or grow rents. Regardless of inflation levels, base rent under most of the Company’s long-term anchor leases will remain constant (subject to tenants’ exercise of renewal options at pre-negotiated rent increases) until the expiration of their lease terms. Inflation may result in increases in certain shopping center operating expenses including common area maintenance and other operating expenses. Although most of the Company’s leases require tenants to pay their share of these property operating expenses, some tenants may be unable to absorb large expense increases caused by inflation and such increased expenses may limit tenants’ ability to pay higher base rents upon renewal, or renew leases at all. Inflation may also impact other aspects of the Company’s operating costs, including insurance, employee retention costs, the cost to complete build-outs of recently leased vacancies and interest rate costs relating to variable-rate loans and refinancing of fixed-rate indebtedness.\nRising Interest Rates Could Adversely Impact the Company’s Strategy\n A component of the Company’s strategy includes exploring opportunities to sell additional properties at attractive values. Increasing interest rates or capital availability constraints may impact the transaction market, including asset values and the availability of acquisition financing. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Company’s properties and its ability to sell additional properties.\nProperty Ownership Through Partnerships and Joint Ventures Could Limit the Company’s Control of Those Investments and Reduce Its Expected Return\n Partnership or joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by the Company, including the possibility that the Company’s partner or co-venturer might become bankrupt, that its partner or co-venturer might at any time have different interests or goals than the Company and that its partner or co-venturer may take action contrary to the Company’s instructions, requests, policies or objectives, including the Company’s policy with respect to maintaining its qualification as a REIT. In addition, the Company’s partner or co-venturer could have different investment criteria that would impact the assets held by the joint venture or its interest in the joint venture, which may also reduce the carrying value of its equity investments if a loss in the carrying value of the investment is realized. These situations could have an impact on the Company’s revenues from its joint ventures. Other risks of joint venture investments include impasse on decisions, such as the decision to sell or finance a property or leasing decisions with anchor tenants, because neither the Company’s partner or co-venturer nor the Company would have full control over the partnership or joint venture. Joint venture platforms typically contain customary buy-sell provisions, which could result in either\n\nthe sale of the Company’s interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire the Company’s partner’s interest at inopportune times, as well as the termination of applicable management contracts and fees. In addition, the Company is obligated to maintain the REIT status of the Dividend Trust Portfolio joint venture’s REIT subsidiary and the Company’s failure to do so could result in substantial liability to its partner. These factors could limit the return that the Company receives from such investments, cause its cash flows to be lower than its estimates or lead to business conflicts or litigation. There is no limitation under the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, or its Code of Regulations, as to the amount of funds that the Company may invest in partnerships or joint ventures. In addition, a partner or co-venturer may not have access to sufficient capital to satisfy its funding obligations to the joint venture. Furthermore, if credit conditions in the capital markets deteriorate, the Company could be required to reduce the carrying value of its equity method investments if a loss in the carrying value of the investment is realized or considered an other than temporary decline. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $30.4 million of investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures holding shopping centers.\n\nThe Company’s Real Estate Assets May Be Subject to Impairment Charges\nOn a periodic basis, the Company assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of its real estate assets and other investments may be impaired. A property’s value is impaired only if the estimate of the aggregate future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property. In the Company’s estimate of projected cash flows, it considers factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, the effects of demand, competition, estimated hold periods and other factors. If the Company is evaluating the potential sale of an asset, the asset’s undiscounted future cash flows are estimated based on the most likely course of action at the balance sheet date, including current plans, intended holding periods and available market information. The Company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate assets and other investments. These assessments have a direct impact on the Company’s earnings because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to earnings. There can be no assurance that the Company will not take significant impairment charges in the future, especially in light of its strategy to explore the sale of additional assets. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken.\nReal Estate Property Investments Are Illiquid; Therefore, the Company May Not Be Able to Dispose of Properties When Desired or on Favorable Terms\n Real estate investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly. In addition, the Code imposes restrictions, which are not applicable to other types of real estate companies, on the ability of a REIT to dispose of properties. Therefore, the Company may not be able to diversify or alter its portfolio in response to economic conditions or trends in retailer or consumer behavior promptly or on favorable terms. The Company’s inability to quickly respond to such changes or dispose of properties could adversely affect the value of the Company’s portfolio and its ability to repay indebtedness and make distributions to shareholders.\nThe Company’s Real Estate Investments May Contain Environmental Risks That Could Adversely Affect Its Results of Operations\n The ownership of properties may subject the Company to liabilities, including environmental liabilities. The Company’s operating expenses could be higher than anticipated due to the cost of complying with existing or future environmental laws and regulations. In addition, under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, the Company may be considered an owner or operator of real property or to have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances. As a result, the Company may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in its properties. The Company may also be liable for other potential costs that could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). The Company may incur such liability whether or not it knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Such liability could be of substantial magnitude and divert management’s attention from other aspects of the Company’s business and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results and financial condition, as well as its ability to make distributions to shareholders. As of December 31, 2024, the Company continued to remediate and explore permanent solutions with the applicable state environmental protection agency with respect to groundwater contamination detected at one of its properties. The presence of contamination or the failure to successfully complete its remediation may adversely affect the Company’s ability to lease or sell the property.\nExpectations Relating to Environmental, Social and Governance Considerations Expose the Company to Potential Liabilities, Increased Costs, Reputational Harm and Other Adverse Effects on the Company’s Business\n In recent years, many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. The Company has made statements about ESG considerations through information provided on its website, press releases and other communications, including through its Corporate Responsibility and\n\nSustainability Report. Disclosures regarding ESG considerations involve risks and uncertainties. Some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s approach to ESG and stakeholders’ ESG views may change and evolve over time. The Company may also change its approach to ESG, due to a broader change in strategy, reduced relevance of such initiatives or changing market conditions. Reporting certain ESG metrics also involves the use of estimates and assumptions and reliance on third-party information that cannot be independently verified by the Company if it is available at all. The Company expects to incur additional costs to comply with any applicable ESG disclosure obligations, including disclosures relating to the impact of climate change on the Company’s business. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to further ESG initiatives, adhere to its public statements, accurately report sustainability metrics, comply with federal or state ESG laws and regulations, which themselves may be subject to evolving standards and practices, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and disclosure standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and/or materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\n The Company May Be Adversely Impacted by Laws, Regulations or Other Issues Related To Climate Change\n The Company may become subject to laws or regulations related to climate change, which could cause its business, results of operations and financial condition to be impacted adversely. Governments have enacted certain climate change laws and regulations and have begun regulating carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions. Although many of these laws and regulations remain subject to legal challenges and have not had any known material impact on the Company’s business to date, they could result in substantial costs, including compliance costs, increased energy costs, retrofit costs and construction costs, including monitoring and reporting costs, and capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and other new equipment. The Company cannot predict how laws and regulations related to climate change will affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s Properties Could Be Subject to Climate Change, Damage from Natural Disasters, Public Health Crises and Weather-Related Factors; An Uninsured Loss on the Company’s Properties or a Loss That Exceeds the Limits of the Company’s Insurance Policies Could Subject the Company to Lost Capital or Revenue on Those Properties\n The Company’s properties are generally open-air shopping centers. Extreme weather conditions may impact the profitability of the Company’s tenants by decreasing traffic at or hindering access to the Company’s properties, which may decrease the amount of rent the Company collects. Furthermore, a number of the Company’s properties are located in coastal areas that are subject to natural disasters, including the Southeast and California. Such properties could therefore be affected by hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes and wildfires. The potential impacts of climate change on the Company’s operations are highly uncertain but could include local changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperature averages or extremes. Furthermore, a public health crisis or other catastrophic event could adversely affect economies, financial markets and consumer behaviors and lead to an economic downturn, which could harm the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.\n The Company’s insurance premiums have increased in recent years, and the potential increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, extreme weather-related events and climate change in the future may limit the types of coverage and the coverage limits the Company is able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms.\nThe Company currently maintains all-risk property insurance with limits of $250 million per occurrence and in the aggregate and general liability insurance with limits of $100 million per occurrence and in the aggregate, in each case subject to various conditions, exclusions, deductibles and sub-limits for certain perils such as windstorm, flood and earthquake. Coverage for named windstorms, floods and earthquakes in high-risk areas is generally subject to a deductible of up to 5% of the total insured value of each property. The amount of any insurance coverage for losses due to damage or business interruption may prove to be insufficient. Should a loss occur that is uninsured or is in an amount exceeding the aggregate limits for the applicable insurance policy, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, the Company could lose all or part of its capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results and financial condition, as well as its ability to make distributions to shareholders.\nCrime or Civil Unrest May Affect the Markets in Which the Company Operates Its Business and Its Profitability\n Certain of the Company’s properties are located in or near major metropolitan areas or other areas that are susceptible to property and violent crime, including terrorist attacks, mass shootings and civil unrest. Increased incidence of property crime, such as shoplifting or damage caused by civil unrest, could reduce tenant profitability or demand for space and, as a result, decrease the rents the Company is able to collect from affected properties. Furthermore, any kind of violent criminal acts, including terrorist acts against public institutions or buildings or modes of public transportation (including airlines, trains or buses), or civil unrest could alter shopping habits, deter customers from visiting the Company’s shopping centers or result in damage to its properties. The Company may also incur increased expenses as a result of its efforts to provide enhanced security measures at its properties to contend with\n\ncriminal or other threats. Any of the foregoing circumstances could have a negative effect on the Company’s business, the operations of its tenants and the value of its properties.\nA Disruption, Failure or Breach of the Company’s Networks or Systems, Including as a Result of Cyber-Attacks, Could Harm Its Business\n The Company relies extensively on computer systems to manage its business, including to provide services to Curbline Properties and the Company’s joint ventures. While the Company maintains some of its own critical information technology systems, it also depends on third parties to provide important information technology services relating to several key business functions, such as payroll, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, facility damage, computer or telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats, including phishing attacks, ransomware and other sophisticated cyber-attacks. Although the Company and such third parties employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate cyber threats, including password protection, firewalls, backup servers, threat monitoring and periodic penetration testing, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Should they occur, these threats could compromise the confidential information of the Company’s tenants, employees, third-party vendors, joint ventures and other counterparties (including Curbline Properties); disrupt the Company’s business operations and the availability and integrity of data in the Company’s systems; and result in litigation, violation of applicable privacy and other laws, investigations, actions, fines or penalties. In the event of damage or disruption to the Company’s business due to these occurrences, the Company may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of its critical business functions, assets and data. Furthermore, while the Company maintains insurance, the coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses, claims or fines that may arise. For additional information see Item 1. “Business—Information Technology and Cybersecurity” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDisruptions or Cost Overruns in the Transition of the Company’s Commercial Property Management and Financial System Could Affect Its Operations\n The Company is in the process of transitioning to a new commercial property management and financial system. Implementation of the new system is a major undertaking, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective, and the conversion process is complex because of the wide range of existing processes and data that must be migrated to the new system. Should the new system not be implemented successfully and within budget, or if the system does not perform in a satisfactory manner, it could disrupt and adversely affect the Company’s operations, including the ability to timely bill and collect tenant payments and otherwise adequately service tenants, the ability to satisfy contractual obligations to the Company’s joint ventures and Curbline Properties, and the ability to report accurate and timely financial results, any of which could adversely impact the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and the price of the Company’s common shares.\nRisks Relating to the Company’s Indebtedness and Capital Structure\n The Company Does Not Maintain a Revolving Credit Facility Which Could Adversely Affect Its Ability to Fund Its Business\n In preparation for the spin-off of Curbline Properties, the Company repaid all of its unsecured indebtedness and terminated its revolving credit facility in August 2024. As a result, the Company does not maintain a line of credit that can be used to fund working capital needs. Although the Company seeks to conservatively manage its cash position in order to provide sufficient liquidity to operate its business, and owns certain unencumbered assets that could serve as collateral for additional financings, the Company may not be able to timely satisfy unexpected liabilities if they were to arise, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operations and financial condition.\nThe Company Utilizes a Significant Amount of Indebtedness in the Operation of its Business Which Could Adversely Affect Its Financial Condition, Operating Results and Cash Flows\n As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $306.8 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated indebtedness outstanding, consisting of (i) the cross-collateralized Mortgage Facility, having an outstanding principal balance of $206.9 million and maturing in September 2026 (subject to two one-year extension options) with an interest rate of 7.1% at December 31, 2024, and (ii) a mortgage loan secured by Nassau Park Pavilion, having an outstanding principal balance of $99.9 million and maturing in November 2028 with an interest rate of 6.7%. In addition, the Company’s unconsolidated joint ventures have $441.8 million of indebtedness ($106.6 million at SITE’s share) with a weighted-average interest rate of 6.2% and a weighted average maturity of 3.6 years (excluding extension options).\n Although the Company believes that it maintains prudent leverage levels, the Company’s ability to refinance its existing indebtedness at maturity will depend on the future performance of the Company and its properties and credit market conditions\n\ngenerally. The U.S. and global credit markets have experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the past, which have caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to fluctuate. These circumstances materially affected liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive and, in certain cases, resulting in the unavailability of financing for businesses and assets similar to those operated by the Company. In addition, volatility in benchmark interest rates may cause interest rates applicable to refinancings to exceed the interest rates applicable to the Company’s existing indebtedness which would negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and could adversely impact the amount the Company is able to distribute to its shareholders.\n The Company’s Financial Condition and Operating Activities Could Be Adversely Affected by Financial Covenants\n The instruments governing the Company’s debt, including the Mortgage Facility, contain operating covenants, including limitations on the Company’s ability to sell one or more of its mortgaged assets and incur additional indebtedness. These instruments also impose limitations on our ability to access operating cash from properties in the event the applicable loan’s debt yield is not maintained. The Mortgage Facility also contains covenants that require the Company to maintain certain levels of minimum net worth and liquid assets that could limit our financial and operational flexibility and the amount we are able to distribute to shareholders. In addition, the Mortgage Facility requires the Company to use proceeds from the sale of mortgaged properties to repay the release amounts related to such properties before allowing the Company to use sale proceeds for any other purpose (including to make distributions to shareholders). These instruments also contain customary default provisions, including the failure to pay principal and interest issued thereunder in a timely manner and the failure to comply with certain covenants. A default or breach of any of these covenants could allow the lender to foreclose on the properties serving as collateral for the applicable loan, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.\nThe Company’s Ability to Increase Its Debt Could Adversely Affect Its Financial Condition and Cash Flows\n The Company’s organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount or percentage of indebtedness it may incur. If the Company were to become more highly leveraged, its cash needs to fund debt service would increase accordingly. Under such circumstances, the Company’s risk of decreases in cash flow due to fluctuations in the real estate market, reliance on its major tenants and the other factors discussed in these risk factors could subject the Company to an even greater adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased leverage could increase the risk of default on the Company’s debt obligations, which could further reduce its cash available for distribution and adversely affect its ability to dispose of its portfolio on favorable terms, which could cause the Company to incur losses and reduce its cash flows.\nThe Company May Not Be Able to Obtain Additional Capital to Finance Its Operations\n To qualify as a REIT, the Company must, among other things, distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains) to its stockholders each year. Because of these distribution requirements, the Company has relied on third-party sources of capital, including secured and unsecured debt and common and preferred equity financings, to fund capital needs. Economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets may not be favorable at the time the Company needs to raise capital which may cause the Company to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require it to adjust its business plan accordingly. Disruptions in the financial markets may also have a material adverse effect on the market value of the Company’s common shares, the value of its properties in private market transactions and other adverse effects on the Company or the economy in general.\n Risks Related to the Company’s Taxation as a REIT\n If the Company Fails to Qualify as a REIT in Any Taxable Year, It Will Be Subject to U.S. Federal Income Tax as a Regular Corporation and Could Have Significant Tax Liability, Which May Have a Significant Adverse Consequence to the Value of the Company’s Shares\n The Company currently seeks to operate in a manner that allows it to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, REIT qualification requires that the Company satisfy numerous requirements (some on an annual or quarterly basis) established under highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, for which there are a limited number of judicial or administrative interpretations. The Company’s status as a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that are not entirely within its control. In addition, the amount of non-qualifying assets and income the Company can own and earn while still maintaining its REIT status has decreased in recent years due to the reduction in the size of the Company’s operations resulting from asset sales and the spin-off of Curbline and may continue to decrease. Accordingly, the Company’s ability to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not certain and cannot be assured. Even a technical or inadvertent violation of the REIT requirements could jeopardize the Company’s REIT qualification. Furthermore, Congress or the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) might change the tax laws or regulations and the courts could issue new rulings, in each case potentially having a retroactive\n\neffect that could make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to continue to qualify as a REIT. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any tax year, the following will result:\n •The Company would be taxed as a regular domestic corporation, which, among other things, means that it would be unable to deduct distributions to its shareholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates;\n •Any resulting tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders and could force the Company to liquidate assets or take other actions that could have a detrimental effect on its operating results and\n •Unless the Company were entitled to relief under applicable provisions, it would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the Company lost its qualification, and its cash available for debt service obligations and distribution to its shareholders, therefore, would be reduced for each of the years in which the Company does not qualify as a REIT. \n Even if the Company remains qualified as a REIT, it may face other tax liabilities that directly or indirectly reduce its cash flow. The Company may conduct certain non-qualifying operations through a TRS, which is subject to taxation, and any changes in the laws affecting the Company’s use of a TRS may increase the Company’s tax expenses. The Company may also be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on its income and property either directly or at the level of its subsidiaries. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for debt service obligations and distribution to the Company’s shareholders.\nCompliance with REIT Requirements May Negatively Affect the Company’s Operating Decisions\n To maintain its status as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company must meet certain requirements on an ongoing basis, including requirements regarding its sources of income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amounts the Company distributes to its shareholders and the ownership of its shares. The Company may also be required to make distributions to its shareholders when it does not have funds readily available for distribution or at times when the Company’s funds are otherwise needed to fund capital expenditures or debt service obligations.\nAs a REIT, the Company must distribute at least 90% of its annual net taxable income (excluding net capital gains) to its shareholders. To the extent that the Company satisfies this distribution requirement, but distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income, the Company will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, the Company will be subject to a 4% non-deductible excise tax if the actual amount paid to its shareholders in a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under U.S. federal tax laws. From time to time, the Company may generate taxable income greater than its income for financial reporting purposes, or its net taxable income may be greater than its cash flows available for distribution to its shareholders. If the Company does not have other funds available in these situations, it could be required to borrow funds, sell its securities or a portion of its properties at unfavorable prices or find other sources of funds in order to meet the REIT distribution requirements and avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax.\nIn addition, the REIT provisions of the Code impose a 100% tax on income from “prohibited transactions.” Prohibited transactions generally include sales of assets, other than foreclosure property, that constitute inventory or other property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. This 100% tax could affect the Company’s decisions to sell property if it believes such sales could be treated as a prohibited transaction. However, the Company would not be subject to this tax if it were to sell assets through a TRS. The Company will also be subject to a 100% tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements between the Company and its TRS are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties.\nChanges to the Company’s asset portfolio could exacerbate these risks.\n The Company May Be Forced to Borrow Funds to Maintain Its REIT Status, and the Unavailability of Such Capital on Favorable Terms at the Desired Times, or at All, May Cause the Company to Dispose of Assets at Inopportune Times, Which Could Materially and Adversely Affect the Company\n To qualify as a REIT, the Company generally must distribute to shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income each year, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, and the Company will be subject to regular corporate income taxes on its undistributed taxable income to the extent that the Company distributes less than 100% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains, each year. In addition, the Company will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by the Company in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of the Company’s ordinary income, 95% of its capital gain net income and 100% of its undistributed income from prior years. The Company could have a potential distribution shortfall as a result of, among other things, differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and recognition of income for U.S. federal income tax\n\npurposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. In order to maintain REIT status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, the Company may need to borrow funds to meet the REIT distribution requirements. The Company may not be able to borrow funds on favorable terms or at all, and the Company’s ability to borrow may be restricted by the terms of the instruments governing the Company’s existing indebtedness. The Company’s access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market’s perception of the value of the Company’s properties, its current debt levels, the market price of its common shares and current and potential future earnings. The Company cannot assure shareholders that it will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause the Company to dispose of assets at inopportune times and could materially and adversely affect the Company. The Company may make taxable in-kind distributions of common shares, which may cause shareholders to be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash received, or the Company may be required to withhold taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash shareholders receive.\n Dividends Paid by REITs Generally Do Not Qualify for Reduced Tax Rates\n In general, the maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for dividends paid to individual U.S. shareholders is 20%. Due to its REIT status, the Company’s distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates. However, U.S. shareholders that are individuals, trusts or estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (e.g., REIT dividends that are not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6%, assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts or estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including the per share trading price of the Company’s common shares.\n Certain Foreign Shareholders May Be Subject to U.S. Federal Income Tax on Gain Recognized on a Disposition of the Company’s Common Shares if the Company Does Not Qualify as a “Domestically Controlled” REIT\nA foreign person disposing of a U.S. real property interest, including shares of a U.S. corporation whose assets consist principally of U.S. real property interests, is generally subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain recognized on the disposition. This tax does not apply, however, to the disposition of stock in a REIT if the REIT is “domestically controlled.” In general, the Company will be a domestically controlled REIT if at all times during the five-year period ending on the applicable stockholder’s disposition of the Company’s stock, less than 50% in value of the stock was held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons. If the Company were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT, gain recognized by a foreign stockholder on a disposition of the Company’s common shares would be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the common shares were traded on an established securities market and the foreign stockholder did not at any time during a specific testing period directly or indirectly own more than 10% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.\nLegislative or Other Actions Affecting REITs Could Have a Negative Effect on the Company\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could materially and adversely affect the Company or its shareholders. The Company cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect shareholders or the Company. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the Company’s ability to qualify as a REIT, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Company. In addition, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT. Furthermore, potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementation of regulations by the Treasury and IRS, may have or may in the future occur or be enacted, and, in each case, they could lessen or increase the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”). In addition, states and localities, which often use federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities, continue to react to the TCJA, and these may exacerbate its negative, or diminish its positive, effects on the Company. It is impossible to predict the nature or extent of any new tax legislation, regulation or administrative interpretations, but such items could adversely affect the Company’s operating results, financial condition and/or future business planning.\nRisks Related to the Company’s Organization, Structure and Ownership\n Provisions of the Company’s Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations Could Have the Effect of Delaying, Deferring or Preventing a Change in Control, Even if That Change May Be Considered Beneficial by Some of the Company’s Shareholders\n The Company’s Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by the Company’s Board of Directors. Among other things, the Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations include these provisions:\n •Prohibiting any person from owning more than 9.8% of the Company’s outstanding common shares in order to maintain the Company’s status as a REIT;\n •Authorizing “blank check” preferred shares, which could be issued by the Board of Directors without shareholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the Company’s common shares;\n •Providing that any vacancy on the Board of Directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office;\n •Providing that no shareholder may cumulate the shareholder’s voting power in the election of directors; \n •Providing that shareholders may not act by written consent unless such written consent is unanimous and\n •Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of the Company’s shareholders and for nominations of candidates for election to the Board of Directors.\n These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in the Company’s management. The Company believes these provisions protect its shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and are not intended to make the Company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay, defer or prevent an acquisition that the Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of its common shares.\n The Company’s Board of Directors May Change Significant Corporate Policies Without Shareholder Approval\n The Company’s strategies and investment, financing and dividend policies will be determined by its Board of Directors. These strategies and policies may be amended or revised at any time at the discretion of the Board of Directors without a vote of the Company’s shareholders. A change in any of these strategies and policies could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common shares and on the Company’s financial condition, operating results and cash flow and on its ability to make distributions to shareholders.\nRisks Related to the Company’s Relationship with Curbline Properties\n The Company’s Relationship with Curbline Properties May Create, or Appear to Create, Conflicts of Interest\n The Company’s agreements with Curbline Properties could lead to, or appear to cause, conflicts of interest. For example, pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement, Curbline Properties provides the Company with leadership, management and transaction services, and the Company provides Curbline Properties with the services of its employees and the use or benefit of such Company assets, offices and other resources as are necessary or useful to operate Curbline Properties’ business. As a result, Company employees provide significant services to Curbline Properties, and Curbline Properties provides the Company with the services of its leadership and management personnel. As such, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with the performance of the services provided by the Company or Curbline Properties and the allocation of priority, time and attention to providing such services. In particular, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer are employed and compensated by, and also serve as the chief executive officer and chief investment officer of, Curbline Properties, and their services are provided to the Company under the terms of the Shared Services Agreement. These individuals also serve as directors of the Company and own equity in Curbline Properties which could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when these officers and the Company are faced with decisions (including with respect to the Shared Services Agreement) that could have different implications for the Company and Curbline Properties.\n\nConflicts of interest could likewise arise in connection with the exercise of rights (including termination rights) by, and resolution of any dispute among, the Company and Curbline Properties with respect to the terms of the agreements governing their separation and ongoing relationship. Conflicts of interest may also arise from the lease of vacant space or renewal of existing leases at\n\nthe Company’s properties, which may be located near and compete with properties owned by Curbline Properties. Conflicts may also arise with respect to the employment of Company personnel, as Curbline Properties is not prohibited from soliciting the employment of Company employees.\n \nThe Agreements with Curbline Properties Were Not Negotiated on an Arm’s-Length Basis and May Not Be on the Same Terms as if They Had Been Negotiated With an Unaffiliated Third Party\n The Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Shared Services Agreement and other agreements governing the Company’s ongoing relationship with Curbline Properties were negotiated between related parties and do not reflect the terms that would have been negotiated at arm’s length with an unaffiliated third party. For example, the allocation of assets, liabilities, expenses, rights, durations, indemnification and other obligations between the Company and Curbline Properties under these agreements would likely be have been different if they had been agreed to by unaffiliated parties. It is unlikely that an unaffiliated third party would be willing or able to perform certain of these agreements or provide similar services on the same terms or at all.\n\nThe Company Is Required to Provide Services and Certain Benefits to Curbline Properties for the Duration of the Shared Services Agreement, Even If it is Economically Inefficient to do so\n  Pursuant to the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, until October 1, 2027, the Company is generally obligated to provide Curbline Properties with the services of the Company’s employees and the use or benefit of such of the Company’s assets, offices and other resources as may be necessary or useful for Curbline Properties to establish and operate various business functions in a manner as would be established and operated for a REIT similarly situated to Curbline Properties. As a result of these obligations, even if future sales of Company assets cause a significant decrease in the size of the Company’s portfolio, the Company may have limited ability to proportionately reduce the size of its organization and general and administrative expense during the term of the Shared Services Agreement. While Curbline Properties is required to pay certain fees to the Company pursuant to the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, these fees are not expected to fully offset the cost of the services and benefits the Company is required to provide to Curbline Properties during the term of the agreement. As a result, the costs incurred by the Company to satisfy its obligations to Curbline Properties during the term of the Shared Services Agreement are likely to have an increasingly disproportionate and adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and its ability to use operating cash flows to make distributions to shareholders.\n \nRisks Related to the Company’s Common Shares\n Changes in Market Conditions Could Adversely Affect the Market Price of the Company’s Publicly Traded Securities\n As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of the Company’s publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time to time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of the Company’s publicly traded securities are the following:\n •The extent of institutional investor interest in the Company and the properties it owns;\n •The reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with similar portfolios;\n •The attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies or sovereign governments), bank deposits or other investments;\n •The Company’s financial condition and performance; \n •The market’s perception of the Company’s strategy, the value of its properties and its future cash dividends;\n •An increase in market interest rates, which could adversely impact the value of the Company’s properties or may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for the Company’s shares and\n •General economic and financial market conditions.\n The Company May Issue Additional Securities Without Shareholder Approval\n The Company can issue preferred shares and common shares without shareholder approval subject to certain limitations in the Company’s Articles of Incorporation. Holders of preferred shares have priority over holders of common shares, and the issuance of additional shares reduces the ownership interest of existing holders in the Company.\nGeneral Risks Relating to Investments in the Company’s Securities\n The Company May Be Unable to Retain and Attract Key Management Personnel\n The Company may be unable to retain and attract talented executives. Pursuant to the terms of the Shared Services Agreement, Curbline Properties currently provides the Company with our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer and therefore these officers are not employed by, or exclusively dedicated to, the Company. In the event of the loss of key management personnel, the Company may not be able to find replacements with comparable skill, ability and industry expertise. The Company’s operating results and financial condition and the market price of the Company’s common shares could be materially and adversely affected until suitable replacements are identified and retained, if at all.\nThe Company Is Subject to Litigation That Could Adversely Affect Its Results of Operations\n The Company is a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Any such litigation could also lead to increased volatility of the trading price of the Company’s common shares. For a further discussion of litigation risks, see “Legal Matters” in Note 8, “Commitments and Contingencies,” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.",
