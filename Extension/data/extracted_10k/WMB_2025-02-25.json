      "text": "Item 1. Business\nThis report includes information for multiple registrants, specifically The Williams Companies, Inc. (Williams), as well as Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) and Northwest Pipeline LLC (NWP) both of which are wholly owned subsidiaries of Williams (collectively, the Registrants). References to subsidiaries by name, including equity-method investees, Transco, and NWP, refer exclusively to those businesses and operations.\nGeneral\nWilliams is an energy company committed to being the leader in providing infrastructure that safely delivers natural gas products to reliably fuel the clean energy economy. Williams has operations in 12 supply areas that provide natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission services; NGLs fractionation, transportation, and storage services; and marketing services to approximately 800 customers. Williams owns an interest in and operates over 33,000 miles of pipelines in 24 states, 34 natural gas processing facilities, 9 NGL fractionation facilities, approximately 25 million barrels of NGL storage capacity, and 417 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity, and delivers natural gas that is used every day for clean-power generation, heating, and industrial use. \nWilliams was founded in 1908, originally incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada in 1949 and reincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1987. Its common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WMB.” Its operations are located in the United States. Williams’ headquarters are located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with other major offices in Houston, Texas; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Salt Lake City, Utah.\nTransco owns and operates an approximately 9,700-mile natural gas pipeline system extending from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and the Gulf of America through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey to the New York City metropolitan area. The system serves customers in Texas and the 12 southeast and Atlantic seaboard states mentioned above, including major metropolitan areas in Georgia, Washington D.C., Maryland, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Transco’s principal business is the interstate transportation of natural gas, which is regulated by the FERC.\nNWP owns and operates an approximately 3,900-mile natural gas pipeline system, extending from the San Juan basin in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado through Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to a point on the Canadian border near Sumas, Washington. The system serves customers in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, California, and Arizona, either directly or indirectly through interconnections with other pipelines. NWP’s principal business is the interstate transportation of natural gas, which is regulated by FERC.\nService Assets, Customers, and Contracts\nKey variables for Williams’ businesses will continue to be: \n•Obstacles to Williams’ expansion efforts, including delays or denials of necessary permits and opposition to hydrocarbon-based energy development;\n•Producer drilling activities impacting natural gas supplies supporting Williams’ gathering and processing volumes;\n•Retaining and attracting customers by continuing to provide reliable services;\n•Revenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either completed or currently under construction;\n•Prices impacting Williams’ commodity-based activities; \n•Disciplined growth in Williams’ service areas. \nInterstate Natural Gas Pipeline Assets\nWilliams’ interstate natural gas pipelines, which are presented in the Transmission & Gulf of America segment as described under the heading “Business Segments,” are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such, rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce are subject to regulation. The rates are established primarily through the FERC’s ratemaking process, but rates may also be negotiated with customers pursuant to the terms of tariffs and FERC policy.\nWilliams’ interstate natural gas pipelines transport and store natural gas for a broad mix of customers, including local natural gas distribution companies, public utilities, municipalities, direct industrial users, electric power generators, and natural gas marketers and producers. Most of Williams’ interstate natural gas transmission businesses are fully contracted under long-term firm reservation contracts with high credit quality customers. These contracts have various expiration dates and account for the major portion of these regulated businesses. Additionally, Williams offers storage services and interruptible transportation services under shorter-term agreements. The top ten customers of the interstate natural gas pipelines in 2024 accounted for approximately 45 percent of Williams’ regulated interstate natural gas transportation and storage revenues.\nTransco’s three largest customers in 2024 accounted for approximately 20 percent of Transco’s total operating revenues. Transco’s firm transportation agreements are generally long-term agreements with various expiration dates and account for the major portion of its business.\nDuring 2024, NWP’s three largest customers were Puget Sound Energy, Inc., Cascade Natural Gas Corporation, and Northwest Natural Gas Company, which accounted for approximately 31 percent, 10 percent, and 11 percent, respectively, of NWP total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of NWP total operating revenues during that period.\nNatural Gas Gathering and Processing Assets\nWilliams’ gathering, processing, and treating operations are presented within the Transmission & Gulf of America, Northeast G&P, and West reporting segments as described under the heading “Business Segments.”\nWilliams’ gathering systems receive natural gas from producers’ crude oil and natural gas wells and gather these volumes to gas processing, treating, or redelivery facilities. Typically, natural gas, in its raw form, is not acceptable for transportation in major interstate natural gas pipelines or for commercial use as a fuel. Williams’ treating facilities remove water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other contaminants, and collect condensate. Williams is generally paid a fee based on the volume of natural gas gathered and/or treated, generally measured in the Btu heating value.\nIn addition, natural gas contains various amounts of NGLs, which generally have a higher value when separated from the natural gas stream. Williams’ processing plants extract the NGLs, which include ethane, primarily used in the petrochemical industry; propane, used for heating, fuel, and also in the petrochemical industry; and, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline, primarily used by the refining industry.\nWilliams’ gas processing services generate revenues primarily from the following types of contracts:\n•Fee-based: A cash fee is received based on the volume of natural gas processed, generally measured in the Btu heating value. A portion of Williams’ fee-based processing revenue includes a share of the margins on the NGLs produced. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 95 percent of NGL production volumes were under fee-based contracts.\n•Noncash commodity-based: Gas is also processed under two types of commodity-based contracts, keep-whole and percent-of-liquids, where consideration for services is received in the form of NGLs. For a keep-whole arrangement Williams replaces the Btu content of the retained NGLs with natural gas purchases, also known as shrink replacement gas. For a percent-of-liquids arrangement, Williams delivers an agreed-upon percentage of the extracted NGLs and retains the remainder. Retained NGLs, referred to as equity NGL production, are then sold. Per-unit NGL margins are calculated based on sales of these equity volumes at the processing plants. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 5 percent of NGL production volumes were under noncash commodity-based contracts. \nGenerally, Williams’ gathering and processing agreements are long-term agreements, with terms ranging from month-to-month to the life of the producing lease. Certain contracts include cost-of-service mechanisms that are designed to support a return on invested capital and allow gathering rates to be adjusted, subject to specified caps in certain cases, to account for variability in volume, capital expenditures, commodity price fluctuations, compression, and other expenses. Williams also has certain gas gathering and processing agreements with MVC, whereby the customer is obligated to pay a contractually determined fee based on any shortfall between the actual gathered and processed volumes and the MVC for a stated period.\nDemand for gas gathering and processing services is dependent on producers’ drilling activities, which is impacted by the strength of the economy, commodity prices, and the resulting demand for natural gas by manufacturing and industrial companies and consumers. Williams’ gathering, processing, and treating businesses do not have direct exposure to crude oil prices. Williams’ on-shore natural gas gathering and processing businesses are substantially focused on gas-directed drilling basins rather than crude oil, with a broad diversity of basins and customers served. Declines in crude oil drilling would be expected to result in less associated natural gas production, which could drive more demand for natural gas produced from gas-directed basins served. \nDuring 2024, Williams’ facilities gathered and processed gas for approximately 248 customers. The top ten customers accounted for approximately 59 percent of gathering and processing fee revenues and NGL margins from noncash commodity-based agreements. Williams believes counterparty credit concerns in its gathering and processing businesses are significantly mitigated by the physical nature of Williams’ services, where gathering occurs at the wellhead and therefore is critical to a producer’s ability to move product to market.\nGas and NGL Marketing\nWilliams’ natural gas and NGL marketing services are presented primarily within its Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment. Williams markets natural gas and NGL products to a wide range of users in the energy and petrochemical industries. In 2024, the three largest natural gas marketing customers accounted for approximately 10 percent of Williams’ gross natural gas marketing sales, and the three largest NGL marketing customers accounted for approximately 37 percent of Williams’ NGL marketing sales.\nWilliams’ gas marketing business markets natural gas and provides natural gas asset management and wholesale marketing, trading, storage, and transportation for a diverse set of natural gas and electric utilities, municipalities, power generators, and producers, including for Williams’ upstream properties. Additionally, Williams’ gas marketing business moves and optimizes natural gas to markets through transportation and storage agreements on Williams’ own strategically positioned assets. Williams’ gas and NGL marketing services provide customers with access to diverse sources of supply and to various natural gas demand markets, including the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions which are the fastest growing natural gas demand regions in the United States. \nWilliams purchases natural gas for storage when the current market price paid to buy and transport natural gas plus the cost to store and finance the natural gas is less than an estimated, forward market price that can be received in the future, resulting in positive net product sales. Commodity-based exchange-traded futures contracts and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are used to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the stored natural gas is sold. Additionally, Williams enters into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve Williams’ customers and various markets. Commodity-based exchange-traded futures contracts and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity in order to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between receipt and delivery points occurs. \nMonthly demand charges incurred for the contracted storage and transportation capacity and payments associated with asset management agreements are substantially indirectly reimbursed by customers. As Williams is acting as an agent, natural gas marketing revenues are presented net of the related costs of those activities. In addition, all of Williams’ natural gas marketing derivative activities qualify as held for trading purposes, which requires net presentation in Williams Consolidated Statement of Income.\nWilliams’ NGL marketing business transports and markets equity NGLs from the production at Williams’ processing plants, NGLs from the production at Williams’ upstream properties, and also NGLs on behalf of third-party NGL producers, including some of our fee-based processing customers, as well as the NGL volumes owned by certain of Williams’ equity-method investments. The NGL marketing business bears the risk of price changes in these NGL volumes while they are being transported to final sales delivery points. In order to meet sales contract obligations, Williams may purchase products in the spot market for resale.\nWilliams is exposed to commodity price risk. To manage this volatility, various contracts are used in the marketing and trading activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. Williams enters into commodity-related derivatives to hedge exposures to natural gas and NGLs and retain exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect results of operations.\nWilliams experiences significant earnings volatility from the fair value accounting required for the derivatives used to hedge a portion of the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio as well as upstream related production. However, the unrealized fair value measurement gains and losses are generally offset by valuation changes in the economic value of the underlying production or transportation and storage contracts, which is not recognized until the underlying transaction occurs.\nCrude Oil Transportation and Production Handling Assets\nWilliams’ crude oil transportation operations, which are primarily presented in the Transmission & Gulf of America segment as described under the heading “Business Segments,” earn revenues primarily from a combination of fixed-monthly fees, contractual fixed or variable fees applied to production volumes, and contributions in aid of \nconstruction (CIAC) arrangements. Generally, fixed-monthly fees associated with production handling and export revenues are recognized on a units-of-production basis utilizing either contractually determined maximum daily quantities or expected remaining production. CIAC arrangements are recognized on a units of production basis, utilizing expected remaining production. Williams’ crude oil transportation business is supported mostly by major oil producers with long-cycle perspectives. \nStandalone, Market-Based Rate Natural Gas Storage Assets\nWilliams’ standalone, market-based rate natural gas storage assets are presented in the Transmission & Gulf of America segment as described under the heading “Business Segments” and include Williams’ North Texas Assets (NorTex) acquired in August 2022 and Williams’ Gulf Coast storage assets acquired in January 2024. These natural gas storage assets provide natural gas storage services in interstate commerce under the jurisdiction of the FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act or Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act. Williams is authorized to charge and collect market-based rates for all of the services that these natural gas storage assets provide. \nWilliams stores natural gas for a broad mix of customers, including local natural gas distribution companies, public utilities, municipalities, direct industrial users, electric power generators, and natural gas marketers and producers. Most of these natural gas storage businesses are fully contracted under long-term firm reservation contracts with high credit quality customers. The contracts have various expiration dates and account for the major portion of the entities’ businesses. The three largest customers of this business in 2024 accounted for approximately 21 percent of its total operating revenues.\nBusiness Segments\nConsistent with the manner in which Williams’ chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources, Williams’ operations are conducted, managed, and presented in Part I of this Annual Report within the following reportable segments: Transmission & Gulf of America, Northeast G&P, West, and Gas & NGL Marketing Services.

For a discussion of ongoing expansion projects, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTransmission & Gulf of America\nInterstate Natural Gas Pipeline Assets\nTransco\nAt December 31, 2024, Transco’s system had a design capacity totaling approximately 19.8 MMdth/d. During 2024, Transco began full service on the Regional Energy Access expansion project which added approximately 0.4 MMdth/d of firm transportation capacity to its pipeline, partial early service on the Southside Reliability Enhancement expansion project which added approximately 0.4 MMdth/d of firm transportation capacity, and full service on Carolina Market Link expansion project which added approximately 0.1 MMdth/d of firm transportation capacity. In addition, a reduction of approximately 0.1 MMdth/d of firm transportation capacity is attributable to unsubscribed capacity as well as a reduction of approximately 0.1 MMdth/d of firm transportation capacity is attributable to termination of interim service related to the Regional Energy Access expansion project. Transco’s system includes 61 compressor stations, four underground storage fields, and one LNG storage facility. Compression facilities at sea level-rated capacity total approximately 2.6 million horsepower.\nTransco has natural gas storage capacity in four underground storage fields located on or near its pipeline system or market areas and operates two of these storage fields. Transco also has storage capacity in an LNG storage facility that it owns and operates. The total usable gas storage capacity available to Transco and its customers in such underground storage fields and LNG storage facility and through storage service contracts is approximately 188 Bcf of natural gas. At December 31, 2024, Transco’s customers had stored in its facilities approximately 137 Bcf of natural gas. Storage capacity permits Transco’s customers to inject gas into storage during the summer and off-peak periods for delivery during peak winter demand periods.\nNWP\nAt December 31, 2024, NWP’s system had a design capacity totaling approximately 3.8 MMdth/d. NWP’s system includes 42 transmission compressor stations having a combined sea level-rated capacity of approximately 476,000 horsepower. \nNWP owns a one-third undivided interest in the Jackson Prairie underground storage facility in Washington. NWP also owns and operates an LNG storage facility in Washington. These storage facilities have an aggregate working natural gas storage capacity of approximately 10 Bcf. NWP also contracts for natural gas storage services for approximately 3 Bcf at the Clay basin underground storage reservoir with a Williams’ affiliate, MountainWest. These natural gas storage facilities, which are substantially utilized for third-party natural gas, enable NWP to balance daily receipts and deliveries and provide storage services to customers.\nMountainWest Acquisition\nOn February 14, 2023, Williams closed on the acquisition of 100 percent of MountainWest Pipelines Holding Company. MountainWest is an interstate natural gas transmission company that owns and operates an approximately 2,000-mile natural gas pipeline system which is regulated by the FERC. At December 31, 2024, MountainWest’s system has a design capacity totaling 8.0 MMdth/d. The system is comprised of MountainWest Pipeline, LLC; MountainWest Overthrust Pipeline, LLC; a 50 percent equity-method interest in White River Hub, LLC; and 64 Bcf of natural gas storage capacity, including the Clay basin underground storage reservoir in Utah. During 2024, MountainWest increased its natural gas storage capacity at the Clay basin underground storage reservoir by \napproximately 8 Bcf. MountainWest is located in the Rocky Mountains near six producing areas, including the Greater Green River basin in Wyoming, the Uinta basin in Utah, and the Piceance basin in Colorado. \nGulfstream\nWilliams owns a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, a 745-mile interstate natural gas pipeline system extending from the Mobile Bay area in Alabama to markets in Florida, which has a capacity to transport 1.4 Bcf/d. Operating responsibilities for Gulfstream are shared with the other 50 percent owner.\nStandalone, Market-Based Rate Natural Gas Storage Assets\nGulf Coast Storage Acquisition\nOn January 3, 2024, Williams closed on the Gulf Coast Storage Acquisition. At December 31, 2024, these assets include a strategic portfolio of approximately 230 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines and six underground storage facilities with a capacity of approximately 118 Bcf of natural gas storage across Louisiana and Mississippi and direct access to LNG export facilities and interstate pipelines.

The listed inlet capacity of 0.6 Bcf/d is incremental capacity to the Cardinal gathering capacity of 0.7 Bcf/d.\n(3)Includes 100 percent of the statistics associated with operated equity-method investments.\nOther NGL Operations\nAs part of its Northeast G&P business, Williams owns and operates a 43 Mbbls/d NGL fractionation facility at Moundsville, West Virginia, nearby condensate stabilization facilities capable of handling approximately 17 Mbbls/d of field condensate, a de-ethanization facility at its Oak Grove processing plant, an ethane pipeline, and an NGL pipeline. The Oak Grove de-ethanizer is capable of handling up to approximately 80 Mbbls/d of mixed NGLs to extract up to approximately 40 Mbbls/d of ethane. Williams also owns and operates a 135 Mbbls/d NGL fractionation facility and approximately 970,000 barrels of NGL storage capacity in Harrison County, Ohio, as well as 44 Mbbls/d of condensate stabilization capacity, and other ancillary assets, including loading and terminal facilities in Harrison, Carroll, and Columbiana Counties, Ohio.\nNGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream in Williams’ Oak Grove and Fort Beeler cryogenic processing plants. Ethane produced at the Oak Grove de-ethanizer is transported to markets via its 50-mile ethane pipeline to Houston, Pennsylvania. The remaining mixed NGL stream from the de-ethanizer is then transported via Williams’ \n50-mile NGL pipeline and fractionated at either its Moundsville or Harrison fractionation facility. The resulting products are then transported on truck, rail, or pipeline. Ohio Valley Midstream provides residue natural gas take away options for customers with interconnections to three interstate transmission pipelines.\nCertain Equity-Method Investments\nAppalachia Midstream Investments\nThrough the Appalachia Midstream Investments, Williams operates and owns an approximate average 66 percent interest in the Bradford Supply Hub gathering system and owns an approximate average 68 percent interest in the Marcellus South gathering system, together which consist of approximately 1,050 miles of gathering pipeline in the Marcellus Shale region with the capacity to gather 5,700 MMcf/d of natural gas. The majority of Williams’ volumes in the region are gathered from northern Pennsylvania, southwestern Pennsylvania, and the northwestern panhandle of West Virginia in core areas of the Marcellus Shale. Williams operates the assets primarily under long-term, 100 percent fixed-fee gathering agreements that include significant acreage dedications. Additionally, some Marcellus South agreements have MVCs.\nLaurel Mountain\nWilliams operates and owns a 69 percent interest in a joint venture, Laurel Mountain, which includes a 1,147-mile gathering system in western Pennsylvania with the capacity to gather 0.9 Bcf/d of natural gas. Laurel Mountain has a long-term, dedicated, volumetric-based fee agreement, with exposure to natural gas prices, to gather the anchor customer’s production in the western Pennsylvania area of the Marcellus Shale. Additionally, certain Laurel Mountain agreements have MVCs.\nBlue Racer\nWilliams operates and owns a 50 percent interest in Blue Racer. Blue Racer is a joint venture to own, operate, develop, and acquire midstream assets in the Utica Shale and certain adjacent areas in the Marcellus Shale.

It also includes crude oil storage and compression assets.\nTrace Acquisition\nOn April 29, 2022, Williams closed on the acquisition of 100 percent of Gemini Arklatex, LLC, through which the gas gathering and related assets of Trace Midstream were acquired. The purpose of this acquisition was to expand Williams’ footprint into the east Texas area of the Haynesville Shale region, increasing in-basin scale.\nOther NGL Operations\nWilliams owns interests in and/or operates NGL fractionation and storage assets in central Kansas near Conway. These assets include a 50 percent interest in an NGL fractionation facility with capacity of slightly more than 100 Mbbls/d and also approximately 23 million barrels of NGL storage capacity. In addition, Williams owns a 189-mile NGL pipeline from a fractionator near Conway, Kansas, to an interconnection with a third-party NGL pipeline system in Oklahoma.\nOverland Pass Pipeline Equity-Method Investment\nWilliams operates and owns a 50 percent interest in OPPL. OPPL is capable of transporting 245 Mbbls/d of NGLs and includes 1,035 miles of NGL pipeline extending from Opal, Wyoming, to the Mid-Continent NGL market center near Conway, Kansas, along with extensions into the Piceance and DJ basins in Colorado and the Bakken Shale in the Williston basin in North Dakota. The equity NGL volumes from Williams’ Wyoming plants as well as certain Colorado plants are dedicated for transport on OPPL under long-term transportation agreements.\nWest Operating Statistics\n\n2024                                                                           2023                    2022\n                                                                                   (Annual Average Amounts)\nConsolidated:                                                                                              \nGathering volumes (Bcf/d) (1)                      5.46                    6.02                    5.19    \nPlant inlet natural gas volumes (Bcf/d)            1.54                    1.54                    1.15    \nNGL production (Mbbls/d)                             90                      91                      43    \nNGL equity sales (Mbbls/d)                            7                      14                      14    \nNon-Consolidated: (2)                                                                                      \nGathering volumes (Bcf/d)                             —                       —                    0.29    \nPlant inlet natural gas volumes (Bcf/d)               —                       —                    0.28    \nNGL production (Mbbls/d)                              —                       —                      33    \n________________\n(1)    Includes volumes for gathering assets acquired in the Trace Acquisition after the purchase on April 29, 2022 as well as volumes for gathering assets acquired in the DJ Basin Acquisitions after the purchase on November 30, 2023.

Williams had an agreement regarding these properties in which it owned 75 percent of the venture’s undivided interest in each well’s working interest. In November 2024, Williams closed on the acquisition of the third-party operator Crowheart Energy, LLC. After closing on the acquisition Williams is the operator and owns more than a 90 percent working interest in each well. \nCertain natural gas properties in Louisiana were transferred to Williams in November 2020 as part of a bankruptcy resolution with a customer. In the third quarter of 2021, Williams sold 50 percent of the existing wells and wellbore rights in the South Mansfield area of the Haynesville Shale region to a third party operator, in a strategic effort to develop the acreage, thereby enhancing the value of Williams midstream natural gas infrastructure. Under the agreement, the third party operates the upstream position and develops the undeveloped acreage. The third-party’s interest in new wells increased to 75 percent in early 2023 when a certain drilling hurdle was met. Williams retained ownership in the undeveloped acreage until a separate acreage earning hurdle was met in the fourth quarter of 2023, at which time remaining undeveloped acreage was conveyed to the third party resulting in the third party owning 75 percent and Williams owning 25 percent.\nOperating Statistics\n\n                                     2024 (1)                    2023                    2022\n                                                                     (Annual Average Amounts)\nNet Product Sales Volumes:                                                                   \nNatural Gas (Bcf/d)                 0.31                     0.29                    0.22    \nNGLs (Mbbls/d)                        11                        7                       7    \nCrude Oil (Mbbls/d)                    6                        4                       2    \n________________\n(1)    Includes volumes for the Crowheart Acquisition after the purchase on November 1, 2024. Further, the amounts for the acquired assets are averaged over the period owned, not over the entire year.\nNew Energy Ventures\nWilliams’ Other segment also includes investments in certain new energy ventures related to hydrogen, solar, renewable natural gas, and NextGen Gas. NextGen Gas is natural gas that has been independently certified as low emissions gas across all segments of the value chain.\nRate Matters\nFERC regulation requires all terms and conditions of service, including the rates charged, to be filed with and accepted by the FERC before any changes can go into effect. Our interstate natural gas pipelines establish their rates primarily through the FERC’s ratemaking process, but also may negotiate rates with their customers pursuant to the terms of their tariff and FERC policy. Key determinants in the ratemaking process are: (1) costs of providing service, including depreciation expense; (2) allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the capital structure and related income taxes; and (3) contract and volume throughput assumptions. The allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate design and the allocation of costs between the reservation and commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of rate case proceedings, certain revenues may be collected subject to refund. Estimates of rate refund liabilities may be recorded considering their and third-party regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and other risks.\nConsistent with FERC policy, our interstate natural gas pipelines design their rates using the straight fixed-variable (SFV) method of rate design. Under the SFV method of rate design, substantially all fixed costs, including \nreturn on equity and income taxes, are included in a reservation charge to customers and all variable costs are recovered through a commodity charge to customers. While the use of SFV rate design limits our pipelines’ opportunity to earn incremental revenues through increased throughput, it also limits their risk associated with fluctuations in throughput.\nTransco Rate Case Filing\nOn August 30, 2024, Transco filed a general rate case with the FERC for an overall increase in rates. In September 2024, with the exception of certain rates that reflected a rate decrease, the FERC accepted and suspended our general rate filing to be effective March 1, 2025, subject to refund and the outcome of hearing procedures established by the FERC. The specific rates that reflected a rate decrease were accepted, without suspension, to be effective October 1, 2024, as requested by Transco, and will not be subject to refund. The impact of the rates reflecting a rate decrease is expected to reduce revenues by approximately $1 million per month beginning October 1, 2024.\nNWP Rate Case Settlement\nOn November 15, 2022, the FERC approved NWP’s Petition for Approval of Pre-Filing Stipulation and Settlement Agreement (Settlement) in Docket No. RP22-1155. The Settlement established a new general system firm Rate Schedule TF-1 (Large Customer) daily reservation rate of $0.37250/Dth with a $0.00935/Dth commodity rate (which were made effective January 1, 2023), resolved other rate issues, established a Modernization and Emission Reduction Program and satisfied our rate case filing obligation under our settlement in Docket No. RP17-346. Provisions were included in the Settlement that establish a moratorium on any NGA Section 4 or 5 proceedings that would seek to place new rates in effect any earlier than January 1, 2026. The Settlement also provides that Northwest Pipeline file an NGA Section 4 general rate case with rates to be effective not later than April 1, 2028, unless (a) Northwest Pipeline has entered into a pre-filing settlement or (b) a Section 5 general rate case has been filed on or before April 1, 2028. \nAs a result of the Settlement, in January 2023, NWP refunded approximately $126 million, including interest, associated with the decrease in federal tax rates due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform), which reduced current Regulatory liabilities on NWP’s Balance Sheet.\nRegulatory Matters \nFERC\nWilliams’ natural gas pipeline interstate transmission and storage activities, including activities of Transco and NWP, are subject to FERC regulation under the NGA and under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, as amended, and, as such, the rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, accounting, and the extension, enlargement, or abandonment of the jurisdictional facilities, among other things, are subject to regulation. Each of Williams’ natural gas pipeline companies, including Transco and NWP, holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines, facilities, and properties for which certificates are required under the NGA. FERC Standards of Conduct govern how the interstate pipelines communicate and conduct transmission transactions with an affiliate that engages in marketing functions. Among other things, the Standards of Conduct require that interstate gas pipelines treat all transmission customers, affiliated and non-affiliated, on a not unduly discriminatory basis. FERC Standards of Conduct govern the relationship between natural gas transmission providers and marketing function employees as defined by the rule. The Standards of Conduct are intended to prevent natural gas transmission providers from preferentially benefiting gas marketing functions by requiring the employees of a transmission provider that perform transmission functions to function independently from marketing function employees and by restricting the information that transmission providers may provide to marketing function employees. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC is authorized to impose civil penalties of more than $1.5 million per day for each violation of its rules.\nFERC regulation requires all terms and conditions of service, including the rates charged, to be filed with and accepted by the FERC before any changes can go into effect. Williams’ interstate gas pipeline companies, including \nTransco and NWP, establish rates through the FERC’s ratemaking process. In addition, Williams’ interstate gas pipelines, including Transco and NWP, may enter into agreements with customers for negotiated rates, which may be less than, equal to, or greater than the otherwise applicable cost-based recourse rates. Williams, including Transco, has also received authority to charge market-based rates for certain of our storage services. Key determinants in the FERC ratemaking process include:\n•Costs of providing service, including depreciation expense;\n•Allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the capital structure and related income taxes;\n•Contract and volume throughput assumptions.\nThe allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate design and the allocation of costs between the reservation and commodity rates also impact profitability. During the pendency of rate case proceedings, certain revenues collected may be subject to refund.\nWilliams also owns interests in and operates natural gas liquids pipelines that are regulated by various federal and state governmental agencies. Services provided on the interstate natural gas liquids pipelines are subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act by the FERC, which has authority over the terms and conditions of service; rates, including depreciation and amortization policies; and initiation of service. Williams’ intrastate natural gas liquids pipelines providing common carrier service are subject to regulation by various state regulatory agencies. \nUpdated Certificate Policy Statement and Interim Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Policy Statement\nOn February 18, 2022, the FERC issued an Updated Certificate Policy Statement and an Interim GHG Policy Statement, which were to provide guidance for consideration of interstate natural gas pipeline projects. The Updated Certificate Policy Statement was intended to provide an analytical framework for how the FERC would consider whether a project is in the public convenience and necessity. The Interim GHG Policy Statement was intended to set forth how the FERC would assess the impacts of natural gas infrastructure projects on climate change in its reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act and the NGA. On March 24, 2022, the FERC converted the Updated Certificate Policy Statement and the Interim GHG Policy Statement into draft policy statements, and on January 24, 2025, the FERC terminated the Interim GHG Policy Statement proceeding. The FERC has not yet issued final guidance on the Updated Certificate Policy Statement.\nPipeline Safety\nWilliams’ interstate natural gas pipelines, including Transco and NWP, are subject to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Jobs Creation Act of 2011, and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 and 2020, which regulate safety requirements in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities. The United States Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) administers federal pipeline safety laws.\nFederal pipeline safety laws authorize PHMSA to establish minimum safety standards for pipeline facilities and persons engaged in the transportation of gas or hazardous liquids by pipeline. These safety standards apply to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of gas and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities affecting interstate or foreign commerce. PHMSA has also established reporting requirements for operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities, as well as provisions for establishing the qualification of pipeline personnel and requirements for managing the integrity of gas transmission and distribution lines and certain hazardous liquid pipelines. To ensure compliance with these provisions, PHMSA performs pipeline safety inspections and has the authority to initiate enforcement actions.\nIn August 2022, PHMSA published Rule 2, which is the last in the three-part Mega Rule set of regulations. Rule 2 went into effect in May 2023, but a Stay of Enforcement until February 2024 limited the amount of the regulation that was implemented. Since the rule was published in 2022, Williams, including Transco and NWP, has worked to understand the regulatory changes and modify procedures as needed and will continue to monitor impacts, if any, from recently published amendments. \nPipeline Integrity Regulations\nWilliams has an enterprise-wide Gas Integrity Management Plan, which includes Transco and NWP, that meets the PHMSA final rule issued pursuant to the requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. To meet the PHMSA regulations, Williams has identified all pipelines in high consequence areas (HCAs) and developed baseline assessment plans for all applicable pipelines. In response to the PHMSA Mega Rule, implemented in 2021, Williams identified Moderate Consequence Areas, and integrated those segments into its integrity program along with Class 3 and 4 pipeline locations required by the rule. \nRegulatory changes as part of the Mega Rule, effective in 2024, impose stricter requirements for repairing crack-like, dent, and metal loss features. This has led to increased remediation efforts and higher costs compared to previous years. Additionally, advancements in identifying, evaluating, and remediating hard spot defects have contributed to higher spending.\nWilliams estimates that the cost to be incurred in 2025 with its entire Gas Integrity Management program to be approximately $219 million, which includes $168 million and $38 million for Transco and NWP, respectively. Management considers these costs to be prudent and incurred in the ordinary course of business and, the maintenance capital costs to be recoverable through rate case filings by Williams’ interstate pipelines.\nWilliams also has an enterprise-wide Liquid Integrity Management Plan that meets PHMSA requirements including HCA identification and a baseline assessment plan. Williams estimates that the cost to be incurred in 2025 associated with this program will be approximately $2 million. Williams considers these costs to be prudent and incurred in the ordinary course of business.\nCybersecurity Matters \nIn 2024, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued two updated security directives to further enhance cybersecurity resilience for pipeline operators. Security Directive Pipeline-2021-01D, effective May 29, 2024, continues to require owners/operators of critical pipelines to: (1) report cybersecurity incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 24 hours; (2) designate a Cybersecurity Coordinator available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to coordinate cybersecurity practices and incident responses; and (3) conduct comprehensive reviews of cybersecurity practices, identify gaps, and report results to TSA and CISA. \nAdditionally, Security Directive Pipeline-2021-02E, effective July 27, 2024, builds on previous directives by requiring pipeline operators to: (1) implement a TSA-approved Cybersecurity Implementation Plan, incorporating network segmentation, continuous monitoring, and access control measures; (2) develop and maintain a robust Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan to reduce risks to critical systems during an incident; and (3) establish a Cybersecurity Assessment Plan with annual updates and reports to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented measures and identify vulnerabilities. \nWilliams, including Transco and NWP, has established and received TSA approval for its Cybersecurity Implementation Plan and Cybersecurity Assessment Plan, and is compliant with the remaining requirements established in Security Directives 1D and 2E.\nAdditionally, the United States Coast Guard issued a final rule in January 2025, establishing baseline cybersecurity requirements for maritime transportation assets, including vessels and facilities regulated under the Maritime Transportation Security Act. This rule mandates the development and maintenance of a Cybersecurity Plan, designation of a Cybersecurity Officer, implementation of security measures for account, device, and data protection, regular cybersecurity assessments, and reporting of cyber incidents. Compliance timelines for these requirements are phased, with key milestones such as cybersecurity assessments and plan submissions required within 24 months of the rule’s effective date.\nWilliams is actively monitoring evolving regulatory requirements to ensure compliance across its operations, including Transco and NWP. Williams is assessing the applicability of various regulations to its assets and implementing necessary measures to align with these standards. Williams, including Transco and NWP,  remains \ncommitted to safeguarding its infrastructure, minimizing risks, and maintaining the resilience of its operations in the face of evolving cybersecurity threats \nSee Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” — “A breach of information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on Williams, Transco, or NWP, or the third parties with whom they are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and cause reputational harm.”\nGathering Regulations\nWilliams’ onshore midstream gathering operations are subject to laws and regulations in the various states in which it operates. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission has the authority to regulate the terms of service for Williams’ intrastate natural gas gathering business in Texas. Although the applicable state regulations vary widely, they generally require that pipeline rates and practices be reasonable and nondiscriminatory, and may include provisions covering marketing, pricing, pollution, environment, and human health and safety. Some states, such as New York and Ohio, have specific regulations pertaining to the design, construction, and operations of gathering lines within such state. \nWilliams has been actively implementing PHMSA’s 2021 Gas Gathering final rule that requires all onshore gas gathering lines to report incidents and file annual reports. The final rule also established a new Type C regulated gathering line and now requires Type C gathering lines to comply with specifically identified PHMSA regulations in 49 Code of Federal Regulations Part 192. Since the rule was published, Williams has worked to understand the regulatory changes and modify our procedures as needed.\nLiquids Pipelines\nWilliams’ liquids pipelines are regulated by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, the Texas Railroad Commission, and various other state and federal agencies. These pipelines are also subject to the liquid pipeline safety and integrity regulations discussed above since both Louisiana and Texas have adopted the integrity management regulations defined in PHMSA.\nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act\nWilliams’ offshore gas and liquids pipelines located on the outer continental shelf, including Transco, are subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which provides in part that outer continental shelf pipelines “must provide open and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and non-owner shippers.”\nSee Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” — “The operation of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses or customers,” and “The natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return.”\nEnvironmental Matters \nWilliams’ operations, including Transco and NWP, are subject to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the state, local, and tribal laws and regulations adopted by the jurisdictions in which they operate. Williams, Transco, and NWP could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as liability for cleanup costs. Materials could be released into the environment in several ways including, but not limited to:\n•Leakage from gathering systems, underground gas storage caverns, pipelines, processing or treating facilities, transportation facilities, and storage tanks;\n•Damage to facilities resulting from accidents during normal operations;\n•Damages to onshore and offshore equipment and facilities resulting from storm events or natural disasters;\n•Blowouts, cratering, and explosions.\nIn addition, Williams, Transco, and NWP may be liable for environmental damage caused by former owners or operators of our properties.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP believe compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on their capital expenditures, earnings, or current competitive position. However, environmental laws and regulations could affect their business in various ways from time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance expenditures, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses.\nNWP - Washington State Climate Commitment Act\nIn 2021, the state of Washington passed its Climate Commitment Act establishing a market-based cap-and-invest program to reduce carbon emissions. This program took effect on January 1, 2023, and sets a limit, or cap, on overall carbon emissions in the state and requires businesses like NWP to obtain allowances equal to their annual covered carbon emissions. The state’s cap will be reduced over time to meet the state’s carbon emissions reduction targets, which means fewer carbon emissions allowances will be available to purchase each year. These allowances can be purchased through quarterly auctions hosted by the state or bought and sold on a secondary market. In 2023, NWP began purchasing allowances for the carbon emissions from nine of its thirteen compressor stations within the state whose annual carbon emissions have exceeded 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent at least once since 2015. NWP also began purchasing allowances for NWP’s delivery of natural gas to certain of their customers and certain of their facilities in the state whose annual carbon emissions are insufficient to require their direct participation in the program. NWP’s latest rate case settlement allows them to recover the costs of purchasing allowances under the program in their next rate case.\nFor additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, tribal, or local regulatory measures on business and specific environmental issues, please refer to Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” — “Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose them to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed expectations,” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Environmental” and “Environmental Matters” in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 18 – Contingencies and Commitments.\nCompetition\nWilliams’ competitive strategy spans all of its product and service offerings. Williams has a narrowed natural gas value chain focus that supports the exceptional reliability and quality services that are valued by our customers.\nGathering and Processing\nCompetition for natural gas gathering, processing, treating, transportation, and storage, as well as NGLs transportation, fractionation, and storage continues to increase as United States production continues to grow. Williams’ midstream services compete with similar facilities that are in close proximity to its assets.\nWilliams faces competition from companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including major and independent natural gas midstream providers, private equity firms, and major integrated oil and natural gas companies that gather, transport, process, fractionate, store, and market natural gas and NGLs, as well as some larger exploration and production companies that are choosing to develop midstream services to handle their own natural gas.\nWilliams’ gathering and processing agreements are generally long-term agreements that may include acreage dedication. Competition for natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation, flexibility of commercial terms (including but not limited to fees charged, products retained, volume commitments), available capacity, array and quality of services provided, as well as efficiency, reliability, and safety of services. Williams believes its significant \npresence in key supply basins, expertise and reputation as a reliable and safe operator, commitment to sustainability, and ability to offer integrated packages of services positions it well against competition.\nRegulated Interstate Natural Gas Transportation and Storage\nThe market for supplying natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines, storage facilities, and other related services are expanding to service the growing demand for natural gas. Additionally, pipeline capacity in many natural gas supply basins is constrained and facing more regulation and opposition causing competition to increase among pipeline companies as they strive to connect those basins to major natural gas demand centers. \nWilliams predominately competes with major intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. Some local distribution companies are also involved in the long-haul transportation business through joint venture pipelines. The principle elements of competition in the interstate natural gas pipeline business are based on available capacity, rates, reliability, quality of customer service, diversity and flexibility of supply, and proximity or access to customers and market hubs. \nWilliams faces competition in a number of key markets, and competes with other interstate and intrastate pipelines for deliveries to customers who can take deliveries at multiple points. Natural gas delivered on Williams’ system competes with alternative energy sources used to generate electricity such as hydroelectric power, solar, wind, coal, fuel oil, and nuclear. Future demand for natural gas within the power sector could be increased by growing power demand and by regulations limiting or discouraging coal use in power generation. Conversely, natural gas demand could be adversely affected by laws mandating or encouraging solar and wind power sources or restricting the use of natural gas in power generation.\nSignificant entrance barriers to build new pipelines exist, including increased federal and state regulations and elevated public opposition against new pipeline builds, and these factors will continue to impact potential competition for the foreseeable future. However, Williams believes past success in working with regulators and the public, the position of its existing infrastructure, established strategic long-term contracts, and the fact that Williams’ pipelines have numerous receipt and delivery points provide it a competitive advantage, especially along the eastern seaboard and northwestern United States.\nEnergy Management and Marketing Services\nWilliams’ Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment competes with national and regional full-service energy providers, producers, and pipeline marketing affiliates or other marketing companies that aggregate commodities with transportation and storage capacity.\nFor additional information regarding competition for Williams services or otherwise affecting our business, please refer to Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” - “The business, operating results, and financial condition of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s natural gas transportation and midstream businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins and demand for those supplies in the markets that they serve,” “The energy industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses and operating results,” and “Williams, Transco, and NWP may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, as applicable, which could affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s financial condition and ability to grow, as well as the amount of cash available to Williams to pay dividends.”\nHuman Capital Resources\nWilliams is committed to maintaining a work environment that enables Williams to attract, develop, and retain a highly skilled and diverse group of talented employees who help promote long-term value creation now and into the clean energy future.\nEmployees\nAs of February 1, 2025, Williams had 5,829 full-time employees located throughout the United States. During 2024, Williams’ voluntary turnover rate was 5.0 percent.\nTransco and NWP have no employees. Operations, management and certain administrative services are provided by Williams for both Transco and NWP.\nWilliams’ 2023 Sustainability Report is available on its website for more information about human capital programs and initiatives. The 2024 Sustainability Report will be available in the summer of 2025. Nothing on Williams’ website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWorkforce Safety\nWilliams continues to advance a safety-first culture by developing and empowering employees to operate assets in a safe, reliable, and customer-focused way. Williams strives to continuously improve safety and implement best practices to progress towards zero safety incidents. When a safety hazard is recognized, every employee has the authority and responsibility to stop work activities, make changes to enhance safety, and share the lessons learned with the organization on how we made it right. \nWilliams includes three safety and environmental metrics as a part of its Annual Incentive Program design. For 2024, these goals included Critical Tier 3 Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC) Ratio, a High Potential Hazard Identification to Incident Ratio goal aimed to focus attention on behaviors that are the leading causes of incidents, as well as a Methane Emissions Reduction goal focusing on efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by safely and reliably operating and maintaining assets. These three metrics comprise 15 percent of Williams annual incentive program for eligible employees, and reinforce the importance of incident prevention and a commitment to environmental and safety-focused improvements. \nFor 2024, the LOPC Ratio, High Potential Hazard Identification to Incident Ratio and Methane Emissions Reduction goals outperformed the established targets.\nWorkforce Health, Engagement, and Development\nWilliams’ employees are its most valued resource, are instrumental in our mission to safely deliver products that support the clean energy economy, and are the driving force behind Williams’ reputation as a safe, reliable company that does the right thing, every time. Cultivating a healthy work environment increases productivity, enhances employee satisfaction, and promotes long-term value creation.\nWilliams provides a competitive total rewards program that includes base salary, an annual incentive program, retirement benefits, and health benefits, including wellness and employee assistance programs. Williams provides employees with company-paid life insurance, disability coverage, and paid parental leave for both birth and non-birth parents, as well as adoption assistance. The annual incentive program is a key component of Williams’ commitment to a performance culture focused on recognizing and rewarding high performance.\nIn order to attract and retain top talent, Williams creates and is committed to maintaining a safe, inclusive workplace where employees feel valued, heard, respected, and supported in their personal and professional development. Williams leverages social and digital platforms like a careers site, external job boards, virtual and in-person career fairs and community events to attract candidates who have the specific skills we need. Further, leaders participate in inclusion training and utilize interview guides with collaboration and inclusion-focused questions to ensure they are equipped with interviewer best practices that help them holistically evaluate candidates. Williams utilizes employee surveys and employee-led advisory councils to understand the needs of the business from the perspective of employees regarding engagement, development and inclusion. Additionally, Williams supports employee engagement through formal programming including professional development, mentoring, and succession planning. \nWilliams provides extensive corporate and technical training programs that are agile and robust. These programs are designed to support the professional, skill, and technological development of employees, which in turn creates a competitive advantage. Williams is committed to adding long-term value by investing in employees’ growth and development. In addition to internal development programming, Williams also supports external development opportunities to further enhance employees’ professional and technical skills. Performance is measured considering both the achieved results associated with attaining annual goals and the observable skills and behaviors based on defined competencies that contribute to workplace effectiveness and career success. All formal leaders are \nevaluated on two additional competencies around building inclusive, high-performing teams. Including the defined competencies in the annual performance assessments illustrates Williams’ emphasis on, and commitment to, achieving results in the right way.\nAdditionally, Williams is committed to strengthening the communities where we operate through philanthropy and volunteerism. Williams supports Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math education initiatives, community benefit projects, environmental conservation, first responder efforts, and the work of United Way agencies across the United States. \nThe Compensation and Management Development Committee of Williams’ Board of Directors oversees executive compensation and equity-based compensation plans and the material risks associated with the compensation program, as well as the oversight elements of human capital management, including talent development and diversity and inclusion.\nInclusive Workforce\nWilliams is committed to creating an inclusive culture, where differences are embraced and employees feel valued, welcomed, appreciated, and compelled to reach their full potential. Williams believes that inclusion fosters innovation, collaboration, and drives business growth and long-term success. To create a culture of inclusion, Williams embraces, appreciates, and fully leverages the diversity of background and experience within teams. Williams believes that incorporating differences into a team of people who are working toward the same goal provides a competitive advantage. \nTo create space for employees to share personal experiences and perspectives, and to appreciate differences, Williams offers Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These groups are employee-led and based on similar interests and experiences, represent different communities and their allies, and are open to everyone. ERG members participate in community events, volunteer, lend professional and personal support to one another, and promote inclusion across the company. Each ERG leadership team includes one or two vice president sponsors to help the group champion efforts. These leadership teams coordinate and prioritize efforts with corporate oversight and support.\nWilliams is committed to helping all employees develop and succeed. Williams seeks inclusive representation at all levels of the organization through our talent management practices and employee development programs, including required baseline inclusion training for all leaders across the company. \nWilliams’ Diversity and Inclusion Council, which includes members of the executive officer team, organizational and operational leaders, and individual employees, promotes policies, practices, and procedures that support the growth of a high-performing workforce where all individuals can achieve their full potential. The council serves as the governing body over enterprise inclusion initiatives, including events, organized and hosted by one of Williams 10 ERGs, and annual awards that recognize an outstanding leader and an individual contributor who champion inclusion.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Williams’ Board of Directors includes 12 members, 11 of whom are independent members, including the Chairman. As part of the director selection and nominating process, the Governance and Sustainability Committee annually assesses the Board’s effectiveness. Williams strives to maintain a board of directors with varied occupational and personal backgrounds.\nTransactions with Affiliates\nTransco and NWP engage in transactions with Williams and its subsidiaries. Please see Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 – General, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 – Related Party Transactions.\nWebsite Access To Reports and Other Information\nWilliams files its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and other documents electronically with the SEC under the Exchange Act. \nWilliams’ Internet website is www.williams.com.

Each of these factors could adversely affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and, in some cases, reputation. The occurrence of any of such risks could also adversely affect the value of an investment in securities. These factors are summarized below and described in more detail following the summary.\nRisks Related to Business\n•The business, operating results, and financial condition of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s natural gas transportation and midstream businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins and demand for those supplies in the markets that they serve. \n•Prices for natural gas, NGLs, oil, and other commodities are volatile, and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect Williams’ financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain or grow its business.\n•Significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand for Transco and NWP and cause a reduction in or termination of their long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on their systems. \n•Williams, Transco, and NWP are exposed to the credit risk of customers and counterparties, and credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk.\n•Williams, Transco, and NWP face opposition to the operation and expansion of pipelines and facilities from various individuals and groups.\n•Williams, Transco, and NWP may not be able to grow or effectively manage growth.\n•The energy industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses and operating results.\n•Williams does not own 100 percent of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries, including the nonconsolidated entities, which may limit its ability to operate and control these subsidiaries. Certain operations, including the nonconsolidated entities, are conducted through arrangements that may limit Williams’ ability to operate and control these operations.\n•Williams, Transco, and NWP may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, as applicable, which could affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s financial condition and ability to grow, as well as the amount of cash available to Williams to pay dividends.\n•Certain of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s natural gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts.\n•Some of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers.\n•Transco and NWP depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of their revenues. The loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in Transco’s and NWP’s respective businesses.\n•Failure of service providers or disruptions to outsourcing relationships might negatively impact Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to conduct business.\n•An impairment of Williams’ assets, including property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce Williams’ earnings.\n•Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs or risks.\n•Williams, Transco, and NWP may be subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.\n•Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s operations are subject to operational hazards that might result in unforeseen interruptions.\n•Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s assets and operations, as well as their customers’ assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena.\n•Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses could be negatively impacted by acts of terrorism and related disruptions.\n•A breach of information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on Williams, Transco, or NWP, or the third parties with whom they are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and cause reputational harm.\n•If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and NGLs or to treat natural gas, as applicable, Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s revenues could be adversely affected.\n•Williams’ operating results for certain components of its business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\n•Williams, Transco, and NWP do not own all of the land on which their pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt operations.\n•Williams’ business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism.\n•Williams’ costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, and Transco’s and NWP’s allocations regarding the same, are affected by factors beyond Williams’ control.\nRisks Related to Financing\n•A downgrade of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s credit ratings, which are determined outside of their control by independent third parties, could impact liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business, and the ability of Transco and NWP to obtain credit in the future could be affected by Williams’ credit ratings.\n•Difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses and results of operations.\n•Restrictions in Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s debt agreements and the amount of indebtedness may affect future financial and operating flexibility.\n•Changes to interest rates or increases in interest rates could adversely impact Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s access to credit, share price and ability to issue securities or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, as applicable, and Williams’ ability to make cash dividends at intended levels.\n•Williams’ hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of Williams’ results.\n•Access to capital could be affected by financial institutions’ policies concerning fossil-fuel related businesses.\n•Williams can exercise substantial control over Transco’s and NWP’s distribution policies, businesses and operations and may do so in a manner that is adverse to Transco’s and NWP’s interests.\nRisks Related to Regulations\n•The operation of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses or customers.\n•The natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return.\n•Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose them to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed expectations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n•Williams, Transco, and NWP do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of insurers to satisfy claims.\n•Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s results of operations.\n•Holders of Williams’ common stock may not receive dividends in the amount expected or any dividends.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Business\nThe business, operating results, and financial condition of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s natural gas transportation and midstream businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins and demand for those supplies in the markets that they serve.\nThe ability of Williams, Transco, and NWP to maintain and expand their natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production, predominantly by third parties, in the supply basins near Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s pipelines and gathering systems. Production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. Williams, Transco, and NWP do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves, and thus, do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to, or the anticipated life of reserves connected to, Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s systems and processing facilities. In addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, including permitting and environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital have, and may continue to, adversely affect the development and production of existing or additional natural gas reserves, the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities, and the import and export of natural gas suppliers. Localized low natural gas prices in one or more of the existing supply basins connected to Williams, Transco, or NWP, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas available. The competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for customers. A failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to maximize the capacities of their gathering, transportation, and processing facilities, as applicable.\nDemand for Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets served. Demand for natural gas can be affected by weather, future industrial and economic conditions, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy, technological advances in fuel economy, energy generation, and renewable sources of energy, and governmentally imposed constraints, such as prohibitions on natural gas hookups in newly constructed buildings, all of which are matters beyond Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s control.\nA failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for services in the markets served by Williams, Transco, and NWP could result in impairments of Williams’ assets and have a material adverse effect on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPrices for natural gas, NGLs, oil, and other commodities are volatile, and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect Williams’ financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain or grow its business.\nWilliams’ revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and the value of certain components of its business depend primarily upon the prices of natural gas, NGLs, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities, and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of low commodity prices or a decline in commodity prices. Price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount Williams receives for products and services and the volume of products and services sold. Prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and Williams’ ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. Price volatility has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on Williams’ business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe markets for natural gas, NGLs, oil, and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond Williams’ control, including:\n•Imbalances in supply and demand whether rising from worldwide or domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, NGLs, oil, and related commodities;\n•Geopolitical turmoil in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and other producing regions;\n•The activities of OPEC and other countries, whether acting independently of or informally aligned with OPEC, which have significant oil, natural gas, or other commodity production capabilities, including Russia;\n•The level of consumer demand;\n•The price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks;\n•The availability of pipeline capacity;\n•Supply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions;\n•The price and quantity of foreign imports and domestic exports of natural gas and oil;\n•Domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; and\n•The credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold.\nSignificant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand for Transco and NWP and cause a reduction in or termination of their long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on their systems. \nHigher natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the demand for natural gas and, therefore, in Transco’s and NWP’s long-term transportation and storage contracts or throughput on their systems. Also, lower natural gas prices over the long term could result in a decline in the production of natural gas, resulting in reduced contracts or throughput on their systems. As a result, significant prolonged changes in natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on Transco’s and NWP’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. \nWilliams, Transco, and NWP are exposed to the credit risk of customers and counterparties, and credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of business. Generally, Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy, are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns, or are dependent upon Williams, Transco or NWP, in some cases without a readily available alternative, to provide necessary services. However, Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s credit \nprocedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. In a low commodity price environment, certain customers have been or could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress resulting, in some cases, in a customer bankruptcy filing or an effort to renegotiate contracts. To the extent one or more of Williams’, Transco’s, or NWP’s key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, the contracts with such customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or may be renegotiated. Further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection, or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. If Williams, Transco, and NWP fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause Williams, Transco, or NWP to write down or write off accounts receivable. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect Williams’, Transco’s, or NWP’s operating results for the period in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on Williams’, Transco’s, or NWP’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP face opposition to the operation and expansion of pipelines and facilities from various individuals and groups.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP have experienced, and anticipate continuing to face, opposition to the operation and expansion of pipelines and facilities from governmental officials, environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups, and other advocates. In some instances, Williams, Transco, and NWP encounter opposition that disfavors hydrocarbon-based energy supplies regardless of practical implementation or financial considerations. Opposition to operation and expansion can take many forms, including the delay or denial of required governmental permits, organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt, or delay the operation or expansion of assets and business. In addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property, or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of operations. Any such event that delays or prevents the expansion of Williams’, Transco’s, or NWP’s businesses, that interrupts the revenues generated by operations, or that causes significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s financial condition and results of operations.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP may not be able to grow or effectively manage growth.\nAs part of Williams’ growth strategy, Williams considers acquisition opportunities. Suitable acquisition candidates or assets may not be available on terms and conditions Williams finds acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate or assets, Williams may not be chosen as the acquirer. If Williams is able to acquire a targeted business, Williams may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner.\nAdditionally, as part of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s growth strategy, Williams, Transco, and NWP engage in significant capital projects and have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. These are the processes used to identify, evaluate, and execute on capital projects, and the investment evaluation process is used by Williams’ to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisitions. Williams, Transco, and NWP may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or the investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. Growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing, or treating pipelines and facilities, NGL transportation, or fractionation or storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities. Additional risks associated with construction may include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, permits, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed, on time or at all, and the risk that construction cost overruns, including due to inflation or the imposition of tariffs on foreign-made materials and \ngoods (including steel and steel pipes) necessary to conduct business, could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. Additional risks associated with growing the business include, among others, that:\n•Changing circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact the investment analysis, including projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes that are materially different than anticipated;\n•Williams, Transco, or NWP could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets, and Williams, Transco, or NWP may assume liabilities that were not disclosed, exceed estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate;\n•Acquisitions could disrupt ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations, and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls, and procedures;\n•Acquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including the issuance of debt or equity, and Williams, Transco, or NWP may not be able to access credit or capital markets or obtain acceptable terms.\nIf realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of assets, or cash flows.\nThe energy industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses and operating results.\nWilliams has numerous competitors in all aspects of its businesses, and additional competitors may enter its markets. Any current or future competitor that delivers natural gas, NGLs, or other commodities into the areas that Williams operates could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those Williams provides because of price, location, facilities, or other factors. In addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources, which could affect Williams’ ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion, or refurbishment of their facilities. Further, natural gas also competes with other forms of energy available to customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils, and other alternative energy sources. Failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on Williams’ business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. \nSimilarly, Transco and NWP compete primarily with other interstate pipelines and storage facilities in the transportation and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition among interstate natural gas transportation and storage assets are rates, terms of service, access to natural gas supplies, flexibility, and reliability. Although most of Transco’s and NWP’s current capacity is fully contracted, the FERC has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces in the interstate natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased competition throughout the industry. Similarly, a highly liquid competitive commodity market in natural gas, and increasingly competitive markets for natural gas services, including competitive secondary markets in pipeline capacity, have developed. As a result, pipeline capacity is being used more efficiently, and peaking and storage services are increasingly effective substitutes for annual pipeline capacity. As a result, Transco and NWP could experience some “turnback” of firm capacity as the primary terms of existing agreements expire. If Transco and NWP are unable to remarket this capacity or can remarket it only at substantially discounted rates compared to previous contracts, they or their remaining customers, may have to bear the costs associated with the turned back capacity. Moreover, Williams and its other affiliates may not be limited in their ability to compete with Transco and NWP. \nAdditionally, some of Transco’s and NWP’s competitors may have greater financial resources and access to greater supplies of natural gas than they do. Some of these competitors may expand or construct transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for natural gas supplies or the services provided to customers. In a number of key markets, interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems, enabling local distribution companies and end users to choose a transmission provider based on considerations other than location. Other entities could construct new pipelines or expand existing pipelines that could potentially serve the same markets as Transco’s and NWP’s pipeline systems. Any such new pipelines could \noffer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers because of locations, facilities, or other factors. These new pipelines could charge rates or provide service to locations that would result in greater net profit for shippers and producers, and thereby force Transco and NWP to lower the rates charged for service on their pipelines to extend existing transportation service agreements or to attract new customers. Transco and NWP are aware of proposals by competitors to expand pipeline capacity in certain markets Transco and NWP also serve, which, if the proposed projects proceed, could increase the competitive pressure upon Transco and NWP. Transco and NWP may not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on Transco’s and NWP’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWilliams does not own 100 percent of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries, including the nonconsolidated entities, which may limit its ability to operate and control these subsidiaries. Certain operations, including the nonconsolidated entities, are conducted through arrangements that may limit Williams’ ability to operate and control these operations.\nThe operations of Williams’ current non-wholly owned subsidiaries are conducted in accordance with their organizational documents. Williams anticipates that it will enter into more such arrangements, including through new joint venture structures. Williams may have limited operational flexibility in such current and future arrangements and may not be able to control the timing or amount of cash distributions received. In certain cases:\n•Williams cannot control the amount of cash reserves determined to be necessary to operate the business, which reduces cash available for distributions;\n•Williams cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that it is required to fund, and Williams is dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures;\n•Williams may be subject to restrictions or limitations on its ability to sell or transfer its interests in the jointly owned assets;\n•Williams may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in the area of mutual interest;\n•Williams has limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations; and\n•Williams may have additional obligations, such as required capital contributions that are important to the success of the operations.\nIn addition, conflicts of interest may arise between Williams, on the one hand, and other interest owners, on the other hand. If such conflicts of interest arise, Williams may not have the ability to control the outcome with respect to the matter in question. Disputes between Williams and other interest owners may also result in delays, litigation, or operational impasses.\nThe risks described above or the failure to continue such arrangements could adversely affect Williams’ ability to conduct the operations that are the subject of such arrangements which could, in turn, negatively affect Williams’ business, growth strategy, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, as applicable, which could affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s financial condition and ability to grow, as well as the amount of cash available to Williams to pay dividends.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of revenues and supply of natural gas and NGLs, as applicable. Although many of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if Williams, Transco, and NWP are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to it by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as Williams’ growth plans and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be materially adversely affected.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond their control, including:\n•The level of existing and new competition in Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses or from alternative sources, such as electricity, renewable resources, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy;\n•General economic, financial markets, and industry conditions;\n•The effects of regulation on Williams, Transco, and NWP, their customers, and their contracting practices;\n•Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to understand their customers’ expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services, and effectively manage customer relationships. The results of these efforts will impact Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s reputation and positioning in the market.\nIn addition, Williams’ markets are affected by natural gas and NGL prices, demand, availability, and margins. Higher prices for energy commodities related to Williams’ businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on the pipeline systems. Lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact the ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on the pipeline systems.\nCertain of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s natural gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s natural gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. It is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues collected. Although other services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a “negotiated rate” that may be above or below the FERC regulated cost-based rate for that service. These “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.\nFurther, the costs of testing, maintaining, or repairing regulated facilities for Williams, Transco, and NWP may exceed Williams’, Transco’s and NWP’s expectations, and the FERC may not allow, or competition in the markets may prevent, recovery of such costs in the rates charged for applicable services at Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s regulated pipelines and facilities. Williams, Transco and NWP have experienced and could experience in the future unexpected leaks or ruptures on their regulated natural gas pipeline systems or storage facilities. Either as a preventative measure or in response to a leak or another issue, Williams, Transco and NWP could be required by regulatory authorities to test or undertake modifications to their regulated systems. If the cost of testing, maintaining, or repairing regulated facilities exceeds expectations, and the FERC does not allow recovery, or competition in the markets prevents recovering such costs in the rates charged for Williams’, Transco’s and NWP’s regulated services, such costs could have a material adverse impact on Williams’, Transco’s and NWP’s businesses, financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nSome of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers.\nSome of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for the delivery of critical goods or services. If a supplier on which one of the businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services, such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. If Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses are unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks, and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nTransco and NWP depend on certain key customers for a significant portion of their revenues. The loss of any of these key customers or the loss of any contracted volumes could result in a decline in Transco’s and NWP’s respective businesses.\nTransco and NWP rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of their revenues. Although some of these customers are subject to long-term contracts, Transco and NWP may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of these contracts on favorable terms, or at all. For the year ended December 31, 2024, Transco’s largest customer was Dominion Energy, Inc., which accounted for approximately 7 percent of its operating revenue, and NWP’s largest customer was Puget Sound Energy, Inc., which accounted for approximately 31 percent of its operating revenue. The loss of all, or even a portion of, the revenues from contracted volumes supplied by Transco’s and NWP’s key customers, as a result of competition, creditworthiness, inability to negotiate extensions or replacements of contracts, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on their businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For more information regarding Transco’s and NWP’s customer revenues, please read Note 16 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk.\nFailure of service providers or disruptions to outsourcing relationships might negatively impact Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to conduct their businesses.\nTransco and NWP rely on Williams and other third parties for certain services necessary for Transco and NWP to be able to conduct business. Certain of Williams’ accounting and information technology services, which are relied upon by Transco and NWP, are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the United States. Services provided pursuant to these arrangements could be disrupted. Similarly, the expiration of agreements associated with such arrangements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. Williams’ reliance on others as service providers, and Transco’s and NWP’s reliance on Williams’ reliance on others as service providers, could have a material adverse effect on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAn impairment of Williams’ assets, including property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce Williams’ earnings.\nGAAP requires Williams to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. The outcome of such testing could result in impairments of Williams’ assets including property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/ or equity-method investments. Additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. If Williams determines that an impairment has occurred, Williams would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs or risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices. Investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus and activism related to ESG (as proponents or opponents) and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or that are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage, and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP face pressures from their stakeholders, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce carbon footprint, and promote sustainability. Williams’ stockholders may require Williams to implement ESG procedures or standards to continue engaging with Williams, to remain invested in Williams, or before they may make further investments in Williams. Additionally, Williams, Transco, and NWP may face reputational challenges in the event their ESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies. Williams, Transco, and NWP adopted certain practices as highlighted in Williams’ 2023 Sustainability Report, including with respect to air emissions, biodiversity and land use, climate \nchange, and environmental stewardship. It is possible, however, that Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s stakeholders might not be satisfied with these sustainability efforts or the speed of their adoption. If Williams, Transco and NWP do not meet stakeholders’ expectations, Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses, ability to access capital, and/or Williams’ stock price could be harmed.\nAdditionally, adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry related to the worldwide social and political environments, including uncertainty or instability resulting from climate change, changes in political leadership and environmental policies, changes in geopolitical-social views toward fossil fuels and renewable energy, concern about the environmental impact of climate change, and investors’ expectations regarding ESG matters, may also adversely affect demand for Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s services. Any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could have a significant financial and operational adverse impact on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the price of Williams’ stock and Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses and financial condition.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP may be subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.\nThe threat of global climate change may create physical and financial risks to Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses. Energy needs vary with weather conditions. To the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require Williams, Transco, and NWP to invest in more pipelines and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s financial condition through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s operating territory could also have an impact on their revenues. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase the cost of providing service. Williams, Transco, and NWP may not be able to pass on the higher costs to customers or recover all costs related to mitigating these physical risks.\nAdditionally, many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events, which may lead to higher insurance costs, or a decrease in available coverage, for Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s assets in areas subject to severe weather. These climate-related changes could damage physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone and rain-susceptible regions.\nTo the extent financial markets view climate change and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s cost of and access to capital. Climate change and GHG regulation could also reduce demand for Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s services. The business could also be affected by the potential for lawsuits against GHG emitters, based on links drawn between GHG emissions and climate change.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s operations are subject to operational risks and hazards that might result in accidents and unforeseen interruptions.\nThere are operational risks and hazards associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation, and storage of NGLs, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including:\n•Aging infrastructure and mechanical problems;\n•Damages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions;\n•Uncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), NGLs, crude oil, or other products;\n•Collapse or failure of storage facilities or caverns, as applicable;\n•Operator error;\n•Damage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment;\n•Pollution and other environmental risks;\n•Fires, explosions, craterings, and blowouts;\n•Security risks, including cybersecurity;\n•Operating in a marine environment, as applicable.\nAny of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of operations, loss of services to customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to Williams, Transco, and NWP. The location of certain segments of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damage resulting from these risks. An event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s assets and operations, as well as their customers’ assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and their customers’ assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for Williams, Transco, and NWP to realize the historic rates of return associated with their assets and operations. A significant disruption in Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s or their customers’ operations or the occurrence of a significant liability for which Williams, Transco, and NWP are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on their businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses could be negatively impacted by acts of terrorism and related disruptions.\nGiven the volatile nature of the commodities Williams, Transco, and NWP transport, process, store, and sell, their assets and the assets of their customers and others in the industry may be targets of terrorist activities. Uncertainty surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, or other sustained military campaigns, may affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s operations in unpredictable ways, including the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terrorism. A terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt business, limit access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to operations, such as full or partial disruption to Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to produce, process, transport, or distribute natural gas, NGLs, or other commodities, as applicable. Acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA breach of information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on Williams, Transco, or NWP, or the third parties with whom they are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and cause reputational harm.\nWilliams relies on its information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information used to safely operate Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s assets. Transco and NWP rely on Williams for their information technology infrastructure. The Williams Board of Directors has oversight responsibility with regard to cybersecurity risks, and reviews management’s efforts to address and mitigate cybersecurity risks, including the establishment and implementation of policies to address cybersecurity threats. Williams has invested, and expects to continue to invest, significant time, manpower, and capital in its information technology infrastructure. However, the age, operating systems, or condition of the current information technology infrastructure and software assets and the ability to maintain and upgrade such assets could affect Williams’, and thus Transco’s and NWP’s, ability to resist cybersecurity threats. While Williams believes that it maintains appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, Williams regularly faces cybersecurity and other security threats to its information technology infrastructure, including risks that may be enhanced through the use of artificial intelligence, which could include threats to operational industrial control systems and safety systems that \noperate its pipelines, plants, and assets. Williams faces unlawful attempts to gain access to its information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, “hacktivists”, or private individuals. Williams faces the threat of theft and misuse of sensitive data and information, including customer and employee information. Williams also faces attempts to gain access to information related to its assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. Williams is also subject to cybersecurity risks arising from the fact that Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s business operations are interconnected with third parties, including third-party pipelines, other facilities and contractors and vendors. In addition, the breach of certain business systems could affect Williams’ ability to correctly record, process, and report financial information. Breaches in Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, which may increase as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine or other geopolitical tensions and conflicts, could result in damage to or destruction of assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, the loss of contracts, the imposition of significant costs associated with remediation and litigation, heightened regulatory scrutiny, increased insurance costs, and have a material adverse effect on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and NGLs or to treat natural gas, as applicable, Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s revenues could be adversely affected.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from their pipelines and storage facilities for the benefit of their customers. Because Williams, Transco, and NWP do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within Williams’, Transco’s or NWP’s control. If these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, Williams, Transco, and NWP and their customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store, or deliver natural gas or NGL products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed NGLs, as applicable, thereby reducing revenues. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnection or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on Williams’, Transco’s, or NWP’s pipelines or gathering systems, as applicable, or processed, fractionated, treated, or stored at Williams’, Transco’s, or NWP’s facilities, as applicable, could have a material adverse effect on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWilliams’ operating results for certain components of its business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\nRevenues from certain components of Williams’ business can have seasonal characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. As a result, Williams’ overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from Williams’ expectations depending on the nature and location of its facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of the natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP do not own all of the land on which their pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt operations.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP do not own all of the land on which their pipelines and facilities have been constructed. As such, Williams, Transco, and NWP are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. In those instances in which Williams, Transco and NWP do not own the land on which their facilities are located, Williams, Transco, and NWP obtain the rights to construct and operate their facilities and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. In addition, some of Williams’ and NWP’s facilities cross Native American lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited terms. Williams and NWP may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by Native American tribes. Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s loss of any of these rights, through their inability to renew right-of-way contracts \nor otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on their businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWilliams’ business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism.\nIn recent years, stockholder activism, including threatened or actual proxy contests, has been directed against numerous public companies, including Williams. Williams was the target of a proxy contest from a stockholder activist, which resulted in Williams incurring significant costs. If stockholder activists were to again take or threaten to take actions against Williams or seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, or operations of Williams, Williams could incur significant costs as well as the distraction of management, which could have an adverse effect on Williams’ business or financial results. In addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in Williams’ stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of Williams’ business.\nWilliams’ costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, and Transco’s and NWP’s allocations regarding the same, are affected by factors beyond Williams’ control.\nWilliams has defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The timing and amount of the funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that Williams’ controls, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of Williams’ control, such as asset returns, interest rates, and changes in pension laws. Changes to these and other factors can significantly increase Williams’ funding requirements and could have a significant adverse effect on Williams’ financial condition and results of operations.\nTransco and NWP have no employees; employees of Williams and its affiliates provide services to Transco and NWP. As a result, Transco and NWP are allocated a portion of Williams’ cost for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The timing and amount of these allocations depends on factors that Williams controls, and any changes can significantly increase the allocations, which could have a significant adverse effect on Transco’s and NWP’s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financing\nA downgrade of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s credit ratings, which are determined outside of their control by independent third parties, could impact their liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business, and the ability of Transco and NWP to obtain credit in the future could be affected by Williams’ credit ratings.\nDowngrades of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s credit ratings increase cost of borrowing and could require Williams, Transco, and NWP to provide collateral to their counterparties, negatively impacting available liquidity. In addition, Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to access capital markets could be limited by the downgrading of their credit ratings.\nCredit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. The analysis includes a number of criteria such as business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests.\nCredit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. As of the date of the filing of this report, Williams, Transco, and NWP have been assigned an investment-grade credit rating by the credit ratings agencies.\nIn addition, substantially all of Williams’ operations are conducted through its subsidiaries. Williams’ cash flows are substantially derived from loans, dividends, and distributions paid to it by its subsidiaries. Due to the relationship of Transco and NWP as subsidiaries of Williams, Transco’s and NWP’s ability to obtain credit will be affected by Williams’ credit ratings. Any downgrading of a Williams credit rating could result in a downgrading of a Transco and NWP credit rating, which could adversely affect Transco’s and NWP’s access to capital and limit their ability to obtain financing in the future upon favorable terms, if at all.\nDifficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses and results of operations.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in the global financial markets. Included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to them by customers. Geopolitical tensions and conflicts, including those in the Middle East, as well as the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and the actions undertaken by western nations in response to these conflicts, have had, and may continue to have, adverse impacts on global financial markets. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, Williams, Transco, and NWP may be unable to implement their business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. In addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over U.S. fiscal and monetary policies. These concerns, as well as actions taken by the U.S. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and U.S. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact Williams, Transco, and NWP in the manner described above.\nWilliams, Transco and NWP are party to a credit agreement with aggregate commitments available of $3.75 billion, with up to an additional $500 million increase in aggregate commitments available under certain circumstances. Transco and NWP are each subject to a $500 million borrowing sublimit. The ability of Williams, Transco, and NWP to borrow under that facility could be impaired if one or more of the lenders fails to honor its contractual obligation to lend. For more information regarding financing, please read Note 13 – Debt and Banking Arrangements.\nRestrictions in Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s debt agreements and the amount of their indebtedness may affect their future financial and operating flexibility.\nWilliams’ total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion and commercial paper) as of December 31, 2024, was $26.9 billion, including the long-term debt of Transco and NWP. The total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of December 31, 2024, for Transco and NWP was $5.2 billion and $582 million, respectively.\nThe agreements governing Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s indebtedness contain covenants that restrict Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s, as applicable, and their respective subsidiaries’, ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness, and ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its respective assets in certain circumstances. In addition, certain of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, the ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, and to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. Additionally, Transco has a debt covenant in one series of its notes restricting its ability and that of its subsidiaries to guarantee certain indebtedness. Certain of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s debt agreements also contain, and those Williams, Transco, and NWP enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants, and other limitations with which they will need to comply.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. For example, they could:\n•Make it more difficult for Williams, Transco, and NWP to satisfy their obligations with respect to their indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness;\n•Impair Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or limited liability company purposes, as applicable, or other purposes;\n•Diminish Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in their business or the economy generally;\n•Require Williams, Transco, and NWP to dedicate a substantial portion of their cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, \nacquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes or limited liability company purposes, as applicable, or other purposes;\n•Limit Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in their business and the industry in which they operate, including limiting their ability to expand or pursue business activities and preventing Williams, Transco, and NWP from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to Williams, Transco, and NWP.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to comply with their debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance their existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on their operating performance. Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. If Williams, Transco, and NWP are unable to comply with these covenants, meet their debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, Williams, Transco, and NWP could be forced to restructure or refinance their indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. Williams, Transco, and NWP may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing their indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. Williams, Transco, and NWP may not have sufficient liquidity to repay their indebtedness in such circumstances. In addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in each of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on their liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. For more information regarding debt agreements, please read Note 13 – Debt and Banking Arrangements.\nChanges to interest rates or increases in interest rates could adversely impact Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s access to credit, share price, and ability to issue securities or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, as applicable, and Williams’ ability to make cash dividends at intended levels.\nInterest rates have fluctuated in recent years but could increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s financing costs to increase accordingly. As with other yield-oriented securities, Williams’ share price will be impacted by the level of Williams’ dividends and implied dividend yield. The dividend yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in Williams’ shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on Williams’ share price and Williams’ ability to issue equity or pay cash dividends at intended levels or Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to incur debt.\nWilliams’ hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of Williams’ results.\nIn an effort to manage Williams’ financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, Williams has entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with its assets and operations. In these hedging activities, Williams has used, and may in the future use, fixed-price, forward, physical purchase, and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. Nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract’s counterparty credit or performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. While Williams attempts to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by its credit policy, Williams may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default. The difference in accounting treatment for the underlying position and the financial instrument used to hedge the value of the contract can cause volatility in Williams’ reported net income while the positions are open due to mark-to-market accounting.\nAccess to capital could be affected by financial institutions’ policies concerning fossil fuel related businesses.\nPublic concern regarding the potential effects of climate change has directed increased attention towards the funding sources of fossil-fuel energy companies. As a result, certain financial institutions, funds, and other sources \nof capital have restricted or eliminated their investment in certain market segments of fossil-fuel related energy. Ultimately, limiting fossil-fuel related companies’ access to capital could make it more difficult for Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s customers to secure funding for exploration and production activities or for Williams, Transco, and NWP to secure funding for growth projects. Such a lack of capital could also both indirectly affect demand for Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s services and directly affect their ability to fund construction or other capital projects.\nWilliams can exercise substantial control over Transco’s and NWP’s distribution policies, businesses, and operations and may do so in a manner that is adverse to Transco’s and NWP’s interests.\nBecause Transco and NWP are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Williams, Williams exercises substantial control over their businesses and operations and makes determinations with respect to, among other things, the following:\n•Payment of distributions and repayment of advances;\n•Decisions on financings and capital raising activities;\n•Mergers or other business combinations; \n•Acquisition or disposition of assets.\nWilliams could decide to increase distributions or advances to Transco’s and NWP’s member consistent with existing debt covenants. This could adversely affect Transco’s or NWP’s liquidity.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nThe operation of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses or customers.\nPublic and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. Such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. Both the shippers on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates charged under certain circumstances. Any successful challenge could materially affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s results of operations.\nCertain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. Adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, Williams, Transco, and NWP cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against them, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses and results of operations or increase their operating costs in other ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against Williams, Transco, and NWP which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage their reputation. The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance.\nIn addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner that differs from prior regulatory action. New laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might also be adopted or become applicable to Williams, Transco, and NWP, their customers, or their business activities. If new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that Williams, Transco, and NWP transport, gather, process, and treat could decline, compliance costs could increase, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return.\nIn addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, interstate pipeline transportation and storage services and related assets are subject to regulation by the FERC. Federal regulation extends to such matters as:\n•Transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce;\n•Rates, operating terms, types of services, and conditions of service;\n•Certification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities;\n•Acquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities;\n•Accounts and records;\n•Depreciation and amortization policies;\n•Relationships with affiliated companies that are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business;\n•Market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases, or transportation of natural gas.\nRegulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s businesses in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues or setting future tariff rates to levels such that revenues are inadequate to recover increases in operating costs or to sustain an adequate return on capital investments, decreasing volumes in the pipelines, increasing costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of the pipeline business.\nFurthermore, Transco charges its transportation customers a separate fee to access its offshore facilities in the Gulf of America, unlike other interstate pipelines that own facilities offshore. The separate charge is referred to as an “IT feeder” charge. The “IT feeder” rate is charged only when gas is actually transported on the applicable facilities and typically it is paid by producers or marketers. Because the “IT feeder” rate is typically paid by producers and marketers, it generally results in netback prices to producers that are slightly lower than the netbacks realized by producers transporting on other interstate pipelines. This rate design disparity can result in producers bypassing Transco’s offshore facilities in favor of alternative transportation facilities. \nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose them to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed expectations.\nWilliams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. Substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation, and storage of NGLs, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities, as applicable. New or amended environmental laws and regulations can also result in significant increases in capital costs incurred to comply with such laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all operations, and delays or denials in granting permits.\nJoint and several strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under, or from Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s properties and facilities. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where their wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with \nenvironmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from their operations. Some sites at which Williams, Transco, and NWP operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites.\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of their facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, Williams, Transco, and NWP could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose them to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps Williams, Transco and NWP could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and Williams, Transco, and NWP might be required to shut down, divest, or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause them to incur losses.\nIn addition, climate change regulations and the costs that may be associated with such regulations and with the regulation of emissions of GHGs have the potential to affect the businesses of Williams, Transco, and NWP. Regulatory actions by the Environmental Protection Agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to operate and maintain facilities, install new emission controls on facilities, or administer and manage any GHG emissions program. Williams, Transco, and NWP believe it is possible that future governmental legislation and/or regulation may require them either to limit GHG emissions associated with operations or to purchase allowances for such emissions. Williams, Transco, and NWP could also be subjected to a carbon tax assessed on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions or otherwise. However, Williams, Transco, and NWP cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations might take, the stringency of any such regulations or when they might become effective. Several legislative bills have been introduced in the United States Congress that would require carbon dioxide emission reductions. Previously considered proposals have included, among other things, limitations on the amount of GHGs that can be emitted (so called “caps”) together with systems of permitted emissions allowances. These proposals could require Williams, Transco, and NWP to reduce emissions or to purchase allowances for such emissions.\nIn addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of GHG emissions sooner than and/or independent of federal regulation. These regulations could be more stringent than any federal legislation that may be adopted. Future legislation and/or regulation designed to reduce GHG emissions could make some of Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s activities uneconomic to maintain or operate. Williams, Transco, and NWP continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments in this area and otherwise take efforts to limit and reduce GHG emissions from their facilities. Although the regulation of GHG emissions may have a material impact on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s operations and rates, Williams, Transco, and NWP believe it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential costs of the impacts.\nIf Williams, Transco, and NWP are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements, it could have a material adverse effect on Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s results of operations and financial condition. \nGeneral Risk Factors\nWilliams, Transco, and NWP do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of their insurers to satisfy their claims.\nIn accordance with customary industry practice, Williams, Transco, and NWP maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels they believe to be appropriate. The occurrence of any risks not fully covered by Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s insurance could have a material adverse effect on their businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and their ability to repay debt.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s results of operations.\nEvents such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, the challenges of attracting new, qualified workers to the midstream energy industry, or unavailability of contract labor may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated \nwith skill development, including with the workforce needs associated with projects and ongoing operations. Transco and NWP have no employees; employees of Williams and its affiliates provide services. Williams’ failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Williams’, Transco’s, and NWP’s ability to manage and operate the businesses. If Williams is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, including members of senior management, results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nHolders of Williams’ common stock may not receive dividends in the amount expected or any dividends.\nWilliams may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. The actual amount of cash Williams pays as a dividend may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond Williams’ control, including:\n•The amount of cash that Williams’ subsidiaries distribute to it;\n•The amount of cash Williams generates from its operations, Williams’ working capital needs, Williams’ level of capital expenditures, and Williams’ ability to borrow;\n•The restrictions contained in Williams’ indentures and credit facility and Williams’ debt service requirements;\n•The cost of acquisitions, if any.\nA failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage, and a decrease in the value of Williams’ stock price.",
