Internal capabilities and acquisitions expand the Company’s ability to unlock the potential of nature and serve customers’ evolving and expanding needs through its offerings of innovative ingredients for all segments. \nSource and Availability of Raw Materials\nA significant majority of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities. In addition, the Company sources specific fruits, vegetables, and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors. In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. The Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis. The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nSome of the principal crops that ADM sources and processes present specific climate change risks. For example, South American soy and global palm present risks of deforestation due to their proximity to the forest and other high-carbon-value landscapes. In addition, when not managed appropriately, row crops such as corn, soy, wheat, and canola present environmental risks such as water quality impairment, erosion, soil degradation, and GHG emissions. However, these crops also present an opportunity to combat climate change through their ability to sequester carbon in the soil using regenerative agricultural practices. In 2022, ADM launched its “re: generations” program to engage and encourage growers in its supply chain to implement regenerative agriculture practices. In the first year of the program, the Company exceeded its goal to enroll one million acres. The Company has since expanded its regenerative agriculture program to cover more than 2.8 million acres across 18 U.S. states and Canada and has also extended the program into new geographies, launching regenerative agriculture projects in Europe and South America, with a goal to enroll five million acres globally by the end of 2025.\nUnder the stewardship of ADM’s Board of Directors, the Company has established several key social and environmental policies that collectively outline expectations for its employees, business partners and contractors, and the Company as a whole with respect to its sourcing operations. These policies set the standards that govern the Company’s approach to environmental stewardship, employee conduct, and raw material sourcing, among other areas, and outline ADM’s positions on issues of widespread public interest. These standards are included in, among others, the Company’s Code of Conduct; Environment, Health, and Safety Policy; Human Rights Policy; Commitment to Protect Forests, Biodiversity, and Communities; Statement on Genetically Modified Organisms; Statement on Animal Testing; Commitment to Anti-Corruption Compliance; Protocol for Managing Supplier Non-Compliance and ADM Supplier Expectations, all of which are available on the Company’s website (see Item 1, Business - Available Information).\nIn addition to policies, a portion of the Company’s commodity sourcing is conducted using third-party certification programs including ADM Responsible Soy, Biomass Biofuel Sustainability Voluntary Scheme, Round Table for Responsible Soy, International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil, and U.S. Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol. These programs have standards that are established to provide transparency on specific sustainability-related criteria. ADM procures canola, soybeans, and palm under these programs.\nTrademarks, Brands, Recipes, and other Intellectual Property\nThe Company owns trademarks, brands, recipes, and other intellectual property including patents, with a net book value of $660 million as of December 31, 2024. More than 90% of these intangibles are in the Nutrition segment which is not materially dependent upon any individual trademark, brand, recipe or other intellectual property.\nSeasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers\nThere is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains. The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world. Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.\n\nThe prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company’s working capital requirements. Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months. Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.\nNo material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nCompetition\nThe Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company. Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset portfolio. The Company’s Nutrition business is a vertically integrated business that provides ingredients and solutions for humans, animals, and pets in a highly competitive environment with a variety of companies offering the same products and services. The industry includes ingredient suppliers, contract manufacturers, global fast moving consumer goods companies, and private label brands, as well as smaller companies that specialize in specific niche markets. The Company focuses on staying ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and science-based solutions, building direct-to-consumer sales channels and focusing on consumer needs, expanding into new markets, building strategic partnerships, leveraging data and technology, and building a strong distribution network. \nResearch, Creation, Design, and Development (R&D)\nR&D expense, net of reimbursements of government grants, for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $269 million.\nThe Company is committed to global health and sustainable products, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. ADM’s R&D efforts focus on creating science-based products, solutions, and technologies aligned with macro trends in food security, sustainable processes, health, and personalized nutrition. The Company strategically invests in R&D across the entire nutrition value chain by leveraging its access to innovative processes and product optimization. The R&D team is also engaged in BioSolutions initiatives which are a key part of ADM’s commitment to utilize its value chain to reduce its carbon footprint, redesign core products with sustainable alternatives, and explore new markets.\nThe Company is dedicated to transforming aspirations into solutions and brand innovation. The integration of interdisciplinary experts in biology, chemistry, physiology, nutrition, agronomy, and product development provides a competitive edge.\nR&D teams are closely connected to customers and the global markets. Targeted product development leverages innovative ingredients and ADM’s existing portfolio across different segments. R&D innovation centers across three continents enable the rapid transformation of ideas into products. An external network of collaborators, including customers, key opinion leaders, start-ups, and academia amplifies the Company’s scientific excellence.\nThe scope and application of the Company’s technical capabilities reinforce its commitment to global health and sustainable products. High-throughput screening and characterization facilities strengthen ADM’s extensive ingredient database. Formulation platforms enable rapid upscaling or downscaling for cost-effective innovation. Resources dedicated to functional ingredient characterization enhance the Company’s capacity to deliver on the science behind each product.\nADM’s R&D strategy prioritizes fulfilling customer expectations and supporting the Company’s growth. The Company’s future strategy aims to deliver world-class solutions more efficiently and sustainably, and to capitalize on ADM’s full potential. \nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\nThe Company knows that the health of our natural resources is critical to our future, and that its commitment to sustainable practices will result in a stronger ADM and a better world. ADM is committed to being a force for change in developing innovative, sustainable solutions in agriculture, food and nutrition, industrial and consumer products, energy, and packaging materials while pursuing ways to continually improve the Company’s efforts in both protecting the environment and enhancing environmental sustainability. The United Nations Development Programme created the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) blueprint as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. ADM focuses its efforts toward goals that align with its business objectives and allow the Company to make the greatest contribution towards the achievement of the SDGs, specifically Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Decent Work and Economic Growth, Climate Action, and Life On Land.\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nGovernance \nThe Sustainability and Technology Committee of the Board actively oversees the Company’s objectives, goals, strategies, and activities relating to sustainability. The Sustainability Committee also oversees the Company’s compliance with sustainability laws and regulations, assesses performance relating to industry benchmarks, and assists the Board of Directors in overseeing the Company’s operations as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen in order to enhance shareholder value and protect ADM’s reputation. The Company’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Senior Vice President of Global Operations, and Chief Technology Officer regularly attend committee meetings as management representatives. The Executive Council of ADM, the Company’s highest strategic and operational body, provides close supervision of the Company’s ESG efforts and in-depth review of sustainability issues. Furthermore, regional sustainability teams, along with the corporate sustainability team, support the Chief Sustainability Officer to drive sustainability efforts in the Company’s facilities and supply chains around the world. ADM’s sustainability efforts are also supported by functional expertise throughout the Company such as in Operations and Utilities, Supply Chain and Procurement, Agricultural Services and Oilseeds, and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS).\nStrategy \nThe Company aims to mitigate climate change and protect biodiversity through renewable product and process innovations, supply chain efforts including a commitment to no-deforestation or native vegetation conversion and regenerative agriculture, and a strategic approach to operational excellence with a focus on enhancing the efficiency of ADM’s production plants throughout its global operations.\nADM believes sustainability is critical to its future growth strategy. ADM’s strategic plan of sustainable growth leverages the trends and technologies in sustainability to help the Company grow and create value for its stakeholders. Agricultural Services and Oilseeds is focused on traceability of sourcing and differentiation and working with growers on low carbon agricultural practices and products. Carbohydrate Solutions is focused on decarbonization efforts that increasingly position the segment to offer low-carbon intensity feedstocks for biosolutions and biomaterials, including fuel solutions, to replace petroleum-based products. Nutrition is working with suppliers and customers to identify nature positive solutions that can reduce environmental impact in supply chains. The growth of these projects and businesses will be integral to supporting the objective of helping the planet limit total global warming to the 1.5°C threshold indicated by the United Nations. Additionally, the Company has incorporated the achievement of GHG emission goals and water reuse goals to executive performance measurement to reflect the strategic importance of ESG to its business. \nMoreover, ADM has a large industrial footprint and believes it is important to reduce GHG emissions related to its business activities and the entire agricultural supply chain. The Company continues to use internal and external resources to identify opportunities and take action to reduce its GHG emissions globally to meet its continued commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nADM's Strive 35 plan is an ambitious plan to, by 2035, reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% from a 2019 baseline, reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% from a 2021 baseline, increase use of low-carbon energy sources to 25% of total energy used, reduce absolute water withdrawal by 10%, and achieve a 90% landfill diversion rate. To support the Company’s Strive 35 environmental goals, ADM developed a feasibility study with a leading engineering professional services firm that provides the technology pathway for absolute reduction of GHG emissions by 2035. The Company has also committed to develop a global strategy focused on improving community well-being in priority watersheds, including water-stressed areas, by the end of 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company reduced absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 14.7% and reduced Scope 3 GHG emissions by 7.7%. The Company reduced absolute water withdrawal by 4.2%. The Company realized no increase in low carbon energy usage and achieved 86.1% of its waste diverted from landfill. \nThe Company anticipates spending between $400 million and $500 million on capital projects to achieve the Strive 35 targets. Through December 31, 2024, ADM has spent $297 million on projects in support of these goals since inception, of which $139 million was spent in 2024.\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nThe Company believes that protection of natural resources, habitats, and biodiversity are important to life and to the Company’s business. ADM is committed to eliminating deforestation from all of the Company’s supply chains in 2025. In 2023, after a strategic investigation of the impact of conversion of native habitats in its key supply chains, the Company announced its commitment to eliminate conversion of native habitats in high risk areas in South America for direct suppliers of all commodities in 2025 and indirect suppliers by 2027, with a 2025 cutoff date (a date after which conversion of primary native vegetation renders a given area or production unit non-compliant) for both direct and indirect suppliers. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company spent $64 million specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and in light of requirements of various environmental agencies.\nThere have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. \nADM’s corporate social investment program, ADM Cares, aligns the Company’s corporate giving with its business strategies and sustainability objectives. Through the program, ADM works to sustain and strengthen its commitment to communities where ADM colleagues work, live, and operate by directing funding to initiatives and organizations driving meaningful social, economic, and environmental progress. The ADM Cares team evaluates potential projects submitted for funding to ensure they meet eligibility criteria, such as initiatives that support food security, health and well-being, and sustainability around the world. \nAdditional Sustainability Disclosures\nProgram updates, scenario analysis, and metrics and targets are available in ADM’s Corporate Sustainability Report which can be accessed through its website at http://www.adm.com.\nReferences to the Company’s website address in this report are provided as a convenience, and information contained on, or available through, the website is not incorporated by reference. See Available Information section below for more information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has a responsibility to oversee that all ADM businesses within the Company follow responsible tax practices. ADM manages its tax affairs based upon the following key principles:\n–a commitment to paying tax in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates;\n–a commitment to the effective, sustainable, and active management of the Company’s tax affairs; and \n–developing and sustaining open and honest relationships with the governments and jurisdictions in which the Company operates regarding the formulation of tax laws.\nHuman Capital and Culture\nADM’s purpose of unlocking the power of nature to enrich the quality of life highlights the significant role ADM plays within an essential industry and the critical job each employee has within the Company.\nADM has long maintained its Code of Conduct to help the Company achieve the right results, the right way. The code establishes high standards of honesty and integrity for all ADM colleagues and business partners, and sets forth specific policies to further the Company’s commitment to conducting business fairly and ethically everywhere it operates.\nThe Company’s culture is grounded in its values of integrity, respect, excellence, resourcefulness, teamwork, and responsibility. ADM is a truly global company of approximately 44,000 employees working together to achieve extraordinary results.

ADM continues to develop its workforce to remain relevant and deliver on the Company’s growth aspirations. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nThe Company believes that cultivating an inclusive culture of care and continuous learning for our colleagues is a critical priority that assists ADM in its efforts to continue innovating, driving growth through customer focus, and delivering outstanding performance for shareholders. Part of ADM’s vision is to foster an inclusive culture with opportunities for all employees so that all members of its diverse, global workforce belong and make meaningful contributions to the success of each other and the Company. ADM holds an annual Global Week of Understanding, a signature week-long investment focused on continuous learning and strengthening ADM’s culture of belonging. The week features keynote presentations, training programs, roundtable sessions, and onsite activities that foster an environment where all can thrive, and diversity of perspectives are harnessed to fuel innovation and growth.\nIn support of ADM’s commitment to a productive, diverse, and inclusive workforce, ADM supports Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups where colleagues with shared experiences or interests can come together to build a sense of community and engage in personal and professional development. ADM’s ERGs are open to all employees and offer forums for fostering collaboration, connection and belonging. \nThe following tables set forth information about the Company’s employees as of December 31, 2024.\nNumber of Employees by Contract and Region\n\n                                       Salaried                    Hourly                  Part-Time                    Total\nNorth America                       10,034                    11,171                       215                     21,420    \nEMEA                                 5,985                     4,658                       540                     11,183    \nSouth America                        2,904                     4,511                       873                      8,288    \nAsia Pacific                         1,817                       805                        26                      2,648    \nCentral America/Caribbean              238                       260                         6         504                   \nTotal                               20,978                    21,405                     1,660                     44,043    \nNumber of Employees by Type and Gender\n\n                           Male         %                    Female         %           Total           %\nFull-time            31,799        75   %               10,584         25   %      42,383         100   %\nPart-time               672        40   %                  988         60   %       1,660         100   %\nTotal                32,471        74   %               11,572         26   %      44,043         100   %\nPercentage of Executive Council and Senior Leadership by Gender\n\n                                                                                                                                      Percentage\n2024                                                                                                                                        2023\n                             Male                  Female                Total                 Male                  Female                Total\nExecutive Council          69   %                 31    %              100   %               67   %                 33    %              100   %\nSenior Leadership          69   %                 31    %              100   %               69   %                 31    %              100   %\nCompensation and Benefits\nADM offers market-competitive pay, benefits, and services that help meet the needs of its employees.

Recruitment partnerships with a variety of organizations help ADM to engage with, support, recruit, and hire inclusively, from front line production associates, to interns, to college graduates that begin their career across ADM’s business units, functions and regions.\nADM prides itself in offering an array of career opportunities that include global assignments for its high potential talent, internal career growth for those who wish to learn more, and experiential learning through projects, mentorships, and on-the-job development.\nWorkplace Safety\nADM is committed to driving a safe and reliable culture that protects its people, its processes and the planet. By fostering a highly engaged workforce that is proactive and relentlessly focused on risk reduction, the Company aims to ensure every colleague returns home safely to their families and the things that matter most.\nIn 2024, approximately 76% of ADM’s sites completed the year with zero injuries and approximately 89% with no lost workday injuries. The Company’s Total Recordable Incident Rate and Lost Workday Incident Rate, based upon the number of incidents per 100 employees (or per 200,000 work hours), as defined by OSHA, for ADM colleagues (excluding unsupervised contractors) in 2024 were 0.68 and 0.23, respectively. Notably, the Decatur, Illinois complex achieved significant safety improvements in 2024, with zero fatalities or serious injuries. \nIn 2024, the Company had one ADM colleague fatality and nine serious injuries. The Company continues to take steps to further enhance the safety of its workplaces through occupational safety and process safety improvements and maintains a goal of zero fatalities. Through the guidance of the Environmental, Health, and Safety Technology Center, the Company is advancing impactful occupational and process safety initiatives, including:\n–Driving excellence in Life-Critical Standards \n–Encouraging proactive use of Stop Work Authority\n–Expanding Total Process Safety training at all organizational levels\n–Providing focused support to our highest-risk sites\nLooking ahead to 2025, ADM is focused on efforts to continue to reduce serious injuries and its total recordable injury rate while strengthening its culture of safety and reliability.\nBoard Diversity\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee strives to recommend nominees who reflect a diversity of background and experience with the necessary skills to effectively perform the functions of the Board and its committees, including the Board's role in overseeing ADM’s strategy and operations. As of December 31, 2024, 58% of ADM’s 12 board members identified as members of underrepresented groups – five are African-American, Hispanic or Asian, and four are women. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s website is http://www.adm.com.

      "text": "\nItem 1A.       RISK FACTORS      \nThe risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered. Any one or more of such risks could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price and could cause actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Company.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company is exposed to potential business disruption which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.\nThe assets and operations of the Company could be subject to unplanned downtime or extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include, but are not limited to, equipment failure, raw material shortages, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, fires, or other unexpected outages. The Company may not be able to resolve emergencies timely or effectively, and the associated liability which could result from these risks may not always be covered by or could exceed liability insurance. \nThe Company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services, the disruption of which could result in difficulties supplying materials to the Company’s facilities and impair the Company’s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner. The Company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively. In addition, if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials, such as water or certain chemicals used in the Company’s processing operations, are not available, the Company’s business could be disrupted. Any major lack of available water for use in certain of the Company’s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results. Certain factors which may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Company’s control including, but not limited to, disruptions resulting from weather, high or low river water conditions, economic conditions, border closures, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of materials, interruption of energy supply, and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions.\nTransportation, inflationary impacts, and fluctuations in energy prices could affect the Company’s operating results.\nThe Company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices, inflationary pressures, and certain logistic constraints. The Company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity, natural gas, and coal. The Company’s transportation operations are partially dependent upon rail access, diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. Significant increases in the cost or access of these items, including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases, could adversely affect the Company’s production costs and operating results. \nHuman capital availability may not be sufficient to effectively support global operations. \nADM’s global operations function with skilled individuals necessary for the processing, warehousing, and shipping of raw materials for products used in other areas of manufacturing or sold as inputs or products to third-party customers. The availability of skilled trade and production workers has been a specific focus for the manufacturing industry. The inability to properly staff manufacturing facilities with skilled trades and hourly labor due to a limited number of qualified resources could negatively impact operations.\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nThe Company may fail to realize the benefits of or experience delays in the execution of its growth strategy.\nAs the Company executes its growth strategy, through both organic and inorganic growth, it may encounter risks which could result in increased costs, decreased revenues, and delayed synergies. Growth in new geographies outside the U.S. can expose the Company to volatile economic, political, and regulatory risks that may negatively impact its operations and ability to achieve its growth strategy. Expanding businesses where the Company has limited presence may expose the Company to risks related to the inability to identify an appropriate partner or target and favorable terms, inability to retain/hire strategic talent, or integration risks that may require significant management resources that would have otherwise been available for ongoing growth or operational initiatives. Acquisitions may involve unanticipated delays, costs, and other problems. Due diligence performed prior to an acquisition may not identify a material liability or issue that could impact the Company’s reputation or adversely affect results of operations resulting in a reduction of the anticipated acquisition benefits. Additionally, acquisitions may involve integration risks such as: internal control effectiveness, system integration risks, the risk of impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangibles, ability to retain acquired employees, and other unanticipated risks. The Company may fail to realize the operational or financial benefits expected from acquisitions, which may impact the Company’s growth strategy.\nThe Company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures and may not be able to monetize the investments at an attractive value when the Company decides to exit the investments.\n\nThe Company has invested in or advanced funds to joint ventures and investments over which the Company has limited control as to governance and management activities (see Part II. Item 8. Note 8. Investments in and Advances to Affiliates for investment balances and related net sales amounts). Risks related to these investments may include: the financial strength of the investment partner; loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit; the inability to implement beneficial management strategies, including risk management and compliance monitoring, with respect to the investment’s activities; the risk that the Company may not be able to resolve disputes with the partners; and the risk that the Company may not realize the operational or financial benefits expected from the investment. The Company may encounter unanticipated operating issues, financial results, or compliance and reputational risks related to these investments. \nThe Company faces risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks.\nThe Company could be materially impacted in the future if a health epidemic, pandemic, or similar outbreak would arise causing severe disruptions. In such circumstances, ADM may be unable to perform fully on its contractual obligations, critical global supply chain and logistical networks may be affected, and costs and working capital needs may increase. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. In addition, demand for certain products that ADM produces, particularly biofuels and ingredients that go into food and beverages that support the food services channels, could be materially impacted from a prolonged regional or global outbreak, leading to government-imposed lockdowns, quarantines, or other restrictions.\nGeopolitical Risks\nThe Company faces risks related to international conflicts, acts of terrorism or war, or other geopolitical events, such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Hamas war, sanctions, maritime piracy, and other economic disruptions.\nADM’s assets and operations could be subject to extensive property damage, business disruption, loss in value, nationalization, and expropriation as a result of geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism (e.g. purposeful adulteration of the Company’s products), war, and piracy, as well as any sanctions or embargoes resulting from these events. The assets and operations located in the region affected by the war between Russia and Ukraine are at an increased risk of property damage, inventory loss, business disruption, and expropriation. In addition, the Company may not be able to realize any financial or other benefits from its investments in Russia due to ongoing sanctions or actions of the Russian government. The Black Sea region is a major exporter of wheat and corn to the world, and the disruption of supply may continue to cause volatility in volumes, prices, and margins of these commodities and related products. Further, there is a risk that ADM and its related parties could trade with a sanctioned partner due to the number of sanctions taken against Russia. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nTrade receivables may be at risk of higher defaults, and other third-party risks could affect ADM’s ability to obtain inputs if suppliers are unable to perform or face insolvency, as certain supplies may not be attainable due to sanctions and/or restrictions on cross-border payment transactions. The Company could be materially impacted if, in the worst-case scenario, the conflict in Ukraine advances to other countries. The risk to ADM’s business from the war in Israel could increase if it expands into other countries. As the Company continues to monitor geopolitical developments, shipping routes are adjusted accordingly as increased use of technology, including drones, has provided pirates with enhanced capabilities to identify and target vessels. Most attacks on ships in high-risk areas result in boarding, which poses significant safety and security risks to crew and cargo. Piracy and related maritime threats could negatively impact the Company. Crew extractions, potential ransom payments, lease obligations, and expenses related to rerouting vessels to circumvent high-risk areas may result in financial loss. Furthermore, disruptions in shipping schedules may be impacted for an extensive period. In these circumstances, trade policies and the Company’s critical global supply chain and logistical networks could be affected, impairing the Company’s ability to satisfy contractual obligations, and impacting working capital requirements. Insurance may not adequately cover these risks. In addition, provisions for certain products that ADM produces, particularly those that support the food services channels, could be materially impacted. \nPolitical instability and changes in trade policies could negatively impact the Company’s financial results.\nThe Company’s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary, fiscal, trade, and environmental policies, laws, regulations, and acquisition approvals, creating risks including, but not limited to: changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions; local labor conditions and regulations, and safety and environmental regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions on currency exchange activities; currency exchange fluctuations; burdensome taxes and trade tariffs; enforceability of legal agreements and judgments; adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes; and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the Company’s ability to transact business in these markets. The Company has historically benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the U.S. and other sources to markets around the world. Increases in tariff and restrictive trade policies around the world could negatively impact the Company’s ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets.\nInvestigation Risks\nThe Investigation and related events have had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nAs previously disclosed, following a voluntary document request from the SEC relating to intersegment sales between the Company’s Nutrition reporting segment and the Company’s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments, the Company conducted an internal investigation into certain accounting practices and procedures with respect to its Nutrition reporting segment, including as related to certain intersegment sales (the “Investigation”).\nThe Company had historically disclosed in the footnotes to its financial statements that intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market. In connection with the Investigation, the Company identified certain intersegment sales that occurred between the Company’s Nutrition reporting segment and the Company’s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments that were not recorded at amounts approximating market. The Company corrected those errors in its fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K, along with subsequently identified errors that the Company corrected in an amendment to its Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “FY2023 10-K/A”), and its Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of 2024, all of which were filed on November 18, 2024, to restate the segment disclosures included in those filings.\nAs a result of the Investigation, correction of identified errors and related events, the Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, a number of adverse impacts and risks, including, but not limited to:\n–the Company’s Board of Directors and senior management have been required to devote significant time to the Investigation, the correction of certain segment-specific historical financial information and related matters, resulting in potential management distraction from the operation of the business;\n–the price of the Company’s common stock has declined significantly, has been subject to fluctuations and could continue to fluctuate upon further announcements or actions;\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\n–the Company is facing securities litigation and could face additional litigation under federal and state securities laws or other claims arising from the Investigation, such litigation can be costly to defend, and if decided against the Company, such litigation could require the Company to pay substantial judgments or settlements;\n–the Company could discover additional material or immaterial errors in its financial statements; and\n–the three major credit rating agencies have maintained the Company’s credit ratings at investment grade levels with a negative outlook; however, if the ratings are downgraded, the Company’s access to the credit markets and its ability to fund its working capital and capital expenditures may be affected. \nThe risks described above have had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \nIn addition, although the Company has taken certain actions in response to the findings of the Investigation, the Company could take new or different actions in addition to those taken to date if it determines those actions are appropriate. Such actions are uncertain and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business and the price of its common stock.\nThe Company is subject to ongoing government investigations, and the timing for their resolution and outcome cannot be predicted.\nAs previously disclosed, and as described more fully in Part II. Item 8. Note 20. Legal Proceedings of this report, the Company is under investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) relating to, among other things, intersegment sales between the Company’s Nutrition reporting segment and the Company’s Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments. The Company cannot predict when the SEC and DOJ investigations will be completed, nor can it predict the results of these investigations with any reasonable degree of certainty. Expenses incurred in connection with these investigations (which include substantial fees of lawyers and other professional advisors and potential obligations to indemnify officers and directors who are parties to these investigations) could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and liquidity position. The Company may be required to pay material fines, consent to injunctions on future conduct or be subject to other penalties, each of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. These government investigations also may adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain, and/or increase the cost of obtaining, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and/or other types of insurance. In addition, the findings and outcomes of the Investigation as well as the government investigations could result in additional litigation or actions taken by third parties against the Company. The effects and results of such other litigation or actions may have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \nThe Company identified a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which could impact the Company’s ability to report its results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, in connection with the Investigation, the Company identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to the Company's accounting practices and procedures for segment disclosures. The material weakness resulted from inadequate controls that allowed for certain intersegment sales to be reported at amounts that were not in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Specifically, the Company did not have adequate controls in place around measurement of certain intersegment sales between the Company’s reporting segments. In addition, appropriate controls were not in place for the reporting of intersegment sales and for the application of disclosure requirements within ASC 280, Segment Reporting. For a more detailed description of this material weakness, see Part II. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this report. \nWhile the Company has implemented a remediation plan, the Company will not be able to conclude whether the steps the Company has taken will remediate the material weakness until a sustained period of time has passed to allow management to test the design and operational effectiveness of the new and enhanced controls.\nThe material weakness, if not fully addressed, could result in additional accounting errors, such as those resulting in the restatement of certain segment-specific historical financial information as described in the FY2023 10-K/A. The Company may be unable to remediate this material weakness in a timely manner, which could adversely impact the accuracy and timeliness of future reports and filings the Company makes with the SEC. Further, additional errors may be identified as a result of the Company's remediation efforts, or additional material weaknesses could be identified, any of which could result in additional corrections or adjustments, which may be material, or could impact the Company's ability to report its results of operations and financial condition in an accurate and timely manner. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nNegative publicity has and may continue to adversely affect the Company and the market price of its common stock.\nThe Company has become subject to negative publicity as a result of the Investigation and related events. Negative publicity and unfavorable perception of the Company has caused and could in the future cause significant declines in the price of the Company’s common stock. Negative publicity can also impact the terms under which some customers and suppliers are willing to continue to do business with the Company and affect the Company’s financial performance or financial condition. In addition, negative publicity or unfavorable perceptions make it more difficult for the Company and its employees to operate, resulting in reduced morale, a potential increase in employee turnover, and difficulty attracting talent. As a result, any new or ongoing negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, and the market price of the Company's common stock.\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance Risks\nThe Company may be impacted by carbon emission regulations in multiple regions throughout the globe.\nThe production of the Company’s products uses materials that can create emissions of certain regulated substances, including GHG emissions. Such regulated emissions also include indirect emissions that occur in the value chain as the result of activities from assets now owned or controlled by the Company. Several jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce GHG emissions impacting climate change and rising sea levels including, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, the United Kingdom, and China. In particular, the State of Illinois enacted legislation intended to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050 which includes the mandate for zero emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent and co-pollutants from electric generation using coal by 2030. It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements. Potential consequences of new obligations could include increased energy, transportation, raw material, and administrative costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment.\nOperations could be impacted by deforestation regulations, including the European Union (EU) deforestation-free regulation as part of the EU Green Deal, and by Brazil's Amazon soy moratorium.\nThe EU deforestation-free regulation's original effective date of December 2024 was formally postponed for one year. Soybeans and palm oil are the primary commodities covered by the regulation that will impact ADM due to the volume of those commodities that the Company imports into the EU. Failure to comply with the regulation could have serious consequences including civil, administrative, and criminal penalties, as well as negative impact on the Company’s reputation, business, cash flows, and results of operations. Adhering to these regulations is costly, and insufficient enforcement heightens operational risks. Removal or revisions of existing deforestation regulations creates risk due to ADM’s operational and technology costs incurred in its commitments to comply with such regulations, including ADM’s investment in Gradable.\nThe Company is committed to avoid sourcing from deforested areas. However potential disruptions to the Amazon soy moratorium due to changes in Brazilian legislation, could render the Company less competitive in the market and or damage the Company’s reputation. The Company is working to source responsibly while maintaining its market position.\nFood or feed risks derived from quality issues or off label product usage, occupational health and safety issues, and ineffective diversification programs may expose the Company to certain regulatory or reputational risks.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; socially acceptable and sustainable farming practices; environmental, health, and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims. The liability which could result from noncompliance and other risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the Company. Risks to the Company’s reputation may exist due to potential negative publicity caused by product liability, food safety, occupational health and safety, workforce diversity, and environmental matters. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nThe Company’s sustainable practices require oversight and robust monitoring requirements. The lack of unified reporting standards increases sustainability regulatory compliance and reporting requirements. \nThe Company has programs and policies in place (e.g., Corporate Sustainability Program; Commitment to Protecting Forests, Biodiversity and Communities; Environmental Policy; Strive 35 environmental goals; etc.) to expand responsible practices while reducing its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Implementation of these programs and policies sometimes requires the acquisition of technology or capital investments at a cost to the Company. Starting in 2026, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will require companies within the European Union to report extensive climate-related information for the 2025 financial year. The reporting requirements of CSRD, along with the growing multitude of corporate sustainability reporting standards, will result in increased compliance costs and could result in regulatory reporting risks as each standard will have its own required disclosures. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can have serious consequences, including civil, administrative, and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the Company’s reputation, business, cash flows, and results of operations. \nThe Company’s carbon capture and sequestration operations are also subject to potential risks and uncertainties, including complying with complex and evolving regulations, obtaining and maintaining permits and regulatory approvals, and managing operational challenges. \nFinancial Risks \nLimitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the Company’s operating results due to its capital-intensive nature.\nThe Company requires significant capital, including continuing access to credit markets, to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy. The Company’s working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly. The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets, and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations, and changing safety standards in the industry. Moreover, the expansion of the Company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. Access to credit markets and pricing of the Company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies. Strong credit ratings allow the Company to access cost-competitive tier one commercial paper markets. As of December 31, 2024, the three major credit rating agencies maintained the Company’s credit ratings at investment grade levels with a negative outlook. Further watches, reviews or downgrades could occur. If the Company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings, access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the Company’s current operations and its growth opportunities. \nStrategic and Economic Risks\nAgricultural commodities, agricultural commodity products, and non-agricultural commodity raw materials the Company procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises can be affected by various factors beyond the Company’s control.\nThe availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations, including impacts from factors outside the Company’s control such as changes in market conditions, weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, climate change, competition, and changes in global demand, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. Additionally, the Company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities.\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nReduced supply of agricultural commodities and rising costs of non-agricultural commodity raw materials could adversely affect the Company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limiting the Company’s ability to procure, transport, store, process, and merchandise agricultural commodities and products in an efficient manner. High and volatile commodity and non-agricultural commodity prices can place more pressures on short-term working capital funding. Conversely, if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles, price volatility is somewhat diminished. This could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities. \nThe Company has certain finished products, such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products, or in the case of ethanol, blended into gasoline to increase octane content. Therefore, the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other octane enhancers. A significant decrease in the price of gasoline, diesel fuel, or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the Company’s ethanol and biodiesel. The Company may use derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases and sales of commodities to protect itself in the near term against price changes and to protect and maximize processing margins, but there can be no assurance that any derivative contracts entered into by the Company will have those effects. \nThe Company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.\nThe Company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas. While 64% of the Company’s long-lived assets are in the United States, the Company also has significant operations in both developed areas (such as Western Europe and Canada) and emerging market areas. One of the Company’s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model, which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas. Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns, including decreased demand for the Company’s products, and reduced availability of credit, or declining credit quality of the Company’s suppliers, customers, and other counterparties. In addition, emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including, but not limited to, logistics limitations or delays, labor-related challenges, epidemic outbreaks and economic recovery, limitations or regulations affecting trade flows, local currency concerns, and other economic and political instability. Political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets, potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes, fees, increased risks of corruption, etc. Economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and ability to execute its long-term business strategies, although the nature of many of the Company’s products (i.e. food and feed ingredients) is less sensitive to demand reductions in any economic downcycle. \nThe Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates and is subject to industry-specific risks which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.\nThe Company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors, who can be different depending upon each of the business segments in which it participates. The Company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as raw materials, transportation services, and other materials and supplies, as well as for workforce and talent. Competition impacts the Company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors: \n–Pricing of the Company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity on-line, build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation;\n–Many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and, in many cases, subject to substitution; \n–Significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries, could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than U.S. products;\n–Improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the Company has a significant presence; and\n–Continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry, especially when acquirers are state-owned and have profit and return objectives that may differ from private sector enterprises. \nThe Company is subject to industry-specific risks which include but are not limited to: launch of new products by other industries that can replace the functionalities of the Company’s production; shifting consumer preferences; and product safety and quality. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nIn the case of the Nutrition business, while maintaining efficient and cost-effective operations are important, the ability to drive innovation and develop quality nutritional and wellness solutions for human and animal needs are key factors to remain competitive in the nutrition market. Certain of the Company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed. The Company is subject to risks associated with economic, product quality, feed safety or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses, including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry, for example African swine fever, which could adversely affect demand for the Company’s products used as ingredients in feed. In addition, ADM’s investment in the flavors and ingredients businesses exposes the Company to risks related to innovation, adaptation, and product claims to meet the changing requirements of its customers. \nThe Company’s risk management strategies may not be effective.\n\nThe Company has a Chief Risk Officer who oversees the ERM Program and regularly reports to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee, which assists the Board in its oversight of the Company's ERM program, on the myriad of risks facing the Company and the Company’s strategies for mitigating those risks. The Company’s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity markets. The Company’s risk monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure, and such exposure could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. \nRegulatory Risks\nThe Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations, and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and forward strategy.\nThe Company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in over 180 countries, and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the United States federal government as well as state, local, and non-U.S. governmental authorities in numerous areas including: accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, privacy and security, environmental, product compliance and safety, and handling and production of regulated substances. The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due including questions regarding the timing, amount of deductions, the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which ADM operates may enact changes to their tax rules. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the “OECD”), the European Union, and other countries (including countries in which the Company operates) have committed to enacting substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. \nIn particular, the OECD’s Pillar Two initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis. While it appears unlikely the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, certain countries in which ADM operates have enacted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing draft legislation to implement the minimum tax directive. Certain aspects of Pillar Two were effective for ADM during the year ended December 31, 2024 with additional components becoming effective beginning in the year ended December 31, 2025. In the U.S., under U.S. GAAP, Pillar Two taxes are considered an alternative minimum tax accounted for as a period cost that will impact the effective tax rate in the year the Pillar Two tax obligation arises. As such, deferred taxes will not be recognized or adjusted for the estimated effects of future minimum taxes. While at this time we do not expect the impact of Pillar Two to be material to our consolidated financial statements in 2025, there is no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate, financial results, or cash flows in future periods. \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump issued executive orders that the OECD Global Tax Deal has no force and effect in the U.S., and to investigate foreign countries’ compliance with tax treaties and to prepare a list of options for protective measures the U.S. should adopt in response. Our analysis is ongoing as the OECD continues to release additional guidance, countries enact legislation, and the potential U.S. response. To the extent additional legislative changes take place in the countries in which we operate, it is possible that these changes may yield an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, financial results. and cash flows. \nChanges in administration or shifts in legislative priorities may lead to alterations in the U.S. tax code or may potentially influence the global tax landscape and the Company's compliance requirements related to tariffs and sanctions. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nThe Company is subject to the EU Network and Information Security (NIS2) directive, which aims to enhance cybersecurity across the EU by establishing more stringent requirements for a broader range of sectors and entities. Although NIS2 has not yet been fully implemented, the Company is proactively working with relevant authorities and stakeholders in various countries as they enact the directive. NIS2 mandates that organizations implement robust cybersecurity measures, including formal business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) plans, to ensure resilience against cyber threats. Non-compliance with these regulations could result in significant fines, legal penalties, and operational disruptions. \nAny failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies, including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation. \nRegulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries; regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses; and taxation polices could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.\nAgricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, regulations, and trade agreements, including taxes and tax credits, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, and import and export restrictions, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, traceability standards, sustainable practices, product safety and labeling, renewable fuels, low carbon fuel mandates, and technology related to energy production and/or emissions reductions. These policies can influence the planting of certain crops; the location and size of crop production; whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded; the volume and types of imports and exports; the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials; the viability and volume of production of certain of the Company’s products; and industry profitability. For example, changes in government policies, tax credits, and/or regulation of ethanol and biodiesel, including, but not limited to, the Clean Fuels Production Tax Credit and the Renewable Fuel Standard under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States, including the treatment of small refinery exemptions, can have an impact on the Company’s operating results. International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions. Regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the Dodd-Frank Act, Consumer Protection Act, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, and could adversely affect the Company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices. Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Company’s products; adversely affect the Company’s ability to deploy adequate hedging programs; restrict the Company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets; and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.\nThe Company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, expanding its value-added product portfolio, and expanding the sustainable agriculture programs and partnerships it participates in. Government policies including, but not limited to, antitrust and competition law, trade restrictions, food safety regulations, sustainability requirements, and traceability, can impact the Company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully.\nTechnological Risks\nThe Company’s inability to successfully complete its ongoing implementations of new enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and upgrades of its information technology (IT) systems could have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and operational results.\nThe Company is currently upgrading its IT platforms, including certain ERP systems, on a global scale, with these upgrades expected to occur in phases over the next several years. These upgrades include making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality, and building new policies, procedures, training programs and monitoring tools. The Company is also engaged in implementations of new ERP systems which has required and will continue to require significant investments of human and financial resources. The Company’s strategy for pursuing these upgrades and implementations will likely evolve over time and may increase the time or expense involved in completing these projects. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nIn implementing new ERPs, the Company may experience significant increases to inherent costs and risks associated with changing and acquiring these systems, policies, procedures and monitoring tools, including capital expenditures, additional operating expenses, demands on management time and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to or integrating new systems policies, procedures, or monitoring tools into its current systems. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of any ERP may adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate its business, or maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. These implementations, modifications and upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at a level that outweighs the costs of implementation, or at all. In addition, difficulties with implementing new technology systems, such as ERPs, delays in the Company’s timeline for planned improvements, significant system failures or the Company’s inability to successfully modify its IT systems, policies, procedures or monitoring tools to respond to changes in its business needs in the past have caused and in the future may cause disruptions in the Company’s business operations, increase security risks, including the risk of cybersecurity breaches, and may have a material and adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology systems are subject to interruptions or failures which may affect the Company’s ability to conduct its business.\n\nThe Company’s operations rely on certain key IT systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data connectivity, information, and services for internal and external users. These interactions include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; risk management activities; converting raw materials to finished products; inventory management; shipping products to customers; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting financial results of operations; human resources benefits and payroll management; and complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements. Additionally, legacy technologies are used to support significant business functions. The instability of aging legacy systems could diminish performance and elevate the risk of system failures, reduce compatibility with modern software, and impact growth initiatives. \nThe Company’s IT systems, processes, and sites may suffer cybersecurity breaches, which could expose the Company to operational and various regulatory risks.\nIncreased IT security and social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the Company’s IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company’s third-party data. The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding artificial intelligence (AI), privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. Compliance with and interpretation of various data privacy regulations continue to evolve, and any violation could subject the Company to legal claims, regulatory penalties, and damage to its reputation. \nIf the Company’s IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Company’s recovery efforts do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the Company may suffer significant interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, actual or threatened legal actions, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the Company’s revenues, operating results, and financial condition.\nGenerative AI advancements are progressing at an unprecedented pace, which brings risks that could subject the Company to loss through various technical, legal, and opportunistic-related risks.\nThe Company continues to advance in the development and integration of AI systems across its operations. AI technologies introduce a range of potential risks and challenges as detailed below. \nEthical and Bias Risks \nAI systems often rely on large datasets, which can inadvertently introduce bias if the data is not sufficiently diverse or representative leading to AI-driven decisions that may be unfair or discriminatory, potentially harming both individuals and our brand reputation. \nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\n\nData Security and Privacy \nAI systems rely heavily on vast amounts of data, which could include sensitive personal or proprietary information. If not managed and protected properly, AI systems could become targets for data breaches, exposing critical information to unauthorized access. \nRegulatory and Legal Compliance \nAI technology is evolving rapidly with governments and regulatory bodies around the world beginning to introduce new requirements, guidelines, and frameworks to ensure the responsible use of AI. There is a risk that emerging regulations may require costly and complex compliance adjustments to our AI systems. Furthermore, legal challenges related to intellectual property, liability for AI-driven decisions, and potential misuse of AI present significant risks. \nOperational Risks and Reliability \nAI systems may fail to perform as expected under certain conditions or become vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate the AI’s output. As AI becomes more integrated into our operations, the risks of system failure or malfunction increase, potentially disrupting our business processes. \nTalent and Resource Challenges \nThe rapid pace of AI development requires specialized talent and resources to ensure the successful design, implementation, and maintenance of AI systems. The shortage of skilled AI professionals presents a risk to our ability to effectively develop and leverage AI technologies. Additionally, the complexity of AI systems demands continuous investment in research and development, which could strain resources and impact other areas of the business.",
