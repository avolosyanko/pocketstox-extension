      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nWe are a global biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes clinically differentiated medicines that provide benefits to children and adults living with rare disorders. Our ability to innovate to identify new therapies and to globally commercialize products is the foundation that drives investment in a robust and diversified pipeline of transformative medicines. Our mission is to provide access to best-in-class treatments for patients who have little to no treatment options. Our strategy is to leverage our strong scientific and clinical expertise and global commercial infrastructure to bring therapies to patients. We believe that this allows us to maximize value for all of our stakeholders.\nOur Pipeline\nWe have a diversified therapeutic portfolio that includes several commercial products and product candidates in various stages of development, including discovery, research and clinical stages, focused on the development of new treatments for multiple therapeutic areas for rare diseases relating to neurology and metabolism. The disclosure below summarizes the status of our significant clinical-stage programs and commercial products as of the date of this report, including those with our strategic partners:\n\n●   Global Commercial Footprint\n-------------------------------\n\no   Global DMD Franchise – We have two products, TranslarnaTM (ataluren) and Emflaza® (deflazacort), for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or DMD, a rare, life-threatening disorder. Translarna currently has conditional marketing authorization in the European Economic Area, or EEA, for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy, or nmDMD, in ambulatory patients aged two years and older. In January 2024, the Committee of Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, issued a negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure. In May 2024, the European Commission, or EC, decided not to adopt the CHMP’s negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna and returned such opinion to the CHMP for re-evaluation. In June 2024, following the EC’s request for re-review, the CHMP issued a negative opinion on the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. On October 18, 2024, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following the requested reexamination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the EC has 67 days from the date of issuance to adopt the opinion. At this time, the EC has not yet adopted the negative opinion. If the EC adopts the negative opinion, Translarna would no longer have marketing authorization in the member states of the EEA. The marketing authorization for Translarna remains in effect, pending the EC’s potential adoption of the negative opinion. We are exploring other potential mechanisms by which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA if the negative opinion is adopted by the EC. Translarna also has marketing authorization in Russia for the treatment of nmDMD in patients aged two years and older, and in Brazil for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients two years and older and for continued treatment of patients that become non-ambulatory, as well as in various other countries as described below. Emflaza is approved in the United States for the treatment of DMD in patients two years and older.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n6\n\n\n\n\no   UpstazaTM (eladocagene exuparvovec) / KebilidiTM (eladocagene exuparvovec-tneq) – Upstaza, a gene therapy for the treatment of Aromatic L-Amino Decarboxylase, or AADC, deficiency, a rare central nervous system, or CNS, disorder is approved for the treatment of AADC deficiency for patients 18 months and older within the EEA and the United Kingdom. In November 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted accelerated approval for this gene therapy for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States. This gene therapy is marketed with the brand name Kebilidi in the United States.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no   Tegsedi® (inotersen) and Waylivra® (volanesorsen) – We hold the rights for the commercialization of Tegsedi and Waylivra for the treatment of rare diseases in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean pursuant to our Collaboration and License Agreement with a subsidiary of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis. Tegsedi has received marketing authorization in the United States, European Union, or EU, and Brazil for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis. Waylivra is approved in Brazil for the treatment of familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, and familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no   Evrysdi® (risdiplam) – Evrysdi, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of SMA in adults and children of all ages and by the EC for the treatment of 5q SMA in patients of all ages with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four SMN2 copies. Evrysdi has also received marketing authorization for the treatment of SMA in over 100 countries. Evrysdi is a product of our SMA program and our collaboration with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffman-La Roche Inc., which we refer to collectively as Roche, and the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation, or SMA Foundation.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\n\n●   Diversified Development Pipeline\n------------------------------------\n\no   Sepiapterin – Sepiapterin is our product candidate for the treatment of phenylketonuria, or PKU. In May 2023, we announced that the primary endpoint was achieved in our registration-directed Phase 3 trial for sepiapterin for phenylketonuria, or PKU. In March 2024, we submitted a marketing authorization application, or MAA, to the EMA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in the EEA, which was validated and accepted for review by the EMA in May 2024. We expect an opinion from the CHMP in the second quarter of 2025. In July 2024, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for sepiapterin for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with PKU, including the full spectrum of ages and disease subtypes, in the United States. In September 2024, the FDA accepted for filing the NDA, with a target regulatory action date of July 29, 2025. We also made regulatory submissions for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in Brazil in the third quarter of 2024 and in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a regulatory decision in Japan expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no   Splicing Platform – In addition to our SMA program, our splicing platform also includes PTC518, which is being developed for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, or HD. We initiated a Phase 2 study of PTC518 for the treatment of HD in the first quarter of 2022, which consists of an initial 12-week placebo-controlled phase focused on safety, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic effects followed by a nine-month placebo-controlled phase focused on PTC518 biomarker effect. In June 2023, we announced interim data from the 12-week placebo-controlled phase of the Phase 2 study of PTC518. In June 2024, we announced interim results from the full Phase 2 study of PTC518. In September 2024, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the PTC518 program for the treatment of HD. In December 2024, we held a Type C meeting with the FDA to discuss whether huntingtin protein lowering could be considered a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval of PTC518. The FDA was aligned on the scientific rationale and asked to see additional data supportive of an association between huntingtin protein lowering and changes in clinical outcome scores. We expect to provide results from the Phase 2 study of PTC518 for the treatment of HD in the second quarter of 2025. In November 2024, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, relating to our PTC518 program, or the Novartis Agreement. Pursuant to the Novartis Agreement, we will continue to conduct the ongoing Phase 2A Clinical Trial and the ongoing open label extension, or OLE, Clinical Trial pursuant to its existing development plan, with the goal of transitioning the ongoing OLE Clinical Trial to Novartis within 12 months after the effective date of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis will be responsible for all other development of licensed compounds and licensed products and the manufacture and commercialization of licensed compounds and licensed products worldwide.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n7\n\n\n\n\no   Inflammation and Ferroptosis Platform – The most advanced molecule in our inflammation and ferroptosis platform is vatiquinone. We announced topline results from a registration-directed Phase 3 trial of vatiquinone in children and young adults with Friedreich’s ataxia, or FA, called MOVE-FA, in May 2023. While the trial did not meet its primary endpoint, vatiquinone treatment did demonstrate significant benefit on key disease subscales, including the upright stability subscale, as well as on other disease relevant endpoints. In the first quarter of 2024, we met with the FDA, who expressed willingness to review an NDA for vatiquinone for the treatment of FA, based on the MOVE-FA trial as well as data from the ongoing OLE study following the MOVE-FA trial, potentially allowing for the submission of an NDA in late 2024. In October 2024, we announced that the pre-specified endpoint for two different FA long-term extension studies was met, with statistically significant evidence of durable treatment benefit on disease progression. In December 2024, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for vatiquinone for the treatment of children and adults living with FA. In February 2025, the FDA accepted for filing the NDA and granted priority review with a target regulatory action date of August 19, 2025.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\n\n●   Pre-clinical Pipeline\n-------------------------\n\no   We continue to invest in our pre-clinical product pipeline by committing resources to research and development programs to provide access to best-in-class treatments for patients who have an unmet medical need. Our pre-clinical efforts are focused on two scientific platforms: splicing and inflammation and ferroptosis, two areas of science where PTC has significant expertise.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGlobal Commercial Footprint\nGlobal DMD Franchise\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)\nMuscular dystrophies are genetic disorders involving progressive muscle wasting and weakness. DMD is the most common and one of the most severe types of muscular dystrophy. DMD occurs when a mutation in the dystrophin gene prevents the cell from making a functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is a muscle membrane associated protein and is critical to the structural and membrane stability of muscle fibers in skeletal, diaphragm and heart muscle. The absence of normally functioning dystrophin results in muscle fragility, such that muscle injury occurs when muscles contract or stretch during normal use. As muscle damage progresses, connective tissue and fat replace muscle fibers, resulting in inexorable muscle weakness.\nBecause the dystrophin gene is located on the X chromosome, DMD occurs primarily in young boys, although approximately 10% of female carriers show some disease symptoms. DMD is rare, and estimates of occurrence include approximately 1 in every 3,500 live male births, according to the National Organization for Rare Diseases and approximately 1 in every 5,000 live male births according to Ryder (2017) in the European Journal of Human Genetics. We estimate that there are between approximately 10,000 to 15,000 DMD patients in the United States. Several different types of mutation in the dystrophin gene can result in DMD, including deletion, duplication and nonsense mutations. A test known as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) can detect large deletions and duplications, which account for approximately 75% of all mutations. However, gene sequencing is required to identify small mutations such as nonsense mutations. We estimate that nonsense mutations account for approximately 13% of cases of DMD. Without treatment, patients with DMD typically lose walking ability by their early teens, require ventilation support in their late teens, and eventually experience premature death due to heart and lung failure. Even with medical care, most people with DMD die from cardiac or respiratory failure before or during their 30s.\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nMarketing authorization matters\nTranslarna for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy\nEuropean Economic Area\nWe received marketing authorization from the EC in August 2014 for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged five years and older in the member states of the EEA, subject to annual renewal and other conditions. In July 2018, the EC approved a label-extension request to our marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA to include patients from two to up to five years of age. In July 2020, the EC approved the removal of the statement “efficacy has not been demonstrated in non-ambulatory patients” from the indication statement for Translarna.\nThe marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the EC following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of continued authorization, which we refer to as the annual EMA reassessment. In September 2022, we submitted a Type II variation to the EMA to support conversion of the conditional marketing authorization for Translarna to a standard marketing authorization, which included a report on the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041 and data from the open-label extension as further described below. In February 2023, we also submitted an annual marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA. In September 2023, the CHMP gave a negative opinion on the conversion of the conditional marketing authorization to full marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and a negative opinion on the renewal of the existing conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In January 2024, the CHMP issued a negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure. In May 2024, the EC decided not to adopt the CHMP’s negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna and returned such opinion to the CHMP for re-evaluation. In June 2024, following the EC’s request for re-review, the CHMP issued a negative opinion on the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In October 2024, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following the requested reexamination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the EC has 67 days from the date of issuance to adopt the opinion. At this time, the EC has not yet adopted the negative opinion. If the EC adopts the negative opinion, Translarna would no longer have marketing authorization in the member states of the EEA. The marketing authorization for Translarna remains in effect, pending the EC’s potential adoption of the negative opinion. We are exploring other potential mechanisms by which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA if the negative opinion is adopted by the EC.\nMarketing authorization is required in order for us to engage in any EEA-wide commercialization of Translarna in the EEA, which allows us to participate in pricing and reimbursement negotiations, on a country-by-country basis with each country in the EEA. Individual countries in the EEA have the ability to make Translarna available under early access programs, or EAP programs, or through similar styled programs. There is substantial risk that if the EC adopts the CHMP’s negative opinion or we are otherwise unable to renew our EEA marketing authorization during any annual renewal cycle or we are unable to identify other potential mechanisms in which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA should the CHMP’s negative opinion be adopted by the EC or our product label is materially restricted, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna in the EEA and other territories. For more information regarding the risks associated with a potential EC adoption of the CHMP’s negative opinion on Translarna’s marketing authorization, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “We may be unable to continue to commercialize Translarna for nmDMD in the EEA if the EC adopts the negative opinion issued by the CHMP for the renewal of the existing conditional authorization for Translarna.”\nSee “Item 1. Business-Commercial Matters-Market Access Considerations” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for further information regarding the marketing authorization in the EEA, the market access process and related risks.\nAs the marketing authorization holder, we are obligated to monitor the use of Translarna for nmDMD to detect, assess and take required action with respect to information that could impact the safety profile of Translarna and to report this information, through pharmacovigilance submissions, to the EMA. Following its assessment of these submissions, the \n\n\n9\n\n\n\nEMA can recommend to the EC actions ranging from the continued maintenance of the marketing authorization to its withdrawal.\nUnited States\nTranslarna is an investigational new drug in the United States. During the first quarter of 2017, we filed an NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD over protest with the FDA. In October 2017, the Office of Drug Evaluation I of the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, for the NDA, stating that it was unable to approve the application in its current form. In response, we filed a formal dispute resolution request with the Office of New Drugs of the FDA. In February 2018, the Office of New Drugs of the FDA denied our appeal of the CRL. In its response, the Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for our ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness and safety of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production in nmDMD patients’ muscles. We followed the FDA’s recommendation and collected, using newer technologies via procedures and methods that we designed, such dystrophin data in a new study, Study 045, and announced the results of Study 045 in February 2021. Study 045 did not meet its pre-specified primary endpoint. In June 2022, we announced top-line results from the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041, which was our 18 months, placebo-controlled trial, followed by an 18 months open label extension, of Translarna in the treatment of ambulatory patients with nmDMD aged five years or older. Following this announcement, we submitted a meeting request to the FDA to gain clarity on the regulatory pathway for a potential re-submission of an NDA for Translarna. The FDA provided initial written feedback that Study 041 does not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness to support NDA re-submission. We held a Type C meeting with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 to discuss the totality of Translarna data. Based on feedback from the FDA, we re-submitted the NDA in July 2024, based on the results from Study 041 and from our international drug registry study for nmDMD patients receiving Translarna. In October 2024, the FDA accepted for review the resubmission of the NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. As this was an NDA resubmission following a CRL to the NDA which was filed over protest in 2016, the FDA is not obligated to follow the review timelines under Prescription Drug User Free Act, or PDUFA, guidelines and an action date has not been provided.\nSee “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-The new drug and biologic approval process” below for further discussion with respect to the NDA process. See “Item 1. Business-Translarna (ataluren)” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Products and our Product Candidates” for further detail regarding the results of our completed trials and studies of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, our regulatory strategy in the United States, our history with submissions to the FDA and the related risks to our business.\nOther Territories\nTranslarna received marketing authorization for the treatment of nmDMD in Israel and South Korea in 2015, Chile in 2018, Brazil in 2019 and Russia in 2020, in addition to approvals from other countries, and these licenses are currently active. Many territories outside of the EEA, including Israel, South Korea and Chile, reference and depend on the determinations by the EMA when considering the grant of a marketing authorization. It is possible that we would not be able to maintain our marketing authorizations in these regions in the event the EMA decides not to renew or otherwise modifies or withdraws our marketing authorization in the EEA. In addition, Translarna is authorized in the United Kingdom and is undergoing a national assessment. The marketing authorization for Translarna in Brazil and Russia are subject to renewal every five years. We have been pursuing and expect to continue to pursue marketing authorizations for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in other regions.\nEmflaza for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the United States\nEmflaza, both in tablet and suspension form, received approval from the FDA in February 2017 as a treatment for DMD in patients five years of age and older in the United States. In June 2019, the FDA approved our label expansion request for Emflaza for patients two to five years of age. We estimate that there are between approximately 10,000 and 15,000 DMD patients in the United States.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nEmflaza received a seven-year marketing exclusivity period in the United States for its approved indications, commencing on the date of FDA approval, under the provisions of the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, or the Orphan Drug Act. We have previously relied on this exclusivity period to commercialize Emflaza in the United States. Emflaza’s seven-year period of orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older expired in February 2024. We expect the expiration of this orphan drug exclusivity to have a significant negative impact on Emflaza net product revenue. Emflaza’s orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients two years of age to less than five expires in June 2026. See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation” for further discussion with respect to marketing protection we rely on.\nUpstaza / Kebilidi\nUpstaza/Kebilidi is an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy for the treatment of AADC deficiency, a rare CNS disorder arising from reductions in the enzyme AADC that results from mutations in the dopa decarboxylase gene. In July 2022, the EC approved Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency for patients 18 months and older within the EEA. In November 2022, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency approved Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency for patients 18 months and older within the United Kingdom. On November 13, 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval of our gene therapy for the treatment of children and adults with AADC deficiency, which is marketed with the brand name Kebilidi in the United States. We are obligated to complete certain post-marketing requirements in connection with the FDA's approval, including clinical safety studies.\nAADC is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of L-dopa to dopamine. Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter that acts within the striatum (caudate and putamen), a component of the brain’s deep grey matter, to modulate output of neurons that project to the motor and premotor cortices of the brain that plan and execute normal motor function. Dopamine is required in the brain for humans to develop and maintain proper motor function.\nAADC deficiency is a monogenic disorder of neurotransmitter synthesis that manifests in young children and most commonly results in profound developmental delay, often seen as complete arrest of motor development. AADC deficiency generally causes the inability to develop motor control, resulting in breathing, feeding, and swallowing problems, frequent hospitalizations, and the need for life-long care. On average, patients with AADC deficiency die in the first decade of life due to profound motor dysfunction and secondary complications such as choking, hypoxia, and pneumonia. Currently, no treatment options are available for the underlying cause of the disorder, and care is limited to palliative options with significant burden on caregivers.\nThe prevalence of AADC deficiency has been estimated to be approximately 5,000 patients worldwide, with a live-birth incidence of up to 1 in 40,000 worldwide. While several diagnostic tests for AADC deficiency are available, we believe the condition remains largely undiagnosed or misdiagnosed and may be confused with cerebral palsy.\nPatients are treated with Upstaza/Kebilidi during a single procedure in which the gene therapy is administered directly to the region of the brain, called the putamen, where dopamine is made and released. The targeted micro-dosing approach administering small amounts of gene therapy directly to focal regions of affected cells in the putamen has the benefit of keeping the supply requirements for materials low, improving access of the therapeutic gene to key cells, potentially limiting immune and complement-mediated responses and reducing the risk of off-target uptake and excretion of the gene therapy by the liver and kidneys.\nUpstaza and Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC deficiency has orphan drug designation in the EU and United States, respectively. Due to its orphan medicinal product designation by the EMA, we rely on a ten-year exclusive marketing period for Upstaza in the EEA, which may potentially be extended for two additional years if we receive approval for a pediatric exclusivity incentive. Kebilidi has a twelve-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for the approved indication, commencing on the date of FDA approval, under the provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as well as a concurrent seven-year exclusive marketing period, under the provisions of the Orphan Drug Act. We rely on the twelve-year BPCIA regulatory exclusivity and concurrent seven-year Orphan Drug Act exclusivity to commercialize Kebilidi in the United States, which we expect to expire in November 2036 and November 2031, respectively.\n\n\n11\n\n\n\nSee “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-The new drug and biologic approval process” below for further discussion with respect to the Biologics License Application, or BLA, process.\nTegsedi and Waylivra\nIn August 2018 we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Akcea Therapeutics, Inc., or Akcea, a subsidiary of Ionis for the commercialization by us of Tegsedi, Waylivra and products containing those compounds in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, or the PTC Territory. See “Item 1. Business-Our Collaborations, License Agreements and Funding Arrangements-Tegsedi and Waylivra” below for further discussion with respect to this collaboration and license agreement.\nTegsedi\nTegsedi, a product of Ionis’ proprietary antisense technology, is an antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, inhibitor of human transthyretin, or TTR, production. Tegsedi is the world’s first RNA-targeted therapeutic to treat patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis. In October 2019, it received marketing authorization from ANVISA, the Brazilian health regulatory authority, for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis in Brazil. Our marketing authorization for Tegsedi in Brazil is subject to renewal every five years. It has also received marketing authorization in the United States and EU for the same indication.\nhATTR amyloidosis is a progressive, systemic and fatal inherited disease caused by the abnormal formation of the TTR protein and aggregation of TTR amyloid deposits in various tissues and organs throughout the body, including in peripheral nerves, heart, intestinal tract, eyes, kidneys, central nervous system, thyroid and bone marrow. The progressive accumulation of TTR amyloid deposits in these tissues and organs leads to sensory, motor and autonomic dysfunction often having debilitating effects on multiple aspects of a patient’s life. Patients with hATTR amyloidosis often present with a mixed phenotype and experience overlapping symptoms of polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy.\nUltimately, hATTR amyloidosis generally results in death within three to fifteen years of symptom onset. Therapeutic options for the treatment of patients with hATTR amyloidosis are limited and there are currently no disease-modifying drugs approved for the disease. There are an estimated 50,000 patients with hATTR amyloidosis worldwide, including approximately 6,000 patients with polyneuropathic hATTR amyloidosis in Latin America.\nWaylivra\nWaylivra is an ASO that has received marketing authorization in the EU for the treatment of FCS, subject to certain conditions. The United States and EU regulatory agencies have granted orphan drug designation to Waylivra for the treatment of FCS. In connection with the marketing approval for Waylivra in the EU, the EC is requiring Akcea to provide results of a study based on a registry of patients to investigate how blood checks and adjustments to frequency of injections are carried out in practice and how well they work to prevent thrombocytopenia and bleeding in FCS patients taking Waylivra. In August 2021, ANVISA approved Waylivra as the first treatment for FCS in Brazil. Our marketing authorization for Waylivra in Brazil is subject to renewal every five years.\nFCS is an ultra-rare disease caused by impaired function of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, or LPL, and characterized by severe hypertriglyceridemia (>880mg/dL) and a risk of unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis. Because of limited LPL function, people with FCS cannot break down chylomicrons, lipoprotein particles that are 90% triglycerides. In addition to pancreatitis, FCS patients are at risk of chronic complications due to permanent organ damage. They can experience daily symptoms including abdominal pain, generalized fatigue and impaired cognitions that affect their ability to work. People with FCS also report major emotional and psychosocial effects including anxiety, social withdrawal, depression and brain fog. There is no effective therapy for FCS currently available.\nAdditionally, we received approval of Waylivra for the treatment of FPL in Brazil in December 2022. FPL is a rare genetic metabolic disease characterized by selective, progressive loss of body fat (adipose tissue) from various areas of the body leading to ectopic fat deposition in liver and muscle and development of insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia and fatty liver disease. Individuals with FPL often have reduced subcutaneous fat in the arms and legs and the head and trunk \n\n\n12\n\n\n\nregions may or may not have loss of fat. Conversely, affected individuals may also have excess subcutaneous fat accumulation in other areas of the body, especially the neck, face and intra-abdominal regions.\nEvrysdi\nEvrysdi was approved by the FDA in August 2020 for the treatment of SMA in adults and children two months and older and by the EC in March 2021 for the treatment of 5q SMA in patients two months and older with a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 or with one to four SMN2 copies. Evrysdi has also received marketing authorization for the treatment of SMA in over 100 countries. In May 2022, the FDA approved a label expansion for Evrysdi to include infants under two months old with SMA. In August 2023, the EC approved an extension of the Evrysdi marketing authorization to include infants under two months old in the EU. Evrysdi is a product of our SMA program and our collaboration with Roche and the SMA Foundation. For additional information, see “Item 1. Business – Our Collaborations, License Agreements and Funding Arrangements – Roche and the SMA Foundation.”\nSMA is a genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by muscle wasting and weakness. The disease generally manifests early in life. SMA is caused by mutation or deletion of the Survival of Motor Neuron 1, or SMN1, gene that encodes the survival of motor neuron, or SMN, protein. The SMN protein is critical to the health and survival of the nerve cells in the spinal cord responsible for muscle contraction. A second gene, Survival of Motor Neuron 2, or SMN2, is very similar to SMN1, contains a T nucleotide at position 6 in exon 7 and produces low, insufficient levels of functional SMN protein due to alternative splicing of exon 7. According to the SMA Foundation, SMA is the leading genetic cause of death in infants and toddlers. Approximately 1 in 10,000 children is born with the disease. We estimate that there are between 20,000 to 30,000 children and adults living with SMA in the United States, Europe and Japan.\nDiversified Development Pipeline\nOur pipeline includes a number of programs at various stages of development including sepiapterin, PTC518 and other programs from our splicing and inflammation and ferroptosis platforms. Additionally, we have ongoing clinical studies of our current commercial product for maintaining authorizations and enabling additional authorizations.\nSepiapterin\nSepiapterin is a precursor to intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin, which is a critical enzymatic cofactor involved in metabolism and synthesis of numerous metabolic products. Sepiapterin has been pursued as a possible treatment for orphan metabolic diseases associated with defects in the tetrahydrobiopterin biochemical pathways, including PKU. PKU is an inborn error of metabolism caused predominantly by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene resulting in toxic buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine, or Phe, in the brain, and, if left untreated, severe and irreversible disabilities such as permanent intellectual disability, seizures, delayed development, behavioral problems and possibly psychiatric disorders can occur. We believe that there are approximately 58,000 PKU patients globally. In May 2023, we announced that the primary endpoint was achieved in our registration-directed Phase 3 trial for sepiapterin for PKU. The primary endpoint of the study was the achievement of statistically-significant reduction in blood Phe level. The primary analysis population included those patients who have a greater than 30% reduction in blood Phe levels during the Part 1 run-in phase of the trial. Sepiapterin demonstrated Phe level reduction of approximately 63% in the overall primary analysis population and Phe level reduction of approximately 69% in the subset for classical PKU patients. Additionally, sepiapterin was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Following the placebo-controlled study, patients were eligible to enroll in a long-term open-label study, which is still ongoing and will evaluate long-term safety, durability and Phe tolerance. In March 2024, we submitted an MAA to the EMA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in the EEA, which was validated and accepted for review by the EMA in May 2024. We expect an opinion from the CHMP in the second quarter of 2025. In July 2024, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with PKU, including the full spectrum of ages and disease subtypes, in the United States. In September 2024, the FDA accepted for filing the NDA, with a target regulatory action date of July 29, 2025. We also made regulatory submissions for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in Brazil in the third quarter of 2024, and in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a regulatory decision in Japan expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n\n13\n\n\n\nSplicing Platform\nOur splicing platform focuses on the development of innovative therapies for diseases of unmet medical need that may be ameliorated through the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. \nIn addition to Evrysdi and our SMA program, our splicing platform also includes PTC518, which is being developed for the treatment of HD. HD is a neurodegenerative and progressive brain disorder caused by a toxic gain-of-function triplet repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene resulting in uncontrolled movements and cognitive loss. There are currently no disease-modifying therapies approved to delay the onset or slow the progression of HD. We believe that there are approximately 135,000 HD patients globally. PTC518 is an orally bioavailable molecule with broad central nervous system and systemic distribution that has been designed to reduce huntingtin protein expression with high selectivity and specificity. We announced the results from our Phase 1 study of PTC518 in healthy volunteers in September 2021 demonstrating dose-dependent lowering of huntingtin messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels, that PTC518 efficiently crosses blood brain barrier at significant levels and that PTC518 was well tolerated. We initiated a Phase 2 study of PTC518 for the treatment of HD in the first quarter of 2022, which consists of an initial 12-week placebo-controlled phase focused on safety, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic effects followed by a nine-month placebo-controlled phase focused on PTC518 biomarker effect. In June 2023, we announced interim data from the 12-week placebo-controlled phase of the Phase 2 study of PTC518. The study demonstrated dose-dependent lowering of huntingtin, or HTT, protein levels in peripheral blood cells, reaching an approximate mean 30% reduction in mutant HTT levels at the 10mg dose level. In addition, PTC518 exposure in the cerebrospinal fluid was consistent with or higher than plasma unbound drug levels. Furthermore, PTC518 was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events. In June 2024, we announced interim results from the full Phase 2 study of PTC518. At month 12, PTC518 treatment demonstrated durable dose-dependent lowering of mutant HTT, or mHTT, protein in the blood and dose-dependent lowering of mHTT protein in the cerebrospinal fluid in the interim cohort of stage 2 patients. In addition, favorable trends were demonstrated on several relevant HD clinical assessments. Furthermore, following 12 months of treatment, PTC518 continued to be well tolerated. In September 2024, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to the PTC518 program for the treatment of HD. In December 2024, we held a Type C meeting with the FDA to discuss whether huntingtin protein lowering could be considered a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval of PTC518. The FDA was aligned on the scientific rationale and asked to see additional data supportive of an association between huntingtin protein lowering and changes in clinical outcome scores. We expect to provide results from the Phase 2 study of PTC518 for the treatment of HD in the second quarter of 2025.\nIn November 2024, we entered into the Novartis Agreement, relating to our PTC518 HD program which included related molecules. This transaction closed in January 2025. Pursuant to the Novartis Agreement, we will continue to conduct the ongoing Phase 2A Clinical Trial and the ongoing OLE Clinical Trial pursuant to its existing development plan, with the goal of transitioning the ongoing OLE Clinical Trial to Novartis within 12 months after the effective date of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis will be responsible for all other development of licensed compounds and licensed products and the manufacture and commercialization of licensed compounds and licensed products worldwide. For additional information, see “Item 1. Business – Our Collaborations, License Agreements and Funding Arrangements – Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.”\nInflammation and Ferroptosis Platform\nOur inflammation and ferroptosis platform consists of small molecule compounds that target oxidoreductase enzymes that regulate oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways central to the pathology of a number of CNS diseases. Oxidation-reduction, or redox, reactions are an essential component of the generation and regulation of energy in living systems. These reactions are regulated through a set of enzymes known as oxidoreductase enzymes that uniquely require the transfer of an electron, or a redox chemical reaction, to affect their biological activity. \nOne of the advanced molecules in our inflammation and ferroptosis platform is vatiquinone. Vatiquinone is a small molecule orally bioavailable compound that has been in development for inherited mitochondrial diseases and related genetic disorders of oxidative stress. Vatiquinone targets 15-lipoxygenase, or 15-LO, a key regulator of oxidative stress, lipid-based neuro-inflammation, alpha-synuclein oxidation and aggregation and cell death. We are developing vatiquinone for the treatment of FA. FA is a rare and life-shortening neurodegenerative disease caused by a single defect in the FXN \n\n\n14\n\n\n\ngene which causes reduced production of the frataxin protein. We believe that there are approximately 25,000 FA patients globally, including approximately 6,000 in the United States, of which approximately one-third are pediatric. Vatiquinone has previously been studied in FA patients in a Phase 2 trial that included a six-month placebo-controlled phase followed by an 18-month open label extension. In this trial, long-term vatiquinone treatment (18-24 months) was associated with an improvement in overall disease severity and neurological function relative to natural history. Vatiquinone has been generally well-tolerated in the clinic.\nWe announced topline results from our MOVE-FA trial, a registration-directed Phase 3 trial of vatiquinone in children and young adults with FA, in May 2023. While the trial did not meet its primary endpoint of statistically significant change in modified Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale, or mFARS, score at 72 weeks in the primary analysis population, vatiquinone treatment did demonstrate significant benefit on key disease subscales and secondary endpoints. In addition, in the population of subjects that completed the study protocol, significance was reached in the mFARS endpoint and several secondary endpoints, including the upright stability subscale. Furthermore, vatiquinone was well tolerated. In the first quarter of 2024, we met with the FDA, who expressed willingness to review an NDA for vatiquinone for the treatment of FA based on the MOVE-FA trial as well as data from the ongoing open label extension study following the MOVE-FA trial. In October 2024, we announced that the pre-specified endpoint for two different FA long-term extension studies was met, with statistically significant evidence of durable treatment benefit on disease progression. In December 2024, we submitted an NDA to the FDA for vatiquinone for the treatment of children and adults living with FA. In February 2025, the FDA accepted for filing the NDA and granted priority review with a target regulatory action date of August 19, 2025.\nIn November 2024, we announced that the global Phase 2 placebo-controlled CardinALS study of utreloxastat for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, did not meet its primary endpoint of slowing disease progression on the composite ALSFRS-R and mortality analysis. Due to the lack of efficacy and biomarker signal, further development of utreloxastat for the treatment of ALS is not planned at this time.\nTranslarna (ataluren)\nWe discovered Translarna by applying our technologies to identify molecules that promote or enhance the suppression of nonsense mutations. Nonsense mutations are implicated in a variety of genetic disorders. Nonsense mutations create a premature stop signal in the translation of the genetic code contained in mRNA and prevent the production of full-length, functional proteins. Based on our research, we believe that Translarna interacts with the ribosome, which is the component of the cell that decodes the mRNA molecule and manufactures proteins, to enable the ribosome to read through premature nonsense stop signals on mRNA and allow the cell to produce a full-length, functional protein. As a result, we believe that Translarna has the potential to be an important therapy for genetic disorders which are the result of a nonsense mutation. Genetic tests are available for many genetic disorders, including those noted above, to determine if the underlying cause is a nonsense mutation. Translarna has been generally well-tolerated in all of our clinical trials, which have enrolled over 1,000 individuals to date.\nPlanned and ongoing clinical development of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy\nObservational study, data collection, and open label, extension trials of Translarna for treatment of nmDMD\nWe are undertaking a multi-center, observational post-approval study of patients receiving Translarna on a commercial basis, or Study 025o, as required by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the EMA and in collaboration with TREAT-NMD and the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group. During the study we will gather data on the safety, effectiveness, and prescription patterns of Translarna in routine clinical practice. We have successfully enrolled more than 300 patients in Study 025o and we expect to follow their progress over five years.\nAn open label, extension trial, Study 016, involving patients who participated in ACT DMD is also ongoing, across multiple sites in the United States and Canada with patients on commercial supply. We ended the two open label extension trials involving patients who had participated in our prior trials for nmDMD and have transitioned U.S. and Canadian patients from these trials to Study 016 while other patients have transitioned to commercial supply via commercial pathways or EAP programs.\n\n\n15\n\n\n\nCompleted clinical trials of Translarna in nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy\nPhase 2 pediatric study\nAs part of our pediatric development commitments under our marketing authorization in the EEA and to support the potential expansion of the Translarna label to younger patients with nmDMD, we initiated a Phase 2 pediatric clinical study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of Translarna in patients two to five years of age. The study, initiated in June 2016, included a four-week screening period, a four-week study period, and a 48-week extension period for patients who complete the four-week study period (52 weeks total treatment). In July 2018, the EMA approved a label-extension request to our marketing authorization for Translarna in the EEA to include patients from two to up to five years of age, based on data from this study.\nPhase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for nmDMD (ACT DMD)\nIn October 2015, we announced results from ACT DMD, also referred to as Study 020, our Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 48-week clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with nmDMD. ACT DMD involved 228 patients at 53 sites across 18 countries.\nIn the overall intent-to-treat, or ITT, study population, the primary endpoint of change from baseline at week 48 in the 6MWT, showed a 15 meter benefit in favor of Translarna, which did not meet statistical significance.\nA summary of the safety and efficacy results from ACT DMD is outlined below.\nSafety and tolerability.   The results of ACT DMD confirmed the favorable safety profile of Translarna seen in our 48-week, 174-patient Phase 2b double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of Translarna in patients with nmDMD completed in 2009, or the Phase 2b trial.\nTranslarna was generally well tolerated at both dose levels in our Phase 2b clinical trial. There were no study discontinuations due to adverse events. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Investigators’ attributions of drug-related adverse effects were generally similar across the placebo and Translarna arms. The most common adverse events in this trial were vomiting (46.6% overall), headache (29.3%), diarrhea (24.1%), nasopharyngitis (20.7%), fever (19.0%), cough (19.0%) and upper abdominal pain (17.8%). These events were generally balanced across treatment arms and are typical of pediatric illnesses. Adverse events with at least a 10% incidence in any treatment arm that were seen with increased frequency from the placebo group to the Translarna 40 mg dose group to the Translarna 80 mg dose group were nausea (12.3% for placebo, 14.0% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 16.7% for the Translarna 80 mg group), abdominal pain (7.0% for placebo, 12.3% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 16.7% for the Translarna 80 mg group), pain in extremity (10.5% for placebo, 12.3% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 13.3% for the Translarna 80 mg group), flatulence (7.0% for placebo, 8.8% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 11.7% for the Translarna 80 mg group) and nasal congestion (7.0% for placebo, 8.8% for the Translarna 40 mg group and 10.0% for the Translarna 80 mg group). There were no serious adverse events observed during the trial that were considered possibly or probably related to Translarna. Determination of relatedness of the serious adverse event to Translarna was made by the trial investigator, based on his or her judgment.\nTranslarna was generally well tolerated in ACT DMD. There were two study discontinuations due to adverse events, including one in the Translarna arm (constipation) and one in the placebo arm (disease progression). Most treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common adverse events in this trial were vomiting (20.4% overall), nasopharyngitis (20.0%), headache (18.3%), and fall (17.8%). These events were generally balanced across treatment arms and are typical of pediatric illnesses and/or patients with DMD. Adverse events with at least a 10% incidence in either treatment arm that were seen with increased frequency from the placebo group to the Translarna 40 mg dose group were vomiting (18.3% for placebo, 23.6% for the Translarna 40 mg group), nasopharyngitis (19.1% for placebo, 20.9% for the Translarna 40 mg group), fall (17.4% for placebo, 18.3% for the Translarna 40 mg group), cough (11.3% for placebo, 16.5% for the Translarna 40 mg group) diarrhea (8.7% for placebo, 17.4% for the Translarna 40 mg group), and pyrexia (10.4% for placebo, 13.9% for the Translarna 40 mg group).

Determination of relatedness of the serious adverse event to Translarna was made by the trial investigator, based on his or her judgment.\nIntent to Treat (ITT) Population.   The primary efficacy endpoint in ACT DMD was change in 6-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, from baseline to week 48. In the ITT population, a 15 meter benefit (p=0.213) was observed in the primary endpoint which did not meet statistical significance.\nSecondary endpoints in the trial included the proportion of patients with at least 10% worsening in 6MWD at week 48 of the trial compared to baseline, or 10% 6MWD worsening, and change in timed function tests of time to run/walk 10 meters, climb four stairs and descend four stairs. The hazard ratio for Translarna versus placebo was 0.75 (p=0.160) for 10% 6MWD worsening. Benefits trended in favor of Translarna over placebo in the timed function tests in the ITT population, including observed results in time to run/walk 10 meters (1.2 seconds; p=0.117), time to climb four stairs (1.8 seconds; p=0.058), and time to descend four stairs (1.8 seconds; p=0.012).\nAdditional endpoints included the North Start Ambulatory Assessment, or NSAA, test, a functional scale designed for boys affected by DMD, and the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument, or PODCI, a validated tool for measuring quality of life in pediatric patients with orthopedic conditions. These additional endpoints favored Translarna in the ITT population but did not meet statistical significance.\nPre-Specified Analyses.   The statistical analysis plan submitted to the FDA for ACT DMD set forth pre-specified analyses of efficacy to be conducted, including subgroups of patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters and patients with baseline 6MWD of greater than or equal to 300 and less than 400 meters, which we refer to as our key subgroups.\nThe pre-specification of our key subgroups was scientifically justified based upon knowledge of the biology and natural history of the disease and the evolving understanding of the of the six minute walk test as used to assess DMD patients. We considered the pre-specified less than 350 meter baseline 6MWD population as a key subgroup based on the knowledge that 350 meters represents a transition point for patients towards a more rapid decline in walking ability as supported by analysis from our Phase 2b trial. Furthermore, we considered the pre-specified 300 to 400 meter baseline 6MWD population as a key subgroup based on an increasing understanding of the sensitivity limitations of the six minute walk test as an endpoint in 48-week studies. Natural history data suggest that the 6MWT may not be the optimal tool to demonstrate efficacy in patients with either a baseline 6MWD of less than 300 meters, as these patients have significant muscle loss as monitored by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and are at high risk for losing ambulation regardless of \n\n\n17\n\n\n\ntreatment, or in high walking patients, such as those with a baseline 6MWD at or greater than 400 meters, as these patients are likely to remain stable over a 48 week testing period.\nBy defining these key subgroups, we thereby also defined corresponding subgroups of patients with baseline 6MWD greater than or equal to 350 meters, greater than or equal to 400 meters, and less than 300 meters. We also pre-specified a meta-analysis of the combined results from ACT DMD and the Phase 2b ambulatory decline phase patients.\nPre-specified sub-group analysis. We saw strong evidence of clinical benefit in the pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline 6MWD between 300 and 400 meters. Specifically, we observed a benefit in Translarna-treated patients of 47 meters (nominal p=0.007) in the 6MWT in this subgroup. This was consistent with an observed benefit of 49 meters (nominal p=0.026) in our Phase 2b clinical trial in the 300 to 400 meters baseline 6MWD population. We also saw clinically meaningful benefit for Translarna over placebo in each of the timed function tests, including observed results in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.1 seconds; nominal p=0.066), time to climb four stairs (3.6 seconds; nominal p=0.003), and time to descend four stairs (4.3 seconds; nominal p<0.001). The hazard ratio for Translarna versus placebo was 0.79 (nominal p=0.418) for 10% 6MWD worsening. In addition, a benefit of 4.5 points over placebo (nominal p=0.041) was observed in the NSAA test, which we believe is clinically meaningful. We believe that the benefits observed in this key pre-specified subgroup support the use of the 6MWT in the patients with a walking ability in the 300 to 400 meters range and the understanding that the reliability of the 6MWT over a 48 week period was limited at both the lower and upper ends of our 6MWD enrollment range.\nIn the pre-specified subgroup of patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters, we observed a benefit of 24 meters (nominal p=0.210) in favor of Translarna in the 6MWT. An analysis of the results from our Phase 2b clinical trial in the less than 350 meters baseline 6MWD population, defined post-hoc, demonstrated a 68 meter benefit in the 6MWT (nominal p=0.006). In the timed function tests for the subgroup of ACT DMD patients with baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters, we observed benefits for Translarna over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.3 seconds; nominal p=0.033), time to climb four stairs (4.2 seconds; nominal p=0.019) and time to descend four stairs (4.0 seconds; nominal p=0.007).\nTypically, a trial result is statistically significant if the chance of it occurring when the treatment is like placebo is less than one in 20, resulting in a p-value of less than 0.05. A nominal p-value is the result of one particular comparison when more than one comparison is possible, such as when two active treatments are compared to placebo or when two or more subgroups are analyzed.\nAs described above, we believe the 6MWT lacks sensitivity to detect a clinical effect in patients with baseline less than 300 meters in a 48-week trial. However, the timed function tests trended in favor of patients treated with Translarna with a baseline 6MWD below 300 meters, including observed benefit over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.5 seconds; nominal p=0.066), time to climb four stairs (2.4 seconds; nominal p=0.790), and time to descend four stairs (2.1 seconds; nominal p=0.595). We believe the positive trends in this population reflect that short muscle burst activity tests may be a better clinical measure for patients that are at a more advanced stage of disease progression. Consistent with the natural history of ambulatory DMD patients with 6MWD greater than 400 meters, which indicates stability in walking ability over a 48 week period, we observed no meaningful difference in 6MWT between patient groups. Similarly, we observed no meaningful difference in 6MWT between patient groups with baseline 6MWD greater than 350 meters.\nPre-specified meta-analysis.   The meta-analysis combined efficacy results from the ACT DMD ITT population and Phase 2b ambulatory decline phase subgroup. The Phase 2b ambulatory decline phase group includes the patients from our randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with nmDMD who would have met the enrollment criteria of ACT DMD.\nResults from the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant 21 meter improvement in 6MWD (p = 0.015) favoring Translarna.\nAdditionally, the meta-analysis showed statistically significant benefit for Translarna over placebo across each timed function test including time to run/walk 10 meters (1.4 seconds; p=0.025), time to climb four stairs (1.6 seconds; p =0.018) and time to descend four stairs (2.0 seconds; p=0.004). The hazard ratio for Translarna versus placebo was 0.66 (p=0.023) for 10% 6MWD worsening. We believe that we are able to demonstrate a statistically significant outcome in the 6MWD \n\n\n18\n\n\n\nin the meta-analysis, despite the significant variability in baseline 6MWD among patients in both ACT DMD and the Phase 2b trial’s ambulatory decline phase, due to the substantially larger patient population available in the pooled analysis.\nRetrospective Analysis.   We also looked back at the observed results in the meta-analysis for all patients with a baseline 300 to 400 meter 6MWD from ACT DMD and the Phase 2b trial. The meta-analysis of these data demonstrated a 45 meter benefit (nominal p<0.001) in the 6MWT as well as clinically meaningful benefits across each secondary endpoint timed function test, including benefit over placebo in time to run/walk 10 meters (2.2 seconds; nominal p=0.008), time to climb four stairs (3.4 seconds; nominal p<0.001) and time to descend four stairs (4.3 seconds; nominal p<0.001). This meta-analysis of patients with baseline 6MWD of 300 to 400 meters was not pre-specified and is defined post-hoc.\nA retrospective analysis performed after unblinding trial results can result in the introduction of bias if the analysis is inappropriately tailored or influenced by knowledge of the data and actual results. In addition, nominal p-values cannot be compared to the benchmark p-value of 0.05 to determine statistical significance without being adjusted for the testing of multiple dose groups or analyses of subgroups. Because of these limitations, regulatory authorities typically give greatest weight to results from pre-specified analyses and adjusted p-values and less weight to results from post-hoc, retrospective analyses and nominal p-values.\nStatistical Considerations.   The pre-specified meta-analysis results, which favored Translarna in the 6MWT and each of the timed function tests, are considered statistically significant. In the pre-specified subgroups of ACT DMD patients with a baseline 6MWD less than 350 meters and 300 to 400 meters, the p-values for the 6MWT and each of the timed function tests are considered nominal. For information with respect to the use of nominal p-values and post-hoc analyses, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “Subgroup, retrospective, post-hoc, and certain statistical analyses may not be reliable and typically will not form the basis for regulatory approval.”\nParticipation Criteria and Stratification.   Certain key inclusion criteria were specified in the ACT DMD trial protocol for enrollment: the patient had to be 7 through 16 years of age; at the screening visit the patient had to be able to walk no more than 80% of predicted 6MWD compared to healthy boys matched for age and height, but had to be able to walk at least 150 meters during the 6MWT; and the patient must have used systemic corticosteroids for a minimum of six months prior to start of treatment. The ACT DMD trial protocol provided for the exclusion of patients from the trial if, among other things, they recently used systemic aminoglycoside antibiotics, recently initiated or changed corticosteroid therapy or previously received Translarna treatment. Patients enrolled in ACT DMD underwent 48 weeks of blinded treatment prior to the final analysis and the randomization was stratified based on age (<9 years versus ≥9), baseline 6MWD (<350 versus ≥350 meters), and duration of prior use of corticosteroids (<12 months versus ≥12 months).\nStudy 045\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, following the FDA’s recommendation to collect dystrophin data using validated quantification methods, we initiated Study 045, a Phase 2 open label clinical study of 20 boys with nmDMD from ages two to seven, to evaluate the ability of ataluren to increase dystrophin protein levels in boys with nmDMD. Study 045 did not meet its pre-specified primary endpoint. Patients received baseline biopsies prior to the initiation of treatment and follow-up biopsies scheduled at 40 weeks following the start of treatment. However, certain patients were delayed in obtaining the final study muscle biopsies performed at our clinical trial site at the University of California, Los Angeles as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 8 of 20 patients were unable to undergo biopsies at week 40, and these patients had their second biopsies between 62 and 70 weeks of treatment. Full-length dystrophin levels were measured using both the Electrochemiluminescence, or ECL assay, as the primary endpoint and Immunohistochemistry, or IHC, assay as the secondary endpoint. \nThe ITT population included the 20 patients enrolled in the study. However, one subject was determined to be non-compliant, as he only took half of the study drug, and one subject did not have adequate biopsy samples to establish baseline levels. Therefore, 18 patients were compliant with the study drug and had evaluable biopsy samples. These 18 patients are considered the evaluable population. 10 of these 18 patients had their second biopsy at week 40 and 8 had their second biopsy between weeks 62 and 70. Patient characteristics, including age and steroid use were consistent across both cohorts.\n\n\n19\n\n\n\nOverall in the ITT population, there was an increase in dystrophin expression from baseline, on both ECL as the primary endpoint and IHC as the secondary endpoint, but these did not meet a p-value of <0.05. Nevertheless, when studying the 18 patients in the evaluable cohort, we identified a greater increase in dystrophin expression, and this increase did reach a nominal p-value of 0.04 in the analysis of the IHC assay. Also, over 80% of the evaluable subjects demonstrated an increase in dystrophin expression. 8 patients in the evaluable population had longer treatment exposure, ranging from 62-70 weeks, and these 8 patients had markedly greater levels of dystrophin increase with an average of approximately 24% in the ECL assay. We believe that these results suggest that longer duration of treatment resulted in greater biological effect, which is consistent with the long-term Translarna treatment benefit we have previously reported from our other clinical studies and our international drug registry study for nmDMD patients receiving Translarna.\nWe also measured creatine kinase, or CK, levels of patients in Study 045 as an objective measure of muscle damage. Dystrophin acts as a shock absorber during a muscle contraction and would be expected to protect against muscle damage and therefore reduce CK levels. Consistent with an increase in the level of dystrophin, we observed a marked reduction of approximately 20% in creatine kinase and that longer treatment with Translarna was associated with a greater magnitude of biological effect.\nStudy 041\nOverview. As a specific obligation to our marketing authorization in the EEA, we were required to conduct and submit to the EMA the results of a three-year clinical trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of Translarna in the treatment of ambulatory patients with nmDMD aged five years or older. The trial was comprised of two stages: an 18-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial followed by an 18-month open label extension period. We refer to the 18-month clinical trial portion as “Stage 1” and the 18-month extension period as “Stage 2”. We refer to Stage 1 and Stage 2 together as Study 041. In September 2022, as part of our specific obligation, we submitted a report on Stage 1 and data from Stage 2 in connection with a Type II variation to the EMA to support conversion of the conditional marketing authorization for Translarna to a standard marketing authorization.\nFor a discussion of the risks related to conducting clinical trials, in general, and Study 041, in particular, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Products and our Product Candidates”.\nEnrollment. According to the study protocol, Study 041 enrolled nmDMD patients aged five years and above who achieve a 6MWD equal to or greater than 150 meters at three pre-treatment evaluation times (screening, baseline day one and baseline day two), tested as set forth in the protocol. Qualified participants also needed to perform timed function tests of running/walking 10 meters, climbing/descending four stairs and standing from supine within 30 seconds at both screening and baseline, and meet the other criteria set forth in the protocol.\nWe completed enrollment of Study 041 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Of the 363 patients enrolled in Study 041, 185 patients meet the criteria for inclusion in the primary analysis population, which we refer to as the modified intention-to-treat population, or mITT. Patients included in the mITT must be at least 7, but less than 16, years old, with a 6MWD of equal to or greater than 300 meters and a stand from supine time of five seconds or more, each as tested at screening and baseline.\nObjectives and endpoints. The primary objective of Study 041 was to evaluate the effect of Translarna on ambulation and endurance as assessed by the 6-minute walk test, or 6MWT. Based on the study protocol, the primary analysis of Stage 1 was to evaluate the difference in slope of change in 6MWD from baseline to week 72 between Translarna and placebo in the mITT population. Data from participants who did not qualify for inclusion in the mITT were used for summary and analysis of efficacy endpoints in the ITT (full date set) population.\nA secondary objective of Study 041 was to determine the effects of Translarna on ambulation and burst activity as assessed by timed function tests (10-meter run/walk, 4-stair stair-climb, and 4-stair stair descend). Each timed function test was analyzed as a secondary endpoint for both the mITT and ITT populations at the end of Stage 1 and was also analyzed at the end of Stage 2. A separate analysis evaluates 10-meter run/walk results in participants with a baseline 6MWD below 300 meters. An additional analysis evaluates a composite endpoint of average change in times to run/walk 10 meters, climb \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n4 stairs, and descend 4 stairs. We also assess each of time to loss of ambulation, stair-climbing and stair-descending over 72 weeks and over 144 weeks.\nDetermination of the effects of Translarna on lower-limb muscle function as assessed by the NSAA test, serves as an additional secondary objective. NSAA scores were analyzed as secondary endpoints for both the mITT and ITT populations at the end of Stage 1 and were also analyzed as at the end of Stage 2. A separate analysis for Stage 2 evaluated changes in total score in participants with a baseline 6MWD of equal to or greater than 400 meters and under 7 years of age. We also assessed the risk of loss of NSAA items over 72 weeks and 144 weeks.\nSlope of change in 6MWD over 144 weeks was also assessed as a secondary endpoint at the conclusion of Stage 2. Changes in 6MWD from baseline to week 72 and week 144 respectively were also addressed as secondary endpoints. \nThe safety profile of Translarna was evaluated throughout Stage 1 and Stage 2 as a secondary objective.\nCertain exploratory endpoints were also assessed in Study 041. In patients aged 7 years and above, change from baseline in upper limb function is assessed using both functional testing and parent/caregiver-reported questionnaires. In patients under 7 years of age, muscle strength was assessed by change from baseline in myometry parameters. At pre-qualified sites only, magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess change from baseline in muscle fat fraction. The effects of Translarna on pulmonary function were assessed by change from baseline in forced vital capacity. In addition, subject- and parent/caregiver-reported questionnaires and at-home diaries were assessed to evaluate the effect of Translarna on health-related quality of life (HRQL) changes from baseline.\nStratification. In Stage 1, participants were randomized 1:1 to placebo or Translarna (10, 10, 20 mg/kg). The randomization was stratified based on type of concomitant corticosteroid used at baseline (deflazacort versus prednisone/prednisolone), maximum of the two valid 6-minute walk tests performed at baseline day 1 and day 2 (<300 meters versus ≥300 to <350 meters, versus ≥350 to <400 meters, versus ≥400 meters), and time to stand from supine at baseline (<5 seconds versus ≥5 seconds).\nResults. In June 2022, we announced top-line results from Stage 1. Within Stage 1, Translarna showed a statistically significant treatment benefit across the entire ITT population as assessed by the 6MWT as assessed by the NSAA. Additionally, Translarna showed a statistically significant treatment benefit across the ITT population within the 10-meter run/walk and 4-stair stair climb, while also showing a positive trend in the 4-stair stair descend although not statistically significant. Within the mITT population, Translarna demonstrated a positive trend across all endpoints, however, statistical significance was not achieved. Translarna was also well tolerated with no new safety findings noted.\nMulti-platform Discovery\nWe continue to invest in our pre-clinical product pipeline by committing resources to research and development programs to provide access to best-in-class treatments for patients who have an unmet medical need. \nOur Approach\nWe use multiple drug discovery platforms to discover and develop therapies to target diseases with high-unmet need. Our platforms focus on identifying small molecules that intervene in pathways required for RNA processing and energy production. Careful control and manipulation of these processes allow us to address a wide range of deficiencies.\nSplicing\nPost-transcriptional control processes are the events that occur in a cell following the transcription of DNA into RNA. These processes regulate, for example, how long RNA molecules last in the cell, how exons in precursor messenger RNA, or pre-mRNA, molecules are spliced, and how efficiently mRNA molecules are translated to proteins. In the majority of human protein-encoding genes, the sequence encoding the mature mRNA transcript is not contiguous in the pre-mRNA but rather has intervening non-coding regions called introns that interrupt the coding sequences, called exons. These introns \n\n\n21\n\n\n\nare removed from the final mRNA product by a process called splicing that also joins the exons together such that only the exons are retained in the mature mRNA.\nApproximately 94% of all human genes encode pre-mRNAs that undergo splicing, as such the majority of the human genome is targetable with splicing modulation. PTC’s proprietary splicing discovery platform, PTSeekTM, identifies small molecules that modulate splicing of specific exons in genes of therapeutic interest, including genes associated with SMA, HD and various forms of cancer. Using this technology, we have successfully identified orally bioavailable small molecules that correct splicing of SMN2 mRNA. An example of one of these molecules is Evrysdi, which was approved in August 2020 by the FDA for the treatment of SMA in adults and children two months and older. Based on our knowledge of the mechanism of splicing and how small molecules interact with the cellular splicing machinery, we have identified additional small molecule drug candidates that modify splicing of pre-mRNA, promote inclusion of specific exons into mRNA, including pseudoexons, or force skipping of undesired exons from the mature mRNA. We believe that this technology is potentially widely applicable to a large number of target genes across many therapeutic areas.\nInflammation and Ferroptosis\nEnergy production in cells is critical to their survival. On the other hand, processes that induce oxidative stress in cells can negatively impact cell survival. Energy production takes place in a part of the cell called mitochondria. The mitochondria use the transport of electrons via chemical reactions called redox reactions in their cell membranes to produce adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which is the central energy molecule inside cells. This process of moving electrons to produce ATP is termed electron transfer or transport. The redox reactions, however, can also cause oxidative stress. We use our expertise in energy production via electron transfer chemical reactions and in oxidative stress to develop potentially first-in-class therapeutics for unmet medical needs. One area of our focus is on inherited mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial diseases often derive from defects in energy production and oxidative stress pathway. These diseases commonly result in severe neurological impairment and death at an early age. Through our screening processes, we have identified multiple drug targets which we are assessing in nonclinical studies with the aim of identifying additional product candidates to take into clinical development. Similar strategies potentially can be used for broader sets of diseases. We believe such approaches to these types of intractable diseases have the potential to lead to novel therapies to address areas of high unmet medical need.\nOur Collaborations, License Agreements and Funding Arrangements\nWe currently have ongoing collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation for SMA, a license agreement with National Taiwan University, or NTU, for Upstaza, a collaboration and license agreement with Akcea for Tegsedi and Waylivra, a license agreement with Shiratori Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Shiratori, relating to the manufacturing processes and technology for sepiapterin, and a license and collaboration agreement with Novartis for our PTC518 HD program.\nRoche and the SMA Foundation\nOverview.   In November 2011, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Roche and the SMA Foundation, dated as of November 23, 2011, or the SMA License Agreement, to further develop and commercialize compounds identified under our SMA sponsored research program with the SMA Foundation and to research other small molecule compounds with potential for therapeutic use in patients with SMA. The research term of this agreement was terminated effective December 31, 2014. The ongoing collaboration is governed by a joint steering committee consisting of an equal number of representatives of us, the SMA Foundation and Roche. We, the SMA Foundation and Roche have agreed to endeavor to make decisions by consensus, but if the joint steering committee cannot reach agreement after following a specified decision resolution procedure, Roche’s decision will control. However, Roche may not exercise its final decision-making authority with respect to certain specified matters, including any decision that would increase our or the SMA Foundation’s obligations, reduce our or the SMA Foundation’s rights, expand Roche’s rights, or reduce Roche’s obligations under the license and collaboration agreement.\nCommercialization.   We have granted Roche worldwide exclusive licenses, with the right to grant sublicenses, to our patent rights and know-how with respect to such compounds and products. Roche is responsible for pursuing worldwide \n\n\n22\n\n\n\nclinical development of compounds from the research program and has the exclusive right to develop and commercialize compounds from the collaboration.\nPayments and Contingent Payments.   Pursuant to the SMA License Agreement, Roche paid us an upfront non-refundable payment of $30.0 million. During the research term, which was terminated effective December 31, 2014, Roche provided us with funding, based on an agreed-upon full-time equivalent rate, for an agreed-upon number of full-time equivalent employees that we contributed to the research program. We are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $135.0 million in payments if specified development and regulatory milestones are achieved and up to an aggregate of $325.0 million in payments if specified sales milestones are achieved. We are also entitled to tiered royalties ranging from 8% to 16% on worldwide net product sales of products developed pursuant to the collaboration. Roche’s obligation to pay us royalties will expire generally on a country-by- country basis at the latest of the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering a product in the given country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for that product in such country or 10 years from the first commercial sale of that product in such country. However, the royalties payable to us may be decreased in certain circumstances. For example, the royalty rate in a particular country is reduced if the product is not protected by patents in that country and no longer entitled to regulatory exclusivity in that country. We remain responsible for making any payments to the SMA Foundation that may become due under our pre-existing sponsored research agreement with the SMA Foundation.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had recognized a total of $310.0 million in milestone payments and $545.6 million royalties on net sales pursuant to the SMA License Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, there are no remaining development and regulatory event milestones that we can receive. The remaining potential sales milestones as of December 31, 2024 are $150.0 million upon achievement of certain sales events.\nIn June 2024, we entered into an amendment with Royalty Pharma Investments 2019 ICAV, or Royalty Pharma, and Royalty Pharma plc, to the A&R Royalty Pharma Purchase Agreement, dated October 18, 2023, or the A&R Royalty Purchase Agreement, which amends and restates in its entirety the Royalty Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 17, 2020, and we exercised our first put option in exchange for $241.8 million in cash consideration. Pursuant to the A&R Royalty Purchase Agreement, we have sold to Royalty Pharma a portion of our right to receive sales-based royalty payments, or the Royalty, on worldwide net sales of Evrysdi and any other product developed pursuant to the SMA License Agreement under the SMA program. To date, Royalty Pharma has paid to us cash consideration of $1.9 billion (less Royalty payments received by us with respect to assigned Royalties, or the Assigned Royalty Rights) in exchange for 90.49% of the Royalty, which will be reduced to 83.33% after Royalty Pharma receives $1.3 billion in aggregate payments, or the Assigned Royalty Cap, from the Royalty assigned under the Original Royalty Purchase Agreement. We currently retain 9.51% of the Royalty, which increases to 16.67% after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met. We have the option to sell our retained portions of the Royalty to Royalty Pharma in up to three tranches for the following payments: (1) $100.0 million in exchange for 3.81% of the Royalty, which increases to 6.67% after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, (2) $100.0 million in exchange for 3.81% of the Royalty, which increases to 6.67% after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, and (3) $50.0 million in exchange for 1.90% of the Royalty, which increases to 3.33% after the Assigned Royalty Cap has been met, in each case less Royalty payments received by us with respect to the Assigned Royalty Rights.\nTermination.   Unless terminated earlier, the SMA License Agreement will expire on the date when no royalty or other payment obligations are or will become due under the agreement. Roche’s termination rights under the license and collaboration agreement include the right to terminate the agreement at any time after November 22, 2013 on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon three months’ notice before the launch of the applicable product or upon nine months’ notice thereafter; and the right to terminate the agreement in specified circumstances following a change of control of us. The license and collaboration agreement provides that we or Roche may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured breach by the other party of a material provision of the agreement, or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon termination of the collaboration agreement by Roche for convenience or termination by us as a result of Roche’s breach, bankruptcy, change of control or patent challenge, we have the right to assume the development and commercialization of product candidates arising from the license and collaboration agreement. In that event, we may become obligated to pay royalties to Roche on sales of any such product.\n\n\n23\n\n\n\nSMA Foundation\nOverview.  In June 2006, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with the SMA Foundation under which we and the SMA Foundation have collaborated in the research and preclinical development of small molecule therapeutics for SMA. As discussed above, we are also collaborating with the SMA Foundation and Roche to further develop these compounds. Pursuant to the sponsored research agreement, as amended, the SMA Foundation provided us with $13.3 million in funding. The SMA Foundation is not obligated to provide any further funding under this agreement.\n\nContinuing financial obligations.  We may become obligated to pay the SMA Foundation single-digit royalties on worldwide net product sales of any collaboration product that we successfully develop and subsequently commercialize or, with respect to collaboration products we outlicense, including Evrysdi, a specified percentage of certain payments we receive from our licensee. As discussed above, we have outlicensed rights to Roche pursuant to a license and collaboration agreement. We are not obligated to make such payments unless and until annual sales of a collaboration product exceed a designated threshold. Since inception, the SMA Foundation has earned $52.5 million in royalty payments, fulfilling our obligation to make such payments, and all of which was paid as of December 31, 2024.\nReversion rights.  In specified circumstances, including those involving our decision to discontinue development or commercialization of a collaboration product, our uncured failure to meet agreed timelines or those that might arise following our change of control, we may be obligated to grant the SMA Foundation exclusive or non-exclusive sublicensable rights under our intellectual property, in certain collaboration products, among other rights, to assume the development and commercialization of such collaboration products and to provide the SMA Foundation with other transitional assistance, which we refer to as a reversion. In some such cases, we may be entitled to receive licensing fee payments from the SMA Foundation and single-digit royalties on sales of the applicable collaboration product, which amounts we collectively refer to as reversion payments. In other cases, the SMA Foundation is not required to make any payments to us in connection with the licenses it receives from us.\nTermination.  Unless terminated earlier, the sponsored research agreement will continue until the earliest of the SMA Foundation’s receipt of the repayment amount or, if there was a reversion, either our receipt of all reversion payments that the SMA Foundation may be obligated to make to us or, if the SMA Foundation is not obligated to make reversion payments, the expiration of the last-to-expire patent we licensed to the SMA Foundation in connection with such reversion. The sponsored research agreement provides that either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency.\nNational Taiwan University\nOverview.  Pursuant to the license and technology transfer agreement, originally entered into between Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc., or Agilis, NTU and Professor Wuh-Liang (Paul) Hwu, in December 2015, or the NTU Licensing Agreement, NTU granted to us an exclusive, perpetual license, with the right to grant sublicenses through all tiers, to research and use the intellectual property, data, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, records, documents, confidential information, materials and know-how pertaining to the Research, including Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency, under the NTU Collaboration Agreement (as defined below), or the Technology, and to develop, make, manufacture, use, sell, import and market the Technology and any other products made, invented, developed or incorporated by or with the Technology, or the Licensed Products. Subject to any regulatory delays or issues, we are obligated to research, use and develop the Technology to manufacture Licensed Products by December 23, 2025. Additionally, we were obligated to obtain marketing approval of Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency, either by the FDA or by the EMA, by December 31, 2024. In July 2022, the EC approved Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency for patients 18 months and older within the EEA, satisfying that obligation. \nFunding Obligations.  NTU received a lump sum of $100,000 upon execution of the NTU Licensing Agreement, as well as $2.0 million milestones payments based on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones, including $1.2 million that became due and payable in July 2022 upon the EC’s approval of Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency. Additionally, NTU will be entitled to receive contingent payments from us based on (i) annual license maintenance fees, (ii) a low double-digit percentage royalty of annual net sales of Licensed Products, and (iii) a percentage \n\n\n24\n\n\n\nof sublicense revenue, ranging from low-twenties to mid-twenties. The annual license maintenance fees are non-refundable, but creditable against annual net sales payments.\nIntellectual Property.  All intellectual property relating to the manufacture, production, assembly, use or sale of Technology and any Licensed Products derived thereof are owned by NTU.\nTermination.  The NTU Licensing Agreement expires on December 23, 2035. Upon expiration, we will have a fully paid-up, perpetual, royalty-free exclusive license to the Technology. We may terminate the NTU Licensing Agreement upon 60 days’ written notice to NTU in the event of (a) the failure of a pivotal clinical study, or serious adverse event in a clinical study, with respect to Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency, that prevents continuing such clinical study under reasonable circumstances or (b) the rejection of a BLA with the FDA or an MAA with the EMA, or equivalent biologics approval application in another territory with respect to Upstaza for the treatment of AADC. In such termination event, we must pay $100,000 to NTU within 30 days of termination and NTU would retain all rights to the Technology. We may terminate the NTU Licensing Agreement for material breach by another party following a 30-day cure period. NTU may terminate the NTU Licensing Agreement for our failure to pay any undisputed license fees or net sales or sublicensing royalty fees within the applicable deadline following a 30-day cure period.\nWe are also a party to collaborative research agreements with NTU, or the NTU Collaboration Agreements, that govern the collaboration between us and NTU with respect to the research and clinical trials for AADC deficiency gene therapy. NTU is responsible for performing the research and clinical trials and we are responsible for providing related funding. As of December 31, 2024, an aggregate amount of $4.5 million in funding payments has been paid to NTU pursuant to the NTU Collaboration Agreements.\nTegsedi and Waylivra\nOverview. PTC Therapeutics International Limited, our subsidiary, entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement, dated August 1, 2018 by and between us and Akcea, for the commercialization by us of Tegsedi, Waylivra and products containing those compounds, which we refer to collectively as the Products, in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, or the PTC Territory. We are responsible for all meetings, communications and other interactions with regulatory authorities in the PTC Territory. The activities of the parties pursuant to the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement is overseen by a Joint Steering Committee, composed of an equal number of representatives appointed by each of us and Akcea.\nCommercialization. Under the terms of the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement, Akcea has granted to us an exclusive right and license, with the right to grant certain sublicenses, under Akcea’s product-specific intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Products in the PTC Territory. In addition, Akcea has granted to us a non-exclusive right and license, with the right to grant certain sublicenses, under Akcea’s core intellectual property and manufacturing intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Products in the PTC Territory and to manufacture the Products worldwide in accordance with a supply agreement with Akcea. Akcea has in-licensed certain of the Akcea intellectual property from its parent company, Ionis. Each party has agreed not to, independently or with any third party, commercialize any competing oligonucleotide product in the PTC Territory for the same gene target as inotersen.\nPayments and Contingent Payments. We paid to Akcea an upfront licensing fee of $18.0 million, consisting of an initial payment of $12.0 million paid in connection with entering into the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement in August 2018, and a second payment of $6.0 million that was paid after Waylivra received regulatory approval from the EMA in May 2019. In addition, Akcea was eligible to receive milestone payments, on a Product-by-Product basis, of $4.0 million upon receipt of regulatory approval for a Product from ANVISA, subject to a maximum aggregate amount of $8.0 million for all such Products. We paid Akcea $4.0 million upon our receipt of marketing authorization from ANVISA in October 2019 for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis in Brazil with Tegsedi and an additional $4.0 million upon our receipt of marketing authorization from ANVISA in August 2021 for the treatment of FCS. Akcea is also entitled to receive royalty payments in the mid-twenty percent range of net sales on a country-by-country and Product-by-Product basis, commencing on the earlier to occur of (1) 12 months after the first commercial sale of such Product in Brazil or (2) the date when we, our affiliates or sublicensees have recognized revenue of $10.0 million \n\n\n25\n\n\n\nor more in cumulative net sales for such Product in the PTC Territory. The royalty payments are subject to reduction in certain circumstances as set forth in the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement.\nTermination. The Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire royalty term with respect to all Products in all countries in the PTC Territory. Either party may terminate the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement on written notice to the other party if such other party is in material breach of its obligations thereunder and has not cured such breach within 30 days after notice in the case of a payment breach or 60 days after notice in the case of any other breach.\nShiratori\nOverview. In connection with our acquisition of Censa Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Censa, in May 2020, we became a party to a license agreement dated as of February 8, 2015, as amended, between Shiratori and Censa, or the Shiratori License Agreement. Pursuant to the Shiratori License Agreement, as amended, Shiratori granted Censa the sole and exclusive worldwide right and license, with the right to sublicense, under certain licensed know-how, or the Licensed Know-How, and licensed patents, or the Licensed Patents, relating to manufacturing processes and technology for sepiapterin, to research, have researched, develop, have developed, use, import, export, market, have marketed, offer for sale, sell and have sold, and otherwise commercialize any final pharmaceutical product in finished form containing sepiapterin as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, including sepiapterin, collectively the Sepiapterin Products, covered by the Licensed Patents or using the Licensed Know-How in all countries and territories of the world.\nPayments and Contingent Payments.

We are also obligated to pay Shiratori certain regulatory and development milestones.\nTermination. Unless earlier terminated, the Shiratori License Agreement will continue in full force and effect on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the obligation to pay royalties with respect to the sale of such Sepiapterin Product in such country expires. The parties may agree to mutually terminate the Shiratori License Agreement. Shiratori may elect to terminate the Shiratori License Agreement upon sixty days’ prior written notice to us in the event that we fail to (i) achieve regulatory approval for a Sepiapterin Product in either the United States or EU by February 8, 2026 or (ii) commercially launch a Sepiapterin Product in the United States or EU by February 8, 2027. We may elect to terminate the Shiratori License Agreement upon sixty days’ prior written notice to Shiratori.\nNovartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation\nOverview. On November 27, 2024 we and Novartis entered into the Novartis Agreement relating to our PTC518 HD program which includes related molecules. Pursuant to the Novartis Agreement, we will continue to conduct the ongoing Phase 2A Clinical Trial and the ongoing OLE Clinical Trial pursuant to its existing development plan, with the goal of transitioning the ongoing OLE Clinical Trial to Novartis within 12 months after the effective date. Novartis will be responsible for all other development of licensed compounds and licensed products and the manufacture and commercialization of licensed compounds and licensed products worldwide.\nPayments and Contingent Payments. Under the Novartis Agreement, and upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the Novartis Agreement in January 2025, we received an upfront payment of $1.0 billion on the effective date and can receive up to $1.9 billion in development, regulatory and sales milestones, a 40% share of U.S. profits and losses, and tiered double-digit royalties on ex-U.S. sales.\nTermination. The Novartis Agreement, unless earlier terminated in accordance therewith, shall continue in force and effect until (a) with respect to the royalty territory, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis, the royalty term end date for such licensed product in such country and (b) with respect to the profit-sharing territory, on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis, until the exploitation of such licensed product has completely terminated. Either party may terminate for material breach of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis may terminate for convenience or for \n\n\n26\n\n\n\nsafety or regulatory issue. We may also terminate (a) solely with respect to such country or other jurisdiction, (b) in the case that such country or other jurisdiction is United States, Brazil, Switzerland, Russia, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, each a Major Market, solely with respect to all Major Markets, or (c) in its entirety, for material breach of diligence obligations.\nOur Ongoing Acquisition-Related Obligations\nFrom time to time, we have engaged in strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product pipeline, including through the acquisition of assets or businesses. In connection with these acquisitions, we have entered into agreements through which we have ongoing obligations, including obligations to make contingent payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and net sales milestones or upon a percentage of net sales of certain products.\nComplete Pharma Holdings, LLC\nOn April 20, 2017, we completed our acquisition of all rights to Emflaza, or the Emflaza Transaction. The Emflaza Transaction was completed pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, dated March 15, 2017, as amended on April 20, 2017, or the Emflaza Asset Purchase Agreement, by and between us and Marathon Pharmaceuticals, LLC (now known as Complete Pharma Holdings, LLC), or Marathon. The assets acquired by us in the Emflaza Transaction include intellectual property rights related to Emflaza, inventories of Emflaza, and certain contractual rights related to Emflaza. We assumed certain liabilities and obligations in the Emflaza Transaction arising out of, or relating to, the assets acquired in the Emflaza Transaction.\nIn addition to the upfront consideration paid to Marathon upon the closing of the Emflaza transaction, Marathon is entitled to receive contingent payments from us based on annual net sales of Emflaza, up to a specified aggregate maximum amount over the expected commercial life of the asset, subject to the terms and conditions of the Emflaza Asset Purchase Agreement. This amount was achieved during the year ended December 31, 2024. Accordingly, no future payments will be due. In 2022, we paid Marathon a single $50.0 million sales-based milestone in accordance with the Emflaza Asset Purchase Agreement.\nAgilis Biotherapeutics, Inc.\nOn August 23, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Agilis pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 19, 2018, or the Agilis Merger Agreement, by and among us, Agility Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned, indirect subsidiary, Agilis and, solely in its capacity as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the equityholders of Agilis, Shareholder Representative Services LLC, or the Merger.\nIn addition to the upfront consideration paid to Agilis equityholders upon the closing of the Merger, Agilis equityholders may become entitled to receive contingent payments from us based on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and net sales milestones, as well as based upon a percentage of net sales of certain products. \nOn April 29, 2020, we, certain of the former equity holders of Agilis, or the Participating Rightholders, and, for the limited purposes set forth in the agreement, Shareholder Representative Services LLC, entered into a Rights Exchange Agreement, or the Rights Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Right Exchange Agreement, we issued 2,821,176 shares of our common stock and paid $36.9 million, in the aggregate, to the Participating Rightholders in exchange for the cancellation and forfeiture by the Participating Rightholders of their rights to receive certain milestone-based contingent payments under the Agilis Merger Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have paid former equity holders of Agilis a total of $72.4 million in connection with the achievement of certain milestone-based contingent payments under the Agilis Merger Agreement. In addition, $11.0 million in regulatory milestones were recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. In May 2023, as part of our strategic portfolio prioritization, we decided to discontinue our preclinical and early research programs for our gene therapy platform, which included programs for FA and Angelman syndrome. As a result, we do not expect the milestones under the Agilis Merger Agreement related to FA and Angelman syndrome to be achieved, and we do not expect to pay royalties on annual net sales related to FA and Angelman syndrome. Our outstanding \n\n\n27\n\n\n\nobligations under the Agilis Merger Agreement related to Upstaza/Kebilidi include obligations to pay up to a maximum aggregate amount of $50.0 million upon the achievement of certain net sales milestones.\nBioElectron Technology Corporation\nOn October 25, 2019, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of BioElectron Technology Corporation, or BioElectron, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement by and between us and BioElectron, dated October 1, 2019, or the BioElectron Asset Purchase Agreement.\nIn addition to the upfront consideration paid to BioElectron upon the closing of the asset acquisition, subject to the terms and conditions of the BioElectron Asset Purchase Agreement, BioElectron may become entitled to receive contingent milestone payments of up to $200.0 million (in cash or in shares of our common stock, as determined by us) from us based on the achievement of certain regulatory and net sales milestones. Subject to the terms and conditions of the BioElectron Asset Purchase Agreement, BioElectron may also become entitled to receive contingent payments based on a percentage of net sales of certain products. Upon the potential achievement in 2025 of certain regulatory milestones relating to vatiquinone, which milestones would be payable in 2026, we expect to make payments to BioElectron of $75.0 million in the aggregate, in cash or shares of our common stock, as determined by us.\nCensa Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nOn May 29, 2020, we acquired Censa pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 5, 2020, or the Censa Merger Agreement, by and among us, Hydro Merger Sub, Inc., our wholly owned, indirect subsidiary, and, solely in its capacity as the representative, agent and attorney-in-fact of the securityholders of Censa, Shareholder Representative Services LLC, or the Censa Merger.\nIn addition to the upfront consideration paid to the Censa securityholders upon the closing of the Censa Merger, pursuant to the Censa Merger Agreement, Censa securityholders will be entitled to receive contingent payments from us based on (i) the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones up to an aggregate maximum amount of $217.5 million for sepiapterin’s two most advanced programs and receipt of a priority review voucher from the FDA as set forth in the Censa Merger Agreement, (ii) $109 million in development and regulatory milestones for each additional indication of sepiapterin, (iii) the achievement of certain net sales milestones up to an aggregate maximum amount of $160.0 million, (iv) a percentage of annual net sales during specified terms, ranging from single to low double digits of the applicable net sales threshold amount, and (v) any sublicense fees paid to us in consideration of any sublicense of Censa’s intellectual property to commercialize sepiapterin, on a country-by-country basis, which contingent payment will equal to a mid-double digit percentage of any such sublicense fees. In February 2023, we completed enrollment of our Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trial for sepiapterin for PKU. In connection with this event and pursuant to the Censa Merger Agreement, we paid a $30.0 million development milestone to the former Censa securityholders. We elected to pay this milestone in the form of shares of our common stock, less certain cash payments. Pursuant to such election, we issued 657,462 shares of our common stock and paid $0.4 million to former Censa securityholders. As of December 31, 2024, we have paid the former Censa securityholders a total of $65.0 million in connection with the achievement of certain regulatory milestone-based contingent payments under the Censa Merger Agreement. We expect to make payments to the former Censa securityholders of $57.5 million in the aggregate in cash upon the potential achievement in 2025 of regulatory milestones relating to sepiapterin pursuant to the Censa Merger Agreement.\nIntellectual Property\nPatents and trade secrets\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain ex-U.S. patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade \n\n\n28\n\n\n\nsecrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.\nAs of January 31, 2025, our patent portfolio included a total of 106 active U.S. patents and 53 pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications, including continuations and divisional applications, that are owned, co-owned, or exclusively in-licensed. Our patent portfolio also includes numerous International and ex-U.S. patents and patent applications. The patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications with claims including composition of matter, pharmaceutical formulation and methods of use of our commercial products including ataluren, the active ingredient in the formulated product Translarna, and risdiplam, the active ingredient in the formulated product Evrysdi.\nThe patent rights relating to ataluren owned by us include 17 issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter, methods of use, formulations, dosing regimens and methods of manufacture and multiple pending U.S. patent applications relating to methods of use, formulation, and dosing regimens. We do not license any material patent rights relating to ataluren to unaffiliated parties. The issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter expired in April 2024 and all U.S. patents that issue from U.S. patent applications arising from the composition of matter also expired in April 2024. Issued U.S. patents relating to therapeutic methods of use are currently scheduled to expire in 2026 and 2027, including patent term adjustment. Our patent rights relating to ataluren include granted patents or pending counterpart patent applications in a number of other jurisdictions, including Canada, certain South American countries, Europe, certain Middle Eastern countries, certain African countries, certain Asian countries and certain Eurasian countries. We own five European patents relating to composition of matter, uses, dosing regimens and methods of manufacture of ataluren, as well as multiple pending European patent applications relating to composition of matter, uses and formulations. Granted European patents expired in April 2024 for those patents drawn to composition of matter, and will expire in 2026 and 2027 for those patents drawn to dosing regimen, and in 2027 for those patents drawn to the manufacturing process. Except as indicated above, the anticipated expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension, patent term adjustment or other marketing exclusivities that may be available to us.\nThe patent rights relating to risdiplam co-owned by us and Roche include seven issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter, methods of use, and methods of manufacture and pending U.S. patent applications. We do not license any material patent rights relating to risdiplam to unaffiliated parties. The issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter are currently scheduled to expire in 2033, 2035 and 2042. Our patent rights include granted patents or pending counterpart patent applications in a number of other jurisdictions, including Canada, certain South American countries, Europe, certain Middle Eastern countries, certain African countries, certain Asian countries and certain Eurasian countries. We co-own four European patents relating to composition of matter, and uses of risdiplam. The expiration dates of the granted European patents relating to composition of matter are currently scheduled to expire in 2033 and 2035. Except as indicated above, these anticipated expiration dates are without regard to potential patent term extension, patent term adjustment or other marketing exclusivities that may be available to us.\nThe patent rights relating to sepiapterin owned by us include five issued U.S. patents relating to composition of matter and methods of use, and one issued U.S. patent, co-owned by us and Shiratori, relating to methods of manufacture, as well as pending U.S. patent applications. We do not license any material patent rights relating to sepiapterin to unaffiliated parties. The last issued U.S. patent relating to composition of matter is currently scheduled to expire in September of 2038. Our patent rights include granted patents or pending counterpart patent applications in a number of other jurisdictions, including Canada, certain South American countries, Europe, certain Middle Eastern countries, certain African countries, certain Asian countries and certain Eurasian countries. We co-own one European patent relating to methods of manufacture of sepiapterin. The European patent relating to composition of matter is currently scheduled to expire in May of 2033. Except as indicated above, these anticipated expiration dates are without regard to potential patent term extension, patent term adjustment or other marketing exclusivities that may be available to us.\nThe patent rights relating to vatiquinone owned by us include seven issued U.S. patents relating to methods of use, formulations, dosing regimens and methods of manufacture and multiple pending U.S. patent applications relating to methods of use, formulation, and dosing regimens. We do not license any material patent rights relating to vatiquinone to unaffiliated parties.  Issued U.S. patents relating to therapeutic methods of use are currently scheduled to expire in between October of 2029 and May of 2032.  Our patent drawn to the manufacturing process in the U.S. will expire in October 2029.  Our patent rights relating to vatiquinone include granted patents or pending counterpart patent applications in a number of other jurisdictions, including Canada, certain South American countries, Europe, certain Middle Eastern \n\n\n29\n\n\n\ncountries, certain African countries, certain Asian countries and certain Eurasian countries. We own four European patents relating to composition of matter, uses, dosing regimens and methods of manufacture of vatiquinone, as well as multiple pending European patent applications relating to composition of matter, uses and formulations. Granted European patents will expire between June of 2026 and July of 2032 for those patents drawn to composition of matter, will expire between June of 2026 and May of 2032 for those patents drawn to dosing regimen, and in October of 2029 for the patent drawn to the manufacturing process. Except as indicated above, the anticipated expiration dates referred to above are without regard to potential patent term extension, patent term adjustment or other marketing exclusivities that may be available to us.\nThe term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved pursuant to a pre-market approval, or PMA, may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. \nAnalogous patent term extension provisions are available in Europe and certain other ex-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. One means of patent term extension in Europe after EMA approval is based on obtaining a Supplementary Protection Certificate, or SPC. We have applied for SPCs for ataluren in all applicable European countries in which we have a European patent and have obtained SPCs or expect to obtain SPCs in all applicable European countries. The maximum patent term extension provided by an SPC is a total of 5 years from the date of patent term expiration. For example, in jurisdictions where an SPC with maximum patent term extension has been granted, the ataluren composition of matter patent would be scheduled to expire in 2029. To the extent a marketing authorization in any particular jurisdiction is not or cannot be maintained, the granted patent may remain in force in that jurisdiction until its natural expiration date, although a granted SPC in that jurisdiction may be withdrawn. To the extent an underlying granted patent may be invalidated in that jurisdiction prior to its natural expiration date, the associated SPC will be invalidated as well. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or other non-European ex-U.S. regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors.\nWe have no patents covering Emflaza or the approved use of Emflaza. See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation” for further information regarding the exclusivity periods we expect to rely on for patients aged 2-5.\nWe rely on orphan drug exclusivity in the EEA for Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency. We rely on the non-patent market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act and the BPCIA to commercialize Kebilidi in the United States. If approved elsewhere, we expect to rely on orphan drug exclusivity in other countries or regions where such exclusivity is available. See “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation” for further information regarding the exclusivity periods that we expect to rely on. \nWe may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and collaborators. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, such agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, former employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by us or licensed to us by others in their work for us, trade secret disputes may arise. If such disputes arise in the U.S., we may protect our trade secrets and pursue remedies available under federal statute using either the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 and/or the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 and, if necessary, under state law using either the Uniform Trade Secrets Act or other State law available in the applicable venue. If such disputes arise ex-US, we may protect our trade secrets and pursue remedies available under local or international law.\n\n\n30\n\n\n\nLicense agreements\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property from third parties. We enter into these agreements to augment our proprietary intellectual property portfolio. The licensed intellectual property covers some of the compounds that we are researching and developing, some post-transcriptional control targets and some of the scientific processes that we use. These licenses impose various diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future.\nWe exclusively in-licensed know-how and materials related to the production and use of Upstaza/Kebilidi. For a further discussion of the material agreements relating to our in-licensing of Upstaza/Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC deficiency, see “Item 1. Business-Our Collaborations, License Agreements and Funding Arrangements-National Taiwan University.” Additionally, we exclusively in-license or jointly own patent applications with claims directed to composition of matter, formulation and methods of use of other gene therapy products candidates currently in development.\nManufacturing\nWe do not currently own or operate functional manufacturing or distribution facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our products or product candidates or compounds that we are testing in our preclinical programs. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of clinical and commercial supplies of our products or product candidates that we may develop, other than small amounts of compounds that we may synthesize ourselves for preclinical testing. We have personnel with manufacturing and quality experience to oversee our contract manufacturers.\nThe active pharmaceutical ingredients in our products and product candidates are provided by third-parties. We currently rely on a single source for the production of some of our raw materials and we obtain our supply of the drug substance for Translarna from two third-party manufacturers. For sepiapterin we rely on two sources for the production of our raw materials and we obtain our supply of the drug substance from two third-party manufacturers. For vatiquinone we rely on one source for the production of our raw materials, and we obtain our supply of the drug substance for vatiquinone from one third-party manufacturer.\nWe engage two separate manufacturers to provide bulk drug product for Translarna. We have a relationship with three manufacturers that are capable of providing primary and secondary packaging services for our finished commercial and clinical Translarna product. We currently engage one manufacturer each to provide bulk drug product for sepiapterin and vatiquinone.\nWe currently obtain our supplies of Translarna, sepiapterin and most of our other products and product candidates from our third-party manufacturers pursuant to agreements that include specific supply timelines and volume expectations. If a manufacturer should become unavailable to us for any reason, we would seek to obtain supply from another manufacturer engaged by us for the applicable product or service. In the event that we were unable to procure the applicable supply from a validated manufacturer, we believe that there are a number of potential replacements for each of our outsourced services, however we likely would experience delays in our ability to supply Translarna, sepiapterin or vatiquinone to patients or in advancing our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers.\nWe obtain our supply of the drug substance for Emflaza through a third-party manufacturer that is currently the only third-party manufacturer qualified to provide Emflaza drug substance for use in the United States. All of our drug product manufacturing, processing and packaging needs for Emflaza tablet and suspension product are fulfilled pursuant to two different exclusive supply agreements assumed by us in connection with our acquisition of Emflaza. We expect to fulfill all of our requirements for Emflaza tablets as well as secondary packaging of Emflaza oral suspension bottles pursuant to one of these agreements, which has an automatic renewal provision subject to the termination rights of each party. We expect to fulfill all of our requirements for Emflaza suspension product pursuant to the other agreement. We are obligated to pay to the manufacturer of the Emflaza suspension product royalty payments, on a quarterly basis, based on a percentage (ranging from low to middle-low double digits) of, or a fixed payment with respect to, our annual net sales of suspension product in the United States, subject to reduction in accordance with the terms of the agreement. \n\n\n31\n\n\n\nIf our drug substance provider or either of our drug product manufacturers was to be unable to provide drug substance or manufacture Emflaza product in sufficient quantities to meet projected demand, future sales could be adversely affected, which in turn could have a detrimental impact on our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the United States and on our ability to commercialize Emflaza, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and results of operations. Further, Emflaza received a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for its approved indications, commencing on the date of FDA approval, under the provisions of the Orphan Drug Act. Emflaza’s seven-year period of orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older expired in February 2024. Emflaza’s orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients two years of age to less than five expires in June 2026. As the holder of orphan exclusivity, we are required to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of Emflaza to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in loss of the drug’s remaining orphan exclusivity in the United States.\nTranslarna, Emflaza and sepiapterin are manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes. Our raw materials are not scarce and are readily available subject to supply chain disruptions. We currently rely on a single source for the production of some raw materials for Translarna and Emflaza, and switching to an alternative source could, in some instances, take time and could lead to delays in manufacturing. We currently rely on multiple sources for the production of raw materials for seipaipterin. We maintain inventories for such materials such that any delays with raw materials will not affect or delay our manufacturing. No material shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2024 and no manufacturing delays are currently expected in 2025. The chemistry is amenable to scale up and does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities or internally, in the case of our gene therapy platform.\nWe have agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of Translarna, sepiapterin and vatiquinone. In the event that we are unable to procure supply from a validated manufacturer, we would seek to identify and qualify replacement suppliers, however this process would likely delay our ability to supply these products to patients or advance our clinical trials. We may be unable to conclude agreements for commercial or clinical supply of these products with third-party manufacturers, or we may be unable to do so on acceptable terms.\nWe currently have contracts with multiple pharmacy and hospital distributors in the EU that distribute Translarna for limited commercial and EAP programs. We have engaged with third-party logistic providers, or 3PLs, which distribute Translarna for the majority of our commercial and EAP programs on our behalf. \nWe utilize third parties for the commercial distribution of Emflaza, including a 3PL to warehouse Emflaza as well as specialty pharmacies to sell and distribute Emflaza to patients. The specialty pharmacies provide us with third-party call center services to provide patient support and financial services, prescription intake and distribution, reimbursement adjudication, and ongoing compliance support.\nPursuant to the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement, we have entered into a master supply agreement with Akcea whereby Akcea or its affiliates will manufacture and supply, or cause to be manufactured and supplied, Tegsedi and Waylivra in quantities sufficient to support the commercialization of Tegsedi and Waylivra in the PTC Territory. This is currently the only manufacturing and supply agreement that we have entered into for the drug substance of Tegsedi and Waylivra. If the master supply agreement is terminated and we are unable to find an alternative third-party contractor, we may encounter delays in manufacturing Tegsedi and Waylivra.\n\nWe have a commercial manufacturing services agreement with MassBiologics of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, or MassBio, to provide sufficient quantities of our Upstaza/Kebilidi materials to meet commercial scale demands. If MassBio is unable to perform its obligations under the commercial manufacturing services agreement, identifying a replacement gene therapy manufacturer would likely be challenging and time-consuming. However, we believe that we have sufficient supply of Upstaza/Kebilidi to meet our near-term commercial needs in such an event. \nIn June 2024, we sold our gene therapy manufacturing business in Hopewell Township, New Jersey. Accordingly, we do not expect to have manufacturing revenue going forward. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized $1.7 million and $7.7 million of manufacturing revenue, respectively, related to plasmid DNA and AAV vector production for external customers. No manufacturing revenue was recognized for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n\n32\n\n\n\nManufacturers and suppliers of product candidates are subject to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements, and other rules and regulations prescribed by ex-U.S. regulatory authorities. We depend on our third-party suppliers and manufacturers for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable ex-U.S. standards.\nCommercial Matters\nSales and marketing team\nOur product revenue has primarily been attributable to sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States and to sales of Emflaza for treatment of DMD in the United States. We have employees across the globe, with the largest concentrations being in the United States, Latin America and Europe.\nIn addition, in select territories, we have engaged full-time consultants, marketing partners and distribution partners to assist us with our international commercialization efforts for our products. We continue to evaluate new territories to determine in which geographies we might, if approved, choose to commercialize our products ourselves and in which geographies we might choose to collaborate with third parties. We expect that our internal team and partnership network will continue to grow, as needed, to maximize access to patients.\nCustomers\nDuring 2024, our product revenue was primarily attributable to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and to Emflaza for treatment of DMD. Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD was available on a commercial basis or via reimbursed EAP programs or similar styled programs in multiple territories outside of the United States. In some territories, orders for Translarna are placed directly with us and in other territories we have engaged with third-party distributors. As a result, orders for Translarna are generally received from hospital and retail pharmacies and, in some cases, one of our third-party partner distributors. Our third-party distributors act as intermediaries between us and end-users and do not typically stock significant quantities of Translarna. The ultimate payor for Translarna is typically a government authority or institution or a third-party health insurer. The payment terms are generally 30 to 90 days after receipt of products.\nEmflaza for treatment of DMD is available on a commercial basis throughout the United States. We utilize five specialty pharmacies to sell and distribute Emflaza to patients. The specialty pharmacies receive prescription orders for Emflaza directly from physicians and ship Emflaza directly to the end-user upon fulfillment of the order. As such, there is very little inventory of Emflaza stocked. The ultimate payor for Emflaza is typically a state health insurance program or a third-party health insurer. The payment terms are generally 30 to 90 days after receipt of products.\nDuring 2024, two of our distributors each accounted for over 10% of our net product sales. Financial information about our net product revenues and other revenues generated in the principal geographic regions in which we operate and our long-lived assets is set forth in our financial statements and in Note 15, “Segment and geographic information” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTranslarna and Emflaza can generally only be returned if agreed upon in writing by us and the product is not opened nor in receipt by the final user, except in the case of quality issues associated with the product. Product is generally shipped when a specific patient is approved by the applicable government or insurer and an individual prescription has been written. The right of return is eliminated as a matter of course when the product is dispensed to patients. Other than in connection with our transition to a new third-party distributor, we have never had a request for a return of a material amount of product for either Translarna or Emflaza.\nIn some countries, orders for named patient sales may be for multiple months of therapy, which can lead to an unevenness in orders which could result in significant fluctuations in quarterly net product sales. For example, almost all of our Brazilian product revenue for Translarna is attributable to centralized group purchase orders through the Brazilian Ministry of Health that are intended to cover multiple months of therapy. Similarly, Translarna orders placed through a distributor for the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation are also intended to cover multiple months of therapy. Any fluctuations in quarterly net product sales in Brazil and Russia resulting from these centralized group purchase orders may also be exacerbated by any delays.\n\n\n33\n\n\n\nTranslarna for the treatment of nmDMD is currently available on a commercial basis in multiple countries outside of the United States. We consider our products to be commercially available when we are permitted to market treatment to patients.\nTranslarna for the treatment of nmDMD is also currently available through EAP or similar styled programs in select countries where funded named patient or cohort programs exist, both within the EEA and in other territories. These programs generally reference the EMA’s determinations with respect to our marketing authorization in the EEA. As of today, Translarna is available under EAP or similar styled programs in various countries outside of the United States. Generally, EAP programs allow for access to Translarna pursuant to a named patient program, under which a physician requests access to Translarna on behalf of the specific, or “named” patient or pursuant to a cohort program, which allows for a broader temporary authorization for use for nmDMD meeting the inclusion criteria. Our EAP programs are named patient or similar styled programs in all territories other than France, which is a cohort program.\nOur ability to make Translarna available via commercial or EAP programs or through similar styled programs is largely dependent upon our ability to maintain our marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged two years and older. The marketing authorization is subject to annual review and renewal by the EC following reassessment by the EMA. In September 2022, we submitted a Type II variation to the EMA to support conversion of the conditional marketing authorization for Translarna to a standard marketing authorization, which included a report on the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041 and data from the open-label extension as further described below. In February 2023, we also submitted an annual marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA. In September 2023, the CHMP gave a negative opinion on the conversion of the conditional marketing authorization to full marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and a negative opinion on the renewal of the existing conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In January 2024, the CHMP issued a negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure. In May 2024, the EC decided not to adopt the CHMP’s negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna and returned such opinion to the CHMP for re-evaluation. In June 2024, following the EC’s request for re-review, the CHMP issued a negative opinion on the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. On October 18, 2024, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following the requested reexamination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the EC has 67 days from the date of issuance to adopt the opinion. At this time, the EC has not yet adopted the negative opinion. If the EC adopts the negative opinion, Translarna would no longer have marketing authorization in the member states of the EEA. The marketing authorization for Translarna remains in effect, pending the EC’s potential adoption of the negative opinion. See “Item 1. Business-Global commercial footprint-Global DMD franchise” and “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Products and our Product Candidates” for further information regarding the marketing authorization in the EEA and related risks.\nMarket Access Considerations\nOur future revenues from our products and any other product candidates we may develop depends largely on our ability to obtain and maintain reimbursement from governments and third-party insurers. Each country in the EEA has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations and many countries in the EEA have other regulations related to the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products in the applicable country. The pricing and reimbursement process varies from country to country and can take a substantial amount of time from initiation to completion. As a result, our commercial launches of products in the EEA has been and is expected to continue to be on a country-by-country basis and we generally will not be able to commence commercial sales of our products pursuant to our marketing authorizations in the EEA in any particular member state of the EEA until we conclude the applicable pricing and reimbursement negotiations and comply with any licensing, employment or related regulatory requirements in that country. The price that is approved by local governmental authorities pursuant to commercial pricing and reimbursement processes may be lower than the price for purchases of product in that country pursuant to a reimbursed early access program.\nIn some instances, reimbursement may be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. For example, in France, EAP programs and commercial sales of a product can begin while pricing and reimbursement rates are under discussion with the applicable government health programs. In the event that the negotiated price of the product is lower than the amount reimbursed for sales made prior to the conclusion of price negotiations, we may become \n\n\n34\n\n\n\nobligated to repay such excess amount to the applicable government health program. Such retroactive reimbursement would be made following the conclusion of price negotiations with the applicable government health authority.\nFor Emflaza, which is approved in the United States, we are engaged in pricing, coverage and reimbursement discussions with third-party payors, such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private commercial insurance plans and pharmacy benefit management plans. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and the amount of reimbursement to be provided for Emflaza are made on a plan-by-plan, and in some cases, on a patient-by-patient basis. Coverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payors, including the processing and adjudication of prescriptions, may vary from weeks to several months. Certain third-party payors routinely impose additional requirements before approving reimbursement of a prescription, including prior authorization and the requirement to try another therapy first. The specialty pharmacies we utilize provide patient services programs to support product access and, when eligible, out-of-pocket assistance.\nWe have generated revenue from net sales of Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA since May 2022. Upstaza is approved for the treatment of AADC deficiency for patients 18 months and older within the EEA and the United Kingdom. In November 2024, the FDA granted accelerated approval for this gene therapy for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States. This gene therapy is marketed with the brand name Kebilidi in the United States. We expect to generate revenue from net sales of Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the United States during the year ending December 31, 2025. Our future revenues from Upstaza/Kebilidi depend largely on our ability to obtain and maintain reimbursement from governments and third-party insurers as described above.\nTegsedi for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis and Waylivra for the treatment of FCS are currently available on a commercial basis in multiple countries outside of the United States and we have the right to commercialize these products in the PTC Territory. We have received marketing authorization from ANVISA for Tegsedi for the treatment of stage 1 or stage 2 polyneuropathy in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis in Brazil and Waylivra for the treatment of FCS and FPL in Brazil. We make commercial sales of Tegsedi for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in Brazil and Waylivra for the treatment of FCS and FPL in Brazil. The marketing authorizations of Tegsedi and Waylivra in Brazil are subject to renewal every five years. We have also made both Tegsedi and Waylivra available in certain countries within the PTC Territory through EAP Programs. Our ability to make Tegsedi and Waylivra available within the PTC Territory is largely dependent upon the maintenance of the marketing authorizations in the EU and the United States by the licensor.\nWe record revenue net of estimated third-party discounts and rebates. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time revenues from product sales are recognized. These allowances are adjusted to reflect known changes in factors and may impact such allowances in the quarter those changes are known.\nFor important information regarding market access and pricing and reimbursement considerations see “Item 1. Business-Government Regulation-Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates” and “-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Products and our Product Candidates”.\nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.\nMany of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or \n\n\n35\n\n\n\nearly-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in some cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. This may have the effect of making branded products less attractive, from a cost perspective, to buyers.\nThe key competitive factors affecting the success of our products and product candidates are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.\nThe competition for our products and product candidates includes the following:\n\n\n\n●   Translarna for nmDMD. There is currently no marketed therapy specifically for nmDMD, other than Translarna in the EEA. Santhera Pharmaceuticals has received approval of Agramee (vamorolone) in the United States for DMD patients ages 2 and up and in the EU and United Kingdom for patients ages 4 years and older. Sarepta Therapeutics has received approval of Elevidys for DMD patients 4 to 5 years of age with a confirmed mutation in the “DMD gene” in the United States and United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Sarepta Therapeutics has also received approval in the United States for two treatments (Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) and Vyondys 53 (golodirsen)) addressing the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene. Additionally, the FDA granted accelerated approval to Viltepso (viltolarsen) from NS Pharma for the treatment of DMD in patients with exon 53 skipping and Sarepta (Casimersen (SRP 4045) for the treatment of DMD in patients with exon 45 skipping. Viltepso (viltolarsen) from NS Pharma is also approved in Japan. Other biopharmaceutical companies are developing treatments addressing the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene, including Dyne Therapeutics (DYNE-251), Wave Life Sciences (WVE-N53), Daiichi Sankyo (DS-5141)), Nippon Shinyaku (Viltolarsen (NS-065/NCNP-01) and NS-089/NCNP-02)), and Astellas (AT-702). Additionally, other pharmaceutical companies are developing micro dystrophin gene therapies for patients with DMD regardless of genotype, including Pfizer (PF-06939926) and Solid Biosciences (SGT-001).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Emflaza for DMD. With the expiration of Emflaza’s orphan exclusivity for treatment of DMD in patients five years and older in February 2024, we face competition from generic versions of Emflaza for this indication. The FDA has not approved a corticosteroid specifically for DMD in the United States other than Emflaza. However, prednisone/prednisolone, which is not approved for DMD in the United States, is generically available and has been prescribed off label for DMD patients. Santhera has received approval of Agramee (vamorolone), in the United States for DMD patients ages 2 and up and in the EU and United Kingdom for patients ages 4 years and older.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Upstaza/Kebilidi. Currently, no other treatment options are available for the underlying cause of AADC deficiency. Additionally, we are not aware of any late-stage development product candidates for AADC deficiency.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Waylivra for FCS. Ionis is developing Olezarsen for the treatment of FCS.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Waylivra for FPL. Waylivra faces competition from Myalept (metreleptin) produced by Cheisi Farmaceutica, Inc., which is currently approved in Brazil for use in generalized lipodystrophy patients. We are not aware of any late-stage development product candidates for FPL.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Tegsedi. Tegsedi faces competition from drugs like Onpattro (patisiran) which was launched by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals in the United States in 2018 and received approval in Brazil for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in 2020 as well as AMVUTTRA (vutrisiran) which Alnylam Pharmaceuticals received approval for in the United States and Brazil in 2022 for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults. Vyndaqel (tafamids meglumine) and Vyndamax (tafamidis) are commercialized in the United States, EU and some countries in Latin America by Pfizer. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of ATTR Amyloidosis with polyneuropathy including BridgeBio Pharma (AG 10), Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA2001), Proclara Biosciences (NPT 189) and SOM Biotech (tolcapone).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Evrysdi. Evrysdi, an orally bioavailable treatment, faces competition from treatments that are not orally bioavailable, including Spinraza (nusinersen), a drug developed by Ionis and marketed by Biogen, which is\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n36\n\n\n\n\napproved to treat SMA and Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec), a gene therapy drug developed by AveXis, Inc., (acquired by Novartis in 2018), which is approved in the United States and Japan for the treatment of SMA in patients under 2 years of age and in Europe for babies and young children who weigh up to 21 kilograms. Novartis is also developing OAV-101, an intrathecal administration of Zolgensma, for SMA patients ages ≥ 2 to &lt; 18 years of age. Biogen is developing a higher dose regimen of nusinersen with potential for improved efficacy and evaluating an implantable medical device to enable subcutaneous delivery of nusinersen. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of SMA, including Scholar Rock (apitegromab, SRK-015), Biohaven (Taldefgrobep alfa), Roche Pharmaceuticals (RO-7204239/GYM-329), Biogen / Ionis (BIIB-115/ION-306) and NMD Pharma (NMD-670).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Sepiapterin for PKU. If approved, sepiapterin could face competition from Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride), including generic versions, and Palynziq (pegvaliase-pqpz), each of which is approved for the treatment of PKU. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of PKU, including Otsuka Pharmaceutical (JNT-517), SOM Biotech (SOM-1311), Maze Therapeutics (MZE-782) and Agios (AG-181).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   PTC518 for HD. There are currently no disease-modifying therapies approved to delay the onset or slow the progression of HD. However, uniQure (AMT-130), Roche and Ionis (tominersen), Skyhawk Therapeutics (SKY 0515), Vico Therapeutics (VO659) and Wave Life Sciences (WVE-003) are all developing product candidates for treatment of Huntington disease.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Vatiquinone for FA. If approved, vatiquinone could face competition from Skyclarys (omaveloxolone) from Biogen, which is approved in the United States and the EU. There are also two assets in early development: LX-2006 (Lexeo/Frataxin AAVrh10) and CTI-1601 (Larimar Therapeutics).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nGovernment Regulation\nGovernment authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, quality control, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, recordkeeping, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and sales and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing and marketing. In addition, sponsors of biopharmaceutical products and drug products participating in Medicaid and Medicare are required to comply with mandatory price reporting, discount, and rebate requirements. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and ex-U.S. statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be subject to civil penalties, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications, supplemental applications, or allow us to manufacture or market our products, we may be criminally prosecuted and we may be debarred or excluded from participation in government healthcare programs. These requirements are continually evolving. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Product and our Product Candidates” for important information regarding some of the risks to our business arising as a result of government regulation.\nU.S. government regulation\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products, including gene therapy products, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and regulations and guidance implementing these laws. The FDCA, PHSA and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving drugs and biologic products. Failure to comply with the applicable FDA requirements at any time pre- or post-approval may result in a delay of approval or administrative or judicial sanctions. \nRegulatory requirements governing our business are also evolving. For example, the FDA has issued a growing body of guidance documents on CMC, clinical investigations and other areas of gene therapy development, all of which are intended to facilitate the industry’s development of gene therapy products. Moreover, the FDA also continually issues guidance documents that provide the FDA’s interpretation of its laws and regulations, as well as the FDA’s approach to scientific issues and questions. While the FDA’s guidance is not binding, it does provide the FDA’s current interpretation and approach.\n\n\n37\n\n\n\nThe new drug and biologic approval process\nIn the United States, an NDA is the vehicle through which the FDA approves a new pharmaceutical drug product for sale and marketing in the United States. A BLA is the vehicle through which the FDA approves a new biologic product for sale and marketing in the United States.\nTo market a new drug or biologic product in the United States, a sponsor generally must undertake the following:\n\n\n●   completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and other applicable laws or regulations;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for clinical testing, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin at United States clinical trial sites;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, and in the case of certain gene therapy studies, an Institutional Biosafety Committee, or IBC, prior to initiation and subject to continuing review;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   completion of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy, in the case of a drug product candidate, or safety purity, and potency, in the case of a biologic product candidate for its intended use, performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, E6 GCP guidelines. Certain gene therapy research must also be conducted in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   development of manufacturing processes to ensure the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   submission and FDA acceptance of an NDA or BLA, and satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee meeting, if applicable;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection or remote regulatory assessment of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs, which require that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection or remote regulatory assessment of selected clinical sites and selected clinical investigators to determine GCP compliance;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use; and\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   compliance with any post approval requirements and commitments, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post approval studies required by the FDA.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nNonclinical Studies and IND Submission\nNonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, pharmacology, stability, toxicity and product formulation, as well as animal or other nonclinical studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. In order to begin clinical testing, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA, which includes, among other things, the results of the nonclinical tests, manufacturing information, analytical data, proposed clinical protocols, and any available clinical data or literature on the product candidate. Some nonclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. The IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.\nClinical Trials\nClinical trials involve the administration of an investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial and subsequent protocol amendments must be filed with the FDA as part of the IND. \n\n\n38\n\n\n\nSponsors will also be required to provide FDA with diversity action plans. In accordance with GCP requirements, all research subjects or their legally authorized representatives must provide their informed consent in writing prior to their participation in a clinical trial. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB and is subject to ongoing IRB monitoring. The IRB must approve the protocol, protocol amendments, the informed consent form, and communications to study subjects before a study commences at the site. An IRB considers among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, and whether the planned human subject protections are adequate. The IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Special clinical trial ethical considerations also must be taken into account if a study involves children. In the case of certain gene therapy studies, an IBC at the local level may also review and maintain oversight over the particular study, in addition to the IRB. If the product candidate is being investigated for multiple intended indications, separate INDs may also be required. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events or other significant safety information is found. Certain reports may also be required to be submitted to the IBC.\nAdditionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of the trial. This group may also review interim data to assess the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. The data safety monitoring board receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may advise the sponsor to halt the clinical trial if it determined there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.\nInformation about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH to be publicly posted on the Clinicaltrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious disease or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access. Investigators must also provide certain information to clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA.\nThe manufacture of investigational drugs and biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and biologics and active ingredients and therapeutic substances imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA. Further, the export of investigational products outside the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.\nIn general, for the purposes of NDA and BLA approval, human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, be divided, or be combined. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in patients or healthy volunteers to evaluate the product’s safety, dosage tolerance, structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, absorption, metabolism distribution, excretion, and pharmacokinetics and, if possible, seek to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve controlled trials in a larger but still relatively small number of subjects from the relevant patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; identify possible short-term adverse effects and safety risks; and provide a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of the drug or biologic product for specific indications. Phase 3 clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to generate enough data to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidate for approval. These trials are well-controlled and are intended to establish the overall risk- benefit profile of the product or product candidate and provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials are usually larger, more time consuming, more complex and more costly than Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. The FDA typically requires that an NDA or BLA include data from two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, but, in certain circumstances, approval may be based upon a single adequate and well-controlled clinical trial plus confirmatory evidence or a single large multicenter trial without confirmatory evidence. In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA on the applicant’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm or refute the effectiveness of a product candidate, and can provide important safety information.\nAdditional kinds of data may also help support a BLA or NDA, such as patient experience data and real world evidence. Real world evidence may also be used to assist in clinical trial design or support an NDA for already approved products. \n\n\n39\n\n\n\nFor genetically targeted populations and variant protein targeted products intended to address an unmet medical need in one or more patient subgroups with a serious or life-threatening rare disease or condition, the FDA may allow a sponsor to rely upon data and information previously developed by the sponsor or for which the sponsor has a right of reference, that was submitted previously to support an approved application for a product that incorporates or utilizes the same or similar genetically targeted technology or a product that is the same or utilizes the same variant protein targeted drug as the product that is the subject of the application. A program has also been established whereby a platform technology that is incorporated within or utilized by an approved drug or biologic product may be designated as a platform technology, provided that certain conditions are met, which are outlined in an FDA guidance, in which case development and approval of subsequent products using such technology may be expedited.\nConcurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional nonclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug or biologic product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and adequate stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nAdditional FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs\nThe FDA has various programs that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of certain products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs or present a significant improvement over existing therapy. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new therapeutics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. \nTo be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product candidate is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. If Fast Track designation is obtained, sponsors may be eligible for more frequent development meetings and correspondence with the FDA. In addition, the FDA may potentially initiate a rolling review of sections of an application before the application is complete. This ‘‘rolling review’’ is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the remaining information. Applicable user fees must also be paid before the FDA will commence its review. In some cases, a Fast Track product may be eligible for accelerated approval or priority review.\nThe FDA may give a priority review designation to product candidates that are intended to treat serious conditions and, if approved, would provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of the serious condition. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA is to review an application within six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines.\nThe FDA’s accelerated approval process allows for potentially faster development and approval of certain drugs or biologic products intended to treat serious or life-threatening illnesses that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments. Under the accelerated approval process, the adequate and well-controlled clinical trials conducted with the drug or biologic product establish that the drug or biologic product has an effect on a “surrogate” endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs or biologic products approved through the accelerated approval process are subject to certain post-approval requirements, including completion of Phase 4 clinical trials to demonstrate clinical benefit. By the date of approval of an accelerated approval product, FDA must specify the conditions for the required post approval studies, including enrollment targets, the study protocol, milestones, and target completion dates. The FDA may also, and frequently does, require that the confirmatory Phase 4 studies be commenced prior to the FDA granting a product accelerated approval. Reports on the progress of the required Phase 4 confirmatory studies must be submitted to the FDA every 180 days after approval. If the trials fail to verify the clinical benefit of the drug or biologics product, the FDA may withdraw approval of the application through a statutorily defined streamlined process. Failure to conduct the required Phase 4 confirmatory studies or to conduct such studies with due diligence, as well as failure to submit the required update reports can subject a sponsor to \n\n\n40\n\n\n\npenalties. Promotional materials for a drug or biologic approved under the accelerated approval pathway are subject to the FDA prior review.\nSponsors can also request designation of a product candidate as a ‘‘breakthrough therapy.’’ A breakthrough therapy is defined as a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are eligible for intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1 trials, a commitment from the FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative and cross-disciplinary review, rolling review, and the facilitation of cross-disciplinary review.\nAnother expedited pathway is the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designation. Qualifying products must be a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or a combination of such products, and not a product solely regulated as a human cell and tissue product. The product must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that the product has the potential to address an unmet need for such disease or condition. Advantages of the RMAT designation include all the benefits of the Fast Track and breakthrough therapy designation programs, including early interactions with the FDA. These early interactions may be used to discuss potential surrogate or intermediate endpoints to support accelerated approval.\nCompanion Diagnostics and Other Combination Products\nA drug or biologic product may be regulated as combination product if it is intended for use in conjunction with a medical device, such as a drug delivery device or in vitro diagnostic device, as further discussed below. In such cases, the use of the two products together (i.e., the drug/biological product and the device) must be shown to be safe and effective for the proposed intended use and the labeling of the two products must reflect their combined use. In some cases, the device component may require a separate premarket submission; for example, when the device component is intended for use with multiple drug products. Sponsors of clinical studies using investigational devices are required to comply with FDA’s investigational device exemption regulations. Once approved or cleared, the sponsor of the device component submission (or the combination product submission, if both components are covered by one premarket submission) would need to comply with FDA’s post-market device requirements, including establishment registration, device listing, device labeling, unique device identifier, quality system regulation, medical device reporting, and reporting of corrections and removals requirements.\nIf the safety or effectiveness of a drug or biologic product candidate for its proposed indication is dependent on the measurement or detection of specified biomarkers, the FDA may require the contemporaneous approval or clearance of an in vitro companion diagnostic device that measures such biomarkers, and require the labeling of both the drug/biological product and the companion diagnostic to including instructions for use of the two products together. The FDA has explained in guidance that in vitro companion diagnostic devices may be used for a number of purposes, including identifying appropriate subpopulations for treatment. The type of premarket submission required for a companion diagnostic device will depend on the FDA classification of the device. A premarket approval, or PMA, application is required for high risk devices classified as Class III; a 510(k) premarket notification is required for moderate risk devices classified as Class II; and a de novo request may be used for novel devices not previously classified by FDA that are low or moderate risk. It is also possible that an in vitro companion diagnostic device could be subject to the FDA enforcement discretion from compliance with the FDCA if it meets the definition of a Laboratory Developed Test, or LDT. However, the FDA issued a final rule in April 2024 to end enforcement discretion for LDTs and actively regulate such products as medical devices. Under this final rule, LDTs are required to come into compliance with the FDA’s medical device regulatory requirements in a staged approach over the course of four years. The implementation of this LDT final rule could potentially be affected by the Executive Order, Regulatory Freeze Pending Review, issued on January 20, 2025 and/or the anticipated change in leadership at the FDA under the new administration.\nThe FDA’s guidance states that the FDA generally will not approve a drug or biologic that is dependent upon the use of a companion diagnostic device if no such device is contemporaneously FDA-approved or -cleared for the relevant indication. \n\n\n41\n\n\n\nAccording to the guidance, however, the FDA may approve such a drug/biologic product without an approved/cleared companion diagnostic when the drug/ biologic “is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition for which no satisfactory alternative treatment exists” and the FDA determines that the benefits from the use of the drug/biologic “are so pronounced as to outweigh the risks from the lack of an” approved/cleared companion diagnostic. Under these circumstances, the FDA expects that a companion diagnostic would be subsequently approved/cleared, and that the drug/biologic labeling would be revised “to stipulate the use of the” companion diagnostic device. The FDA would also consider whether additional protections, such as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, or post-approval requirements, are necessary.\nIn a separate guidance, specific to DMD and related dystrophinopathies, the FDA has stated that a sponsor should contemporaneously develop a companion diagnostic device in situations where (1) the safety or efficacy of the drug or biologic product “may be related to the patient’s specific dystrophin mutation or to another type of finding related to a biomarker,” and (2) a suitable companion diagnostic device is not currently available. However, given “the serious and life-threatening nature of dystrophinopathies and the lack of satisfactory alternative treatments that currently exist,” the guidance further states that the FDA may approve a drug/biologic “even if a companion diagnostic device is not yet approved or cleared, if the benefits are so pronounced as to outweigh the risks from the lack of an approved or cleared in vitro companion diagnostic device.” During the review, the “FDA will determine the need for clearance or approval of the device.” The FDA guidance documents represent the FDA’s current thinking on a topic but do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\nFDA Approval Process\nAssuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including proposed labeling and information on the chemistry, manufacture and composition of the product, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee, though a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Product candidates that are designated as orphan products are not subject to application user fees unless the application includes an indication other than the orphan indication. The user fees must be paid at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.\nIf the FDA determines that the NDA or BLA is incomplete, the FDA may refuse to file the application. If the FDA refuses to file an NDA or BLA, the applicant may refile the application with information addressing the FDA identified deficiencies, which refiling would be subject to FDA review before it is accepted for filing. After the NDA or BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product meets FDA’s approval standard and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA, the FDA has set the review goal of completing its review of 90% of all standard applications for new molecular entities and original BLAs within ten months of the 60 day filing date. Under the FDA’s priority review program, however, the FDA set a review goal of completing its review of 90% of all applications within 6 months of the 60 day filing date. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by additional three-month review periods whenever the FDA requests or the NDA or BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review cycle. \nNDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs for a new active ingredient, dosage form, dosage regimen, or route of administration, unless subject to the below requirement for molecularly targeted cancer products, must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. This requirement does not generally apply to products for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. \n\n\n42\n\n\n\nHowever, compliance may be required if approval is sought for other indications for which the product has not received orphan designation.\nProduct candidates intended for the treatment of adult cancer which are directed at molecular targets that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of pediatric cancer, must submit, with the marketing application, reports from molecularly targeted pediatric cancer investigations designed to yield clinically meaningful pediatric study data, gathered using appropriate formulations for each applicable age group, to inform potential pediatric labeling. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals or waivers of some or all of this data, as above. Orphan products are not exempt from this requirement.\nThe FDA will typically inspect or conduct an inspection or remote regulatory assessment of one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP before approving an NDA or BLA. The FDA also will inspect or conduct a remote regulatory assessment of the facility or the facilities at which the product is manufactured before the NDA or BLA is approved. The FDA will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory.\nThe FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or biologic products to an advisory committee for recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Specifically, for a product candidate for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that product candidate to an advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the product candidate to an advisory committee. The FDA may also refer other product candidates to an advisory committee if FDA believes that the advisory committee’s expertise would be beneficial. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully, particularly any negative recommendations or limitations, when making drug or biologic product approval decisions.\nAfter evaluating the marketing application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection or remote regulatory assessment reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval and describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the marketing application, and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes; or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either: resubmit the marketing application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter; withdraw the application; or request an opportunity for a hearing. The FDA has the goal of reviewing 90% of application resubmissions in either two or six months of the resubmission date, depending on the kind of resubmission. Even with submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.\nAdditional regulation for gene therapy clinical trials\nIn addition to the regulations discussed above, there are a number of additional standards that apply to clinical trials involving the use of gene therapy. The FDA has issued, and continues to issue, various guidance documents regarding the development and commercialization of gene therapies, which outline additional factors that the FDA will consider at each of the above stages of development and relate to, among other things: the proper preclinical and nonclinical assessment of gene therapies; the design and conduct of clinical trials, the CMC information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an IND or BLA application; and long term patient and clinical study subject follow up and regulatory reporting. The FDA also issued guidance documents that address guidance specific to the development of gene therapy products for neurodegenerative diseases and with respect to the use of human and animal derived materials.\n​\n\n\n43\n\n\n\nPost-approval requirements\nAfter FDA approval of a product is obtained, we are required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements, including, among other things, establishment registration and product listing, record-keeping requirements, reporting certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, providing updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling. As a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA, the FDA may require the applicant to conduct additional clinical trials or other post market testing and surveillance to further monitor and assess the product’s safety and efficacy. There also are continuing annual program user fee requirements for approved products, though orphan products may receive exemptions if certain criteria are met.\nThe FDA also has the authority to require a specific REMS to ensure that a product’s benefits outweigh its risks. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the product’s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the product, or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on an approved product if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks.\nThe FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians may prescribe a drug or biologic for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote the product for the approved indications and in accordance with the approved labeling. All statements regarding products must be consistent with the FDA approved label, must be truthful and non-misleading, and must be adequately substantiated with a fair balance between product benefit claims and risks, among other requirements. This means, for example, that a manufacturer cannot make claims about the use of its marketed products or their relative benefits compared to other treatments outside of their FDA approved indications and label and without adequate comparative studies, and it would not be able to discuss or provide information on off-label uses or off-label safety benefits of such products in a promotional context. Over the last few years, the FDA has taken a number of actions in the advertising and promotional spaces, including issuing a final rule and a guidance on risk and efficacy disclosures in direct to consumer advertising, and a guidance on communication of off-label scientific information about approved products. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing advertising and promotion can have negative consequences, including FDA and other governmental authority enforcement actions.\nIn addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, in addition to state requirements. Reports must also be submitted to the FDA on sample distribution. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, added sections in the FDCA that require manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, and third-party logistics providers to take steps to identify and trace certain prescription drugs and biologics to protect against the threats of counterfeit, diverted, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful products in the supply chain. The DSCSA regulates the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical drugs and biologics, requiring passage of documentation to track and trace each prescription product at the saleable unit level through the distribution system. This documentation must be transferred electronically. The FDA is also phasing in requirements with respect to the interoperable exchange of electronic product tracing at the package level. Products subject to the DSCSA must only be transferred to appropriately licensed purchasers. The DSCSA also requires manufacturers and repackagers to affix or imprint a unique product identifier on product packages in both a human-readable and on a machine-readable data carrier. The DSCSA also establishes several requirements relating to the verification of product identifiers. Further, under this legislation, sponsors have product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. \nAlso, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. The FDA has issued a guidance specifically on demonstrating product comparability, and the management and reporting of manufacturing changes for investigational and licensed cellular and gene therapy products. FDA regulations also require investigation \n\n\n44\n\n\n\nand correction of any deviations from cGMP and specifications, and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use.\nManufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and provide information regarding the products that they manufacture. The information that must be submitted to the FDA regarding manufactured products was expanded through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES, Act to include the volume of drugs produced during the prior year.\nEstablishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections or remote regulatory assessments by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. The FDA may take into account results of inspections performed by certain counterpart ex-U.S. regulatory agencies in assessing compliance cGMPs. The FDA has entered into international agreements with ex-U.S. agencies, including in the EU, in order to facilitate this type of information sharing.\nSponsors are further subject to various requirements related to FDA drug shortage and manufacturing volume reporting, supply chain security, such as risk management plan requirements, and the promotion of supply chain redundancy. Legislation and executive actions have also been issued to encourage domestic manufacturing.\nAdditional controls for biologics\nTo help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.\nAfter a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.\nOther regulatory agencies may also regulate our use of biological materials, which may necessitate that we, our manufacturers, or other third parties with whom we work obtain permits and otherwise comply with regulatory requirements.\nOrphan drug designation.\nWe have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, Emflaza for the treatment of DMD, Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC deficiency, Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA, vatiquinone for the treatment of FA, sepiapterin for the treatment of hyperphenylalaninemia, including hyperphenylalaninemia caused by PKU, and PTC518 for the treatment of HD. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs and biologics intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which is defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that product. Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain orphan designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that that is considered by the FDA to be the same as the already approved product and is intended for the same indication. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application \n\n\n45\n\n\n\nfor marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan drug designation can provide opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and FDA user-fee benefits.\nThe FDA’s regulations provide flexibility in meeting approval standards for new therapies intended to treat persons with life-threatening and severely-debilitating illnesses, especially where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists, such that the FDA may exercise scientific judgment in determining the kind and quantity of data required for approval and during development programs. Per guidance issued by the FDA with respect to rare diseases, “[t]his flexibility extends from the early stages of development to the design of adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations required to demonstrate effectiveness to support marketing approval and to establish safety data needed for the intended use.” The FDA states that it “is committed to helping sponsors create successful drug development programs that address the particular challenges posed by each disease….”\nIf a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or the same drug or biologic for different indications. However, competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity. \nNotably, the exact scope of orphan drug exclusivity may be an evolving space. A 2021 judicial decision, Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, challenged and reversed an FDA decision on the scope of orphan product exclusivity for the drug, Firdapse. Under this decision, orphan drug exclusivity for Firdapse blocked approval of another company’s application for the same drug for the entire disease or condition for which orphan drug designation was granted, not just the disease or condition for which approval was received. In a January 2023 Federal Register notice, however, the FDA stated that it intends to continue to apply its regulations tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved. The exact scope of orphan drug exclusivity will likely be an evolving area. \nOrphan product sameness decisions are also an evolving space. The FDA issued a final guidance document on how the agency will determine the “sameness” of gene therapy products. Pursuant to the guidance, “sameness” will depend on the products’ transgene expression, viral vectors groups and variants, and other product features that may have a therapeutic effect. Generally, minor differences between gene therapy products will not result in a finding that two products are different. Any FDA sameness determinations could impact our ability to receive approval for our product candidates and to obtain or retain orphan drug exclusivity.\nRare Pediatric Disease Voucher Program\nUnder the FDCA, the FDA awards priority review vouchers to sponsors of rare pediatric disease products that meet certain criteria. To qualify, the rare disease must be serious or life-threatening in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years. Also, the product must contain no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) that has been previously approved in any other application and the application must meet certain additional qualifying criteria, including eligibility for FDA priority review. If FDA determines that a product is for a rare pediatric disease and the qualifying application criteria are met, upon a sponsor’s request, the FDA may award the sponsor a priority review voucher. This voucher may be redeemed to receive priority review (i.e., a review time of 6 months as compared to 10 months for standard review) of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. Use of a priority review voucher is subject to an FDA user fee. These vouchers are transferable. Accordingly, sponsors may sell these vouchers for substantial sums of money. Vouchers may also be revoked by the FDA under certain circumstances and sponsors of approved rare pediatric disease products must submit certain reports to the FDA.\nThe FDA’s ability to issue pediatric priority review vouchers may, however, be limited, as the program lapsed in December 2024 and has not yet been reauthorized by Congress. Under the law’s sunset provision, the drug or biologic was required to be designated by the FDA for a rare pediatric disease no later than December 20, 2024, and approved no later than September 30, 2026. While, as of December 2024, the FDA continued to grant rare pediatric disease designations, unless \n\n\n46\n\n\n\nthere is further Congressional action, the FDA will not be able to award priority review vouchers to products that received a designation after December 20, 2024. We may not be able to obtain rare pediatric disease designation for products in the future and may also not be able to qualify for priority review vouchers.\nHatch-Waxman Act for Drugs.\nSection 505 of the FDCA describes three types of drug marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained the right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that generally has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product, called the reference listed drug. Certain differences, however, between the reference listed drug and ANDA product may be permitted pursuant to a suitability petition. Certain labeling differences may also be permitted if information in the reference listed drug’s label is protected by patent or exclusivities. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they are generally not required to include nonclinical and clinical data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applications must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients to the site of action in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. In an effort to clarify which patents must be listed in the Orange Book, in January 2021, Congress passed the Orange Book Transparency Act of 2020, which largely codifies FDA’s existing practices into the FDCA. Listing patents in the Orange Book that do not qualify for listing can be considered to be anticompetitive conduct and, in 2023, the Federal Trade Commission sent letters to a number of companies with respect to certain patents that the agency asserted were improperly listed or inaccurate and improper listings have been the subject of recent court cases.\nUpon submission of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacturer, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA approval cannot be made effective until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification.\nIf the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the certification to the NDA and patent holders. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification, in which case the FDA may not make an approval effective until the earlier of 30 months from the patent or application owner’s receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent is favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30 month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30 month stay. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor’s decision to initiate patent litigation.\n\n\n47\n\n\n\nExclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA generally may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the new chemical entity. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.\nThe FDCA also provides a shorter three-year period of exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Three-year exclusivity may be granted for example, for new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.\nBPCIA Exclusivity\nThe 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act included the BPCIA as a subtitle. The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. The FDA has issued a number of guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars, including guidance documents on the demonstration of interchangeability and the licensure of biosimilar and interchangeable products for fewer than all of the reference product’s licensed conditions of use.\nUnder the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there is a high degree of similarity to the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the FDA. There must be no difference between the reference product and a biosimilar in mechanism of action, conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the FDA must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.\nUnder the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. However, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the 12 year exclusivity period. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own nonclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products.\nThe BPCIA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings \n\n\n48\n\n\n\nagainst the biosimilar product sponsor. The biosimilar applicant may also be able to bring an action for declaratory judgment concerning the patent.\nThe FDA maintains a publicly available online database of licensed biological products, which is commonly referred to as the “Purple Book.” The Purple Book lists product names, dates of licensure, and applicable periods of exclusivity. Further, the reference product sponsor must provide patent information and patent expiry dates to the FDA following the exchange of patent information between biosimilar and reference product sponsors. This information is then published in the Purple Book.\nIn an effort to increase competition in the drug and biologic product marketplace, Congress, the executive branch, and the FDA have taken certain legislative and regulatory steps. For example, measures have been proposed and implemented to facilitate product importation. Moreover, the 2020 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act included provisions requiring that sponsors of approved drug and biologic products, including those subject to REMS, provide samples of the approved products to persons developing 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA drug products, or biosimilar products within specified timeframes, in sufficient quantities, and on commercially reasonable market-based terms. Failure to do so can subject the approved product sponsor to civil actions, penalties, and responsibility for attorney’s fees and costs of the civil action. This same bill also includes provisions with respect to shared and separate REMS programs for reference and generic drug products.\nPatent Term Restoration\nIf approved, drug and biologic products may also be eligible for periods of U.S. patent term restoration if an application is timely filed with the Patent and Trademark Office. If granted, patent term restoration extends the patent life of a single unexpired patent, that has not previously been extended, for a maximum of five years, and only those claims reading on the approved drug may be extended. The total patent life of the product with the extension also cannot exceed fourteen years from the product’s approval date. Subject to the prior limitations, the period of the extension is calculated by adding half of the time from the effective date of an IND to the initial submission of a complete marketing application, and all the time between the submission of the marketing application and its approval. This period may also be reduced by any time that the applicant did not act with due diligence.\nPediatric exclusivity\nPediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent market exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of market protection to the term of any existing Orange Book- listed patents or regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study or studies within a specified timeframe prior to the expiration of the underlying patent or market exclusivity period to be extended.\nRegulation outside the United States\nIn order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of ex-U.S. countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. And, even if regulatory approval is granted, it may be withdrawn or limited under certain circumstances or post-approval requirements may be imposed by the applicable regulatory authority. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.\n\n\n49\n\n\n\nRegulation in the European Union\nWe have obtained an orphan medicinal product designation from the EC, following an evaluation by the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency, Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA, vatiquinone for the treatment of FA, sepiapterin for the treatment of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia, including hyperphenylalaninemia caused by PKU and PTC518 for the treatment of HD. The EC can grant orphan medicinal product designation to products for which the sponsor can establish that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would generate a sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. In addition, the sponsor must establish that there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan drug designation is not a marketing authorization. It is a designation that provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance, and, in the event of a successful application for a centralized EU marketing authorization, 10 years of EU market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA, nor the EC nor any EU member states can accept an application or grant a marketing authorization for a “similar medicinal product.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In addition, a competing similar medicinal product may in limited circumstances be authorized prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period, including if it is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to our product. Our product candidates can lose orphan designation, and the related benefits, prior to us obtaining a marketing authorization if it is demonstrated that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met.\nThe EC has conducted a review of the Orphan Drug Regulation together with the Paediatric Regulation. The outcome of this review is intended to guide future legislative changes and shape the EU’s pharmaceutical strategy.\nClinical Trial Developments.  The structure and general regulation of clinical trials for both small molecule and biological medicines in the EU is similar to that in the United States. Separately, a new regulation, (EU) No.536/2014, regarding clinical trials of medicinal products for humans is included in the European regulatory framework and fills a series of regulatory gaps in the clinical trials regime through the creation of a uniform framework for the authorization of clinical trials by all interested EU member states with a single assessment of the results. The regulation (which came into effect on January 31, 2022) is thus intended to facilitate cross-border cooperation through streamlining of the rules on clinical trials across the EU, including by requiring the submission of clinical trial authorization applications via a new electronic EU portal.\nAlongside the portal, a database has been created containing information on clinical trial data. The information on the database is publicly accessible unless the trial data’s confidentiality can be justified on the basis of protection of commercially confidential information, protection of personal data, protection of confidential communication between EU countries, or ensuring effective supervision of the conduct of clinical trials by EU countries. A sponsor of a trial conducted in the EU under the new regulation is required to submit a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU database within a year of the end of the trial. In addition, where the trial was intended to be used for obtaining a marketing authorization (whether through the centralized procedure or via the national authorities), the applicant must submit the clinical study report within 30 days after the marketing authorization has been granted (or refused or withdrawn).\nOverview of application process.  To obtain regulatory approval of a drug under the EU’s regulatory systems and authorization procedures, an applicant may submit marketing authorization applications under a centralized, decentralized, or national procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, like Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, and medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, and optional for certain other innovative products. The centralized procedure enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states based on a single application. Under the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, is required to adopt an opinion on a valid \n\n\n50\n\n\n\napplication within 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions. \nMore specifically, on day 120 of the procedure, once the CHMP has received the preliminary assessment reports and opinions from the rapporteur and co-rapporteur, it prepares a list of potential outstanding issues, referred to as “other concerns” or “major objections”. These are sent to the applicant together with CHMP’s recommendation. In addition, in relation to advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, which are medicines based on genes, cells or tissues, the Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, EMA’s committee responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of ATMPs, prepares a draft opinion on the ATMP application that is submitted to EMA before the CHMP adopts a final opinion on the marketing authorization of the applicable medicine. The CHMP can make one of two recommendations: (1) the marketing authorization could be granted provided that satisfactory answers are given to the “other concerns” and/or “major objections” identified and that all conditions outlined in the list of outstanding issues are implemented and complied with; or (2) the product is not approvable since there are “major objections”.\nApplicants have three months from the date of receiving the potential outstanding issues to respond to the CHMP, and can request a three-month extension if necessary. The granting of a marketing authorization will depend on the recommendations and potential major objections identified by the CHMP as well as the ability of the applicant to adequately respond to these findings. An accelerated assessment can be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision on the marketing authorization application must be adopted by the EC, after consulting the EU member states, which in total can take more than 60 days.\nAn applicant for a marketing authorization application may request a re-examination in the event of a negative opinion, in connection with which CHMP appoints new rapporteurs. Within 60 days of receipt of the negative opinion, the applicant must submit a document explaining the basis for its request for re-examination. The CHMP has 60 days to consider the applicant’s request for re-examination. The applicant may request an oral explanation before the CHMP, which is routinely granted, following which CHMP will adopt a final opinion. The final opinion, whether positive or negative, is published by the CHMP shortly following the CHMP meeting at which the oral explanation takes place. The EMA publishes a European Public Assessment Report, or EPAR, for every medicine granted a central marketing authorization by the EC following an assessment by the CHMP. EPARs are full scientific assessment reports of medicines authorized by the EMA.\nConditional marketing authorizations.  In specific circumstances, as with Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, EU legislation enables applicants to obtain a marketing authorization on a conditional basis prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for products designated as orphan medicinal products, if (1) the benefit-risk balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs, and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the benefit-risk balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions and/or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization. The granting of a conditional marketing authorization will depend on the applicant’s ability to fulfill the conditions imposed within the agreed upon deadline.\nFor important information about matters that may adversely affect our ability to renew our conditional marketing authorization for Translarna, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates.”\nVariations to conditional marketing authorizations.  After the granting of a conditional marketing authorization, the marketing authorization holder may submit an application to vary the conditional marketing authorization under a variation \n\n\n51\n\n\n\nprocedure. In the case of the introduction of an additional therapeutic indication, the timeframe for the variation procedure for the initial assessment of the dossier is generally 90 days (plus up to 20 days for validation).\nHowever, in the framework of a variation application assessment procedure, the EMA may send one or more requests for supplementary information to the marketing authorization holder, requiring that additional information be provided by the marketing authorization holder to support its variation application. Such supplementary requests will be sent together with a timetable stating the date by when the marketing authorization holder must submit the requested data and, where appropriate, the extended evaluation period to be applied to such variation procedure. The 90-day variation procedure may be suspended for up to three months for the marketing authorization holder to submit its responses to such supplementary requests. The marketing authorization holder will be notified of the outcome of the CHMP’s assessment of the variation procedure within 15 days from the adoption of the CHMP opinion. If unfavorable, the CHMP opinion may be subject to a re-examination procedure upon the marketing authorization holder’s request. This may imply an additional minimum two-month procedure. If the CHMP opinion is favorable, the EC will usually vary the marketing authorization to introduce the additional therapeutic indication within approximately two months from the receipt of the final CHMP opinion.\nExceptional Circumstances.  Similarly, certain of our product candidates may be eligible for a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances. Such an authorization may be granted where the applicant can demonstrate in its application that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use, because: 1) the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence; 2) in the present state of scientific knowledge, comprehensive information cannot be provided; or 3) it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information. Authorizations under exceptional circumstances are annually reassessed and granted subject to a requirement for the applicant to implement certain procedures, in particular, competent authority notification in the event of any safety issue. After 5 years, the authorization is renewed under exceptional circumstances for an unlimited period, unless the EMA decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. A marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances will not be granted when a conditional marketing authorization is more appropriate. Orphan products are further eligible for approval under exceptional circumstances only if the criteria considered for the approval under exceptional circumstances are fulfilled.\nAdditional requirements and considerations.  Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver, or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. In the case of orphan medicinal products, completion of an approved PIP can result in an extension of the aforementioned market exclusivity period from ten to twelve years.\nIn the EU there is also a procedure which allows member states to authorize the distribution of an unauthorized medicinal product in response to the spread of pathogens. The UK (but no EU countries) used this procedure with two COVID-19 vaccines during December 2020. Notwithstanding the UK’s subsequent full departure from the EU, the EU provision is mirrored in UK medicines legislation.\nIn the EU, for a period of eight years from the grant of a marketing authorization of an innovative product (the “reference medicinal product”), competent authorities may not accept marketing authorization applications from applicants seeking to market “generic medicinal products” where such applications rely on the data in the marketing authorization dossier of the reference product. Moreover, generic medicinal products that rely on the independently generated data of the reference product may not be placed on the market for 10 years from the granting of the initial marketing authorization for that reference medicinal product. This is extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications considered to offer a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. These periods of data exclusivity do not prevent other companies from obtaining a marketing authorization based on their own independently generated data. The data exclusivity regime is currently under review. The EC intends to strike a balance between providing incentives for innovation and supporting timely patient access to medicinal products across the EU. To do so, the EC has published a proposal for a revised Directive on the Union Code Relating to Medicinal Products for Human Use, which proposes replacing the regulatory data protection system with a new regime that will offer innovators variable durations of data exclusivity. Under the new rules, if implemented, new medicinal products will have a minimum period of regulatory protection of \n\n\n52\n\n\n\neight years, which includes six years of regulatory data protection and two years of market protection. Such products may benefit from additional periods of regulatory data protection if they satisfy certain criteria, which may increase the total period of regulatory protection up to a maximum of 12 years (as compared to the current maximum of 11 years).\nIf a marketing authorization is granted in the EEA for a medicinal product, such as the marketing authorization granted for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD by the EC, the marketing authorization holder is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal products that are in addition to the other conditions of the marketing authorization described above. The marketing authorization holder must, for example, comply with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post- authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. Other requirements relate to, for example, the manufacturing of products and active pharmaceutical ingredients in accordance with good manufacturing practice standards. Competent authorities of EU member states may conduct inspections to verify compliance with applicable requirements, and the marketing authorization holder will have to continue to expend time, money and effort to remain compliant. Non-compliance with EU requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties in the EU Similarly, failure to comply with the EU’s requirements regarding the protection of individual personal data can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. Individual EU member states may also impose various sanctions and penalties in case we do not comply with locally applicable requirements. The CAT is involved in any procedure regarding the provision of advice on the conduct of efficacy follow-up, pharmacovigilance and risk management systems of ATMPs as provided for in ATMP legislation.\nOff-label promotion of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The applicable laws at EU level and in the individual EU member states also prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. In addition, legislation adopted at the EU level and by individual EU member states require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. Promotion of indications not covered by the SmPC is specifically prohibited. ATMP legislation lays down certain minor extra labelling requirements for ATMPs.\nThe EMA is responsible for coordinating inspections to verify compliance with the principles of GCP, good manufacturing practice, or GMP, GLP, and good pharmacovigilance practice. These inspections are also intended to verify compliance with other aspects of the supervision of authorized medicinal products in use in the EU. The EMA coordinates any inspection by the relevant member state regulatory authority as requested by the CHMP in connection with the assessment of marketing authorization applications or matters referred to these committees. Inspections may be routine or triggered by issues arising during the assessment of the dossier or by other information, such as previous inspection experience. Inspections usually are requested during the initial review of a marketing authorization application, but could arise post-authorization.\nInspectors are drawn from the regulatory authorities of member states of the EU and the EEA. Following an inspection, the inspectors provide a written inspection report to the inspected site or applicant and provide an opportunity for response. Some inspection reports require follow-up and may result in additional adverse consequences due to critical or major findings. The inspectors and the CHMP will comment on any response from an inspected site or applicant and may monitor future compliance with any proposed corrective action plan.\nIn the GCP area, inspectors grade their findings according to the following scale:\n\n●   Critical: Conditions, practices or processes that adversely affect the rights, safety or well-being of the subjects or the quality and integrity of data. Observations classified as critical may include a pattern of deviations classified as major.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Major: Conditions, practices or processes that might adversely affect the rights, safety or well-being of the subjects and/or the quality and integrity of data. Observations classified as major may include a pattern of deviations or numerous minor observations.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n53\n\n\n\n\n●   Minor: Conditions, practices or processes that would not be expected to adversely affect the rights, safety or wellbeing of the subjects or the quality and integrity of data. Minor observations indicate the need for improvement of conditions, practices and processes.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Comments: Suggestions on how to improve quality or reduce the potential for a deviation to occur in the future.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPossible consequences of critical and major findings include rejection of clinical trial data, causing significant delays in obtaining final marketing authorization, or other direct action by national regulatory authorities.\nFalsified Medicines Directive – As of February 2019, new legislation required manufacturers of marketed prescription medicines to place safety features on all medicines and contribute financially to the establishment of a verification system allowing the authenticity of a medicine to be assessed at the time of supply to the patient. Under the legislation, all packages of prescription medicines placed on the market in Europe have to bear two safety features: a unique identifier in the form of a two-dimensional data matrix (barcode) and an anti-tamper device. In addition, ATMP legislation requires a procedure for tracing the product and its starting and raw materials from its source to the site where the product is used.\nEarly access programs\nMany jurisdictions allow the supply of unauthorized medicinal products in the context of strictly regulated and exceptional EAP programs, and some countries may provide reimbursement for drugs provided in the context of such programs. In the EU, the legal basis for EAP programs, also referred to as named-patient and compassionate use programs, is set out in the EU legislation regulating the authorization, manufacture, distribution and marketing of medicinal products. Detailed regulatory requirements applicable to EAP programs have been adopted and implemented by EU member states in their national laws. The promotion, advertising and marketing of unauthorized medicinal products is generally prohibited, and authorization for EAP programs must generally be obtained from national competent authorities, which might not grant such authorization. Obtaining authorization for an EAP program in one country does not ensure that authorization will be obtained in another country.\nU.S. law permits “expanded access” (also known as compassionate use and treatment use) for certain patients with serious diseases who have no comparable alternative treatment options. The potential patient benefit must justify the potential risks of the treatment use and those potential risks must not be unreasonable in the context of the disease or condition to be treated. Moreover, providing the investigational drug or biologic for the requested use must not interfere with the initiation, conduct, or completion of clinical investigations that could support marketing approval of the expanded access use or otherwise compromise the potential development of the expanded access use. Additional requirements apply depending on the size of the expanded access population. To provide expanded access, sponsors, including individual physicians, must submit detailed regulatory information to the FDA and receive the agency’s approval for the use. However, if there is an emergency that requires that a patient be treated before a written submission can be made, the FDA may authorize the expanded access use by telephone. In such a case, a written expanded access submission must be submitted to the FDA within fifteen working days of the FDA’s authorization. Following approval for expanded access use, both the sponsor of the use and the investigator (i.e., physician) must comply with certain FDA requirements. Sponsors may not promote products as safe or effective for expanded-access uses.\nPharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement\nThe containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and ex-U.S. governments, and the prices of pharmaceuticals have been a focus of this effort. Ex-U.S. governments, the U.S. government, and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls (e.g., inflation penalties and price caps), increases in rebates paid, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.\nIn some countries, particularly the countries of the EU, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing and reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product and there is only limited EU-level control over the decision-making autonomy of the government authorities including in relation to timing, justification and the ability to challenge such decisions. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices \n\n\n54\n\n\n\nand reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. In some countries, governments can set conditions that must be satisfied for prices to be set at a certain value. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states, and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high- priced member states), can further reduce prices. In some countries we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product or product candidate to other available therapies in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval.\nIn the United States, federal price reporting laws require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics (e.g., average manufacturer price, Best Price, and average sales price) used to determine prescription rebates paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and amounts reimbursed pharmacies and other providers by the Medicaid and Medicare programs. Various state healthcare programs similarly obligate us to report drug pricing information that is used as the basis for their reimbursement of pharmacies and other healthcare providers and the negotiation of supplemental rebates. Payment for a manufacturer’s drugs by these programs is conditioned on submission of this pricing information. Some government healthcare programs impose penalties if drug price increases exceed specified percentages or inflation rates, and these penalties can result in mandatory penny prices for certain federal and 340B program customers. States, such as California, have also enacted transparency laws that require manufacturers to report price increases and related information, and may cap price increases, or require negotiation of supplemental rebates for new drugs entering the market at price points determined to be high. Refusal to negotiate supplemental rebates can negatively affect market access and provider reimbursement. States, such as Maryland, have also established Drug Affordability Review Boards for the purpose of establishing upper payment limits for certain high-cost drugs which, if implemented, could result in reduced reimbursement for those products. Failure to comply with the rules for calculating and submitting pricing information or otherwise overcharging the government or its beneficiaries may result in criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions, and expose us to federal civil False Claims Act, or the False Claims Act, liability.\nThe Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 requires, as a condition of payment by certain federal agencies and the Medicaid program, that manufacturers of “covered drugs” (including all drugs approved under an NDA) enter into a Master Agreement and Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs through which their covered drugs must be offered for sale at a mandatory calculated ceiling price to certain federal agencies, including the VA and Department of Defense. FSS contracts require compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations, including disclosure of commercial prices during contract negotiations and maintenance of price relationships during the term of the contract, and subject manufacturers to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions. The Veterans Health Care Act also requires manufacturers to enter into pricing agreements with the Department of Health and Human Services to charge no more than a different ceiling price (derived from the Medicaid rebate percentage) to covered entities participating in the 340B drug discount program. Failure to accurately report drug pricing or to provide the mandatory discount may subject the manufacturer to specific civil monetary penalties. Termination of either of these agreements also jeopardizes payment by Medicaid and Medicare for the manufacturer’s drugs in an outpatient setting. Certain states have also enacted drug price transparency laws that require reporting of pricing information, including certain increases in a drug’s wholesale acquisition cost and the reasons causing the price increase.\nCoverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. For example, in the United States, healthcare reform measures under the Affordable Care Act, contain provisions that may affect the profitability of drug products. However, since its passage, Congress has repealed and amended certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, repeal efforts may occur again, and legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act may contribute to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the Affordable Care Act and underscore the potential for additional reform going forward. Certain provisions of enacted or proposed legislative changes may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of, or rebates paid by manufacturers for, healthcare items and services. We cannot assure that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nLegislators and regulators at both the federal and state level are increasingly focused on containing the cost of drugs, and there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other \n\n\n55\n\n\n\nthings, bring more transparency to drug pricing, penalize companies that do not agree to cap prices paid for certain drugs, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, in 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP), which among other things, revises the manner in which the “average manufacturer price” or AMP is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. More recently, Congress amended the Medicaid statute, effective October 1, 2019, to exclude prices paid by secondary manufacturers for an authorized generic drug (but not a product approved under the BLA process) from the NDA holder’s AMP for the brand, thereby increasing the rebate amount and the 340B price for the brand. This was implemented by CMS in a final rule issued December 31, 2020. The rule also expanded the definition of products identified as “line extensions” and, in certain circumstances, required inclusion of patient copay assistance in Medicaid best price (effective January 1, 2023), thereby potentially increasing Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers for such drugs. 340B program guidance regulations on civil monetary penalties for statutory violations, which had been finalized in early 2017 but deferred, also recently went into effect. \nOn November 27, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing a Most Favored Nation payment model under which reimbursement for certain Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals will be based on a price that reflects the lowest per capita Gross Domestic Product-adjusted (GDP-adjusted) price of any non-U.S. member country of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a GDP per capita that is at least sixty percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. This rule now has been rescinded, but other efforts to address the costs of pharmaceuticals have been adopted, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires manufacturers of selected drugs to negotiate discounted prices with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Failure to reach an agreement can subject manufacturers to an excise tax or withdraw of all drug products from coverage under Medicare and Medicaid. Drug price negotiations and other program implementation measures could potentially be affected by the Executive Order, Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions, issued on January 20, 2025 and/or the anticipated change in leadership at Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under the new administration. These and any additional healthcare reform measures could further constrain our business or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in additional pricing pressures.\nAny regulatory approval of a product is limited to specific diseases and indications for which such product has been deemed safe and effective by the FDA. Coverage by federal healthcare programs, however, may be more limited than the indications for which a drug is approved by the FDA or comparable ex-U.S. regulatory authorities’ coverage of the same products. Sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs (such as, in the United States, Medicare and Medicaid), private health insurers and other organizations. Obtaining reimbursement for orphan drugs may be particularly difficult because of the significant research and development challenges and costs and resulting pricing considerations typically associated with drugs developed to treat conditions that affect a small population of patients. Certain drugs with an orphan designation may also become subject to price negotiations under the IRA. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement in connection with drugs that are perceived as having high costs. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors.\nThe process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third- party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our product or product candidates or conduct direct head-to-head studies to demonstrate clinical superiority and cost-effectiveness. Our products and product candidates may not be considered clinically superior and cost-effective to competitor products.\nThe marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and other third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement.\n\n\n56\n\n\n\nFreedom of Information Requests and Affirmative Disclosures\nWe are also subject, in the U.S. and many other countries, to various regulatory schemes that require disclosure of clinical trial data or allow access to our data via freedom of information requests. We have been and may, from time to time, be notified by regulators, such as the EMA or the competent authorities of EU member states that they have received a freedom of information request for documents that they hold relating to our company, including information related to our product or our product candidates. For example, in 2015, we were notified by the EMA that it had received from another pharmaceutical company a request under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 seeking access to aspects of our marketing authorization application for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Following the decision of the EMA to release such documentation with only minimal redactions we initiated litigation before the General Court of the EU to prevent disclosure of this information. In the first quarter of 2018, the Court ruled in favor of the EMA, allowing the EMA to release the documentation. We appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice of the EU, or CJEU, but the CJEU dismissed our appeal in January 2020 and released the information to the requester. In addition, under policies recently adopted in the EU, clinical trial data submitted to the EMA in MAAs that were traditionally regarded as confidential commercial information is now subject to automatic public disclosure. Further, under the Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, the sponsor of an EU trial must submit a summary of the results to an EU database within a year of the end of the trial. In addition, where the trial was intended to be used for obtaining a marketing authorization the applicant must submit the clinical study report 30 days after MA has been granted, refused or withdrawn. Subject to our limited ability to review and redact a narrow sub-set of confidential commercial information, these new EU policies will result in the EMA’s public disclosure of certain of our clinical study reports, clinical trial data summaries and clinical overviews for recently completed and future MAA submissions. The move toward public disclosure of development data could adversely affect our business in many ways, including, for example, resulting in the disclosure of our confidential methodologies for development of our products, preventing us from obtaining intellectual property right protection for innovations, requiring us to allocate significant resources to prevent other companies from violating our intellectual property rights, adding even more complexity to processing health data from clinical trials consistent with applicable privacy and data protection regulations, and enabling competitors to use our data to gain approvals for their own products.\nFraud and Abuse Laws\nAny present or future arrangements or interactions with third-party payors, healthcare professionals, healthcare organizations, patients and other customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may restrict certain marketing and contracting practices. These laws include, and are not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims statutes and civil monetary penalties.\nBoth the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and the UK Bribery Act of 2010, or Bribery Act are broad in scope and will require companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA prohibits the offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official, political party or candidate for public office in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure any other improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. The FCPA also prohibits any U.S. person from corruptly acting outside the U.S. in furtherance of such offer, promise or payment. Under the UK Bribery Act, companies which carry on a business or part of a business in the United Kingdom may be held liable for bribes given, offered or promised to any person, including non-UK government officials and private persons, by employees and persons associated with the company in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company. Similar statutes have been adopted, or may be adopted in the future, by other countries in which we operate and with which we are or may be required to comply.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, or order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute imposes criminal penalties and has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others. Although a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors exist to protect certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors for this statute are narrow, and practices that involve \n\n\n57\n\n\n\ncompensation intended to induce prescriptions, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. HHS recently promulgated a regulation that is effective in two phases. First, the regulation excludes from the definition of “remuneration” limited categories of (a) PBM rebates or other reductions in price to a plan sponsor under Medicare Part D or a Medicaid Managed Care Organization plan reflected in point-of sale reductions in price and (b) PBM service fees. Second, the regulation expressly provides that rebates to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D either directly to the plan sponsor under Medicare Part D, or indirectly through a pharmacy benefit manager will not be protected under the anti-kickback statute discount safe harbor. The effective date of the two new safe harbors and the revision to the discount safe harbor was delayed by court order until January 1, 2023. Recent legislation further delayed implementation of the new safe harbors and the revision to the discount safe harbor until January 1, 2032. Our practices may not always meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection. A person or entity need not have knowledge of the statutes or the specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert as a matter of law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Federal enforcement agencies have shown increased interest under the federal Anti-Kickback Stature and the federal civil False Claims Act in pharmaceutical companies’ product and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services and donations to independent charitable patient assistance programs. A number of investigations into these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. Most states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs; furthermore, in several states, these statutes and regulations apply regardless of the payor, including to commercial plans. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer and its products from participation in federal healthcare programs, debarment from federal government procurement and non-procurement programs, criminal fines, and imprisonment. Several other countries, including the United Kingdom, have enacted similar anti-kickback, fraud and abuse laws and regulations.\nThe federal civil False Claims Act imposes civil liability and penalties on individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Claims under the federal civil False Claims Act may be initiated by whistleblowers, who receive substantial financial incentives to come forward, through “qui tam” actions that can be pursued by the whistleblower even if the government declines to prosecute the case. Intent to deceive or actual knowledge of falsity is not necessary to establish civil liability, which may be predicated on deliberate indifference or reckless disregard for the truth. The federal government continues to use the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in investigations against pharmaceutical and healthcare companies. These investigations have involved, for example, allegations of improper financial relationships with referral sources, providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the free product, as well as the promotion of products for unapproved uses and reporting false pricing information. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a per se violation of civil False Claims Act. Potential liability under the federal civil False Claims Act includes treble damages and significant per claim penalties. The criminal federal False Claims Act imposes criminal fines or imprisonment against individuals or entities who make or present a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent. Conviction or civil judgment for violation of the False Claims Act can also result in debarment from federal government procurement and non-procurement programs and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.\nThe Affordable Care Act included a provision requiring certain providers and suppliers of items and services to federal healthcare programs to report and return overpayments within sixty days after they are “identified” (the “Overpayment Statute”), after which the recipient of the overpayment incurs federal civil False Claims Act liability. The law prohibits a recipient of a payment from the government from keeping an overpayment when the government mistakenly pays more than the amount to which the recipient is entitled even if the overpayment is not caused by any conduct of the recipient. In 2014 and 2016, the CMS released regulatory guidance (in the form of final rules) to Medicare providers, suppliers and managed care and prescription drug plans regarding how to comply with the Overpayment Statute. Although these Medicare providers, suppliers and plans have faced federal False Claims Act liability since 2010 for failures to comply with the Overpayment Statute, these final rules interpreting the Overpayment Statute provide guidance regarding how to comply with applicable obligations, and guidance to government regulators and enforcement authorities regarding \n\n\n58\n\n\n\nmonitoring and prosecuting suspected violations. These final rules are not directly applicable to manufacturers, unless a manufacturer is a direct recipient of payment by an agency such as a research grant, but may impact a manufacturer’s customers and potential customers who are Medicare providers, suppliers, and plans. In a final rule issued on December 9, 2024, CMS set revised standards for identifying and returning overpayments to Medicare, clarifying the sixty-day overpayment refund obligation. Among other changes, the rule clarifies and modifies when an overpayment is identified and when the 60-day timeclock for reporting the overpayment begins, adopting the False Claims Act liability standard that does not consider the time needed to quantify the potential overpayment, thereby increasing the risk of incurring federal civil False Claims Act liability. The final rule does, however, allow for suspension of the sixty-day clock for 180 days for the purpose of conducting a timely, good faith investigation to determine the existence of related overpayments that may arise from the same or similar cause or reason as the initially identified overpayment.\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value made to or at the request of covered recipients, such as, but not limited to, physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives licensed in the United States and to US teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and members of their immediate family. Payments made to physicians, other principal investigators and certain research institutions for research, including clinical trials, are included within the ambit of this law. Such information is made publicly available by CMS in a searchable format, with data collected in each calendar year published the following June. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties, with increased penalties for “knowing failures,” for each payment, transfer of value or ownership or investment interest not timely and accurately reported in an annual submission. If not preempted by this federal law, several states currently require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to healthcare professionals in those states. Depending on the state, legislation may prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as gift bans, or require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, certain states, such as California, Nevada, Connecticut and Massachusetts, require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct and several other states are considering similar proposals. Manufacturers that fail to comply with these state laws can face civil penalties.\nStatutory requirements to disclose publicly payments made to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations have also been enacted in certain European Union member states. In addition, self-regulatory bodies of the pharmaceuticals industry, such as the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, or EFPIA, have published codes of conduct to which its members have agreed to abide, that require the public disclosure of payments made to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations. In some countries (including France, Denmark and Portugal) such requirements are enforceable by law.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent requirement of certain of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation. \nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH Act, also imposes obligations on certain entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy and security of certain individually identifiable health information, known as protected health information. Among other things, the HITECH Act and its implementing regulations make HIPAA’s security and certain privacy standards directly applicable to “business \n\n\n59\n\n\n\nassociates”, defined as persons or organizations who, on behalf of covered entities create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. The HITECH Act also strengthened the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and individuals, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, other federal and state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, may regulate the privacy and security of personal information that we maintain, many of which may differ from each other in significant ways. Since the CCPA was signed into law in 2018, numerous other states, including Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut, have enacted similar privacy laws that may apply to personal information that we collect or maintain. As well, beginning in 2023, several states have enacted privacy laws specific to consumer health data, which may also apply to personal information that we collect or maintain.\nOutside of the U.S., additional privacy and data protection laws may apply to our operations. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the UK General Data Protection Regulation and related data protection, cybersecurity and e-privacy laws in the EU/EEA and the UK, collectively, the GDPR, and equivalent Swiss laws may apply to some or all of the clinical or other personal data obtained, transmitted, or stored from those jurisdictions. These laws require in many circumstances specific, freely given and fully informed consent to be obtained from patients or clinical study participants or other lawful bases for processing. There are also other requirements for lawful processing, including transparency obligations, data minimization requirements, data transfer restrictions and compliance obligations with individuals’ stringent rights to access their personal data and to otherwise control the processing of their personal data. There are data breach notification obligations, to supervisory authorities and to individuals, where certain risk thresholds to them have occurred. The GDPR and Swiss laws only permit transfer of personal data to countries where there is adequate protection as determined by the relevant EU/UK/Swiss governmental authorities or where other mechanisms are in place such as Standard Contractual Clauses or the EU/UK/Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework.\nThe GDPR and Swiss law, among others, allow supervisory authorities to potentially impose high regulatory fines in the event of violations, for example, under the GDPR up to 4% of global annual group turnover or EUR 20 million (whichever is the higher amount). Supervisory authorities in the EU/EEA, Switzerland and UK may potentially levy such fines directly upon on the non-compliant entity and/or on the parent company of the non-compliant entity. Supervisory authorities also possess other wide-ranging powers, including conducting unannounced inspections of our facilities and system (so-called “dawn raids”), and issuing “stop processing” orders to us. Separate from regulatory enforcement actions, individuals may bring private actions (including potentially group or representative actions) against us. There is no statutory cap in the GDPR on the amount of compensation or the damages which individuals may recover. Overall, the significant costs of GDPR and Swiss law compliance, risk of regulatory enforcement actions and private litigation under, and other burdens imposed by these laws as well as under other regulatory schemes throughout the world related to privacy and security of health information and other personal and private data could have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations. We may also be subject to additional industry-specific privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, operational and information systems resilience, and artificial intelligence-related laws in the EU/EEA, Switzerland and the UK which may subject us to additional similar risks and impacts.\nIn addition, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct. In the United States, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with these industry and physician codes and the relevant compliance guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers promulgated by the federal government. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national laws of the EU member states, as well as codes of conduct issued by self-regulatory industry bodies. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, their competent professional organization, and the competent authorities of the individual EU member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU member states.\n\n\n60\n\n\n\nAny continuing efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act, could have an impact on fraud and abuse provisions and other requirements, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, that were authorized and enacted under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 939 employees and 66 consultants and contractors. None of our U.S. based employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements, although certain international employees are covered by collective labor agreements established under local law. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. \nWe believe that our growth and success is dependent on the contributions of our employees, as led by our executive officers. We focus significant attention on attracting, retaining, engaging, and further developing talented and experienced individuals to manage and support our operations. In particular, recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing, commercial, marketing and support personnel is critical to our success. Competition for these skilled personnel is high. We believe that our strong culture of teamwork and desire to be ever better help us attract and retain employees. Our employees complete Gallup, Inc.’s Clifton Strengths talent assessment and attend related training sessions. These tools have been implemented to help our employees identify their core strengths and learn how to use these strengths to become more engaged and productive at work as well as to lead an overall more satisfying and healthier lifestyle. Our Brazilian office was recognized as a “great place to work” by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2022, 2023 and 2024.\nBased on external benchmarks, we offer employees a number of additional resources and tools to help in their personal and professional development, including career coaching, targeted leadership development for identified current and emerging leaders, internal and external development programs, professional assessment tools, a paid subscription to a digital on-demand career and management learning solutions platform and a wellness website through which employees may access information regarding scheduled healthy lifestyle activities, articles and other beneficial resources. To help newly hired employees, our global onboarding team conducts monthly surveys and focus groups and each newly hired employee is paired with a “buddy” to assist in their transition. Also, we require specialized leadership training for all employees responsible for managing others within our organization. In 2023, we established a center of excellence for coaching and mentoring, with 60 mentorships in place as of December 31, 2024. In 2024, we delivered more than 4,000 training hours (excluding compliance and role-specific training), offered 28 learning sessions to all employees, and 30 customized training sessions to teams. We have also delivered more than 130 coaching hours with internal coaches. Our executive team routinely reviews employee turnover throughout the organization to monitor employee satisfaction. Over the last four years, our voluntary turnover rate has been below 10%.\nWe believe that we provide a competitive total reward offering to our employees, with market competitive cash compensation, equity, and industry competitive company-paid benefits, including subsidized medical, and dental insurance and retirement plans, as well as group vision insurance, tuition reimbursement, and benefits and policies to support parental leave, mental health and wellness, family planning and child bonding. In 2023, we implemented a program that offers financial support and access to high quality fertility care and family forming benefits to our employees. Total rewards offerings are established by employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location. We also provide flexible work arrangements for our employees, including remote work options when practicable. In addition, to assist our employees during times of personal disasters that impact them and their families, we have established an employee relief program that is funded by our employees with corporate matches.\nWe are committed to hiring, developing, and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace, and continue to focus on extending our equality, diversity, and inclusion initiatives across our workforce. All of our employees are required to adhere to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and all relevant country regulations which sets forth the high level of integrity, legal compliance and patient-centric focus expected of all our employees. We have a team of professionals that oversees our culture and community program. The mission of our culture and community team is to collaborate with cross functional partners and create intentional efforts to connect and engage with employees who want to find community and apply their passion to make a difference. A core element of this mission is our equality, diversity and inclusion, or ED&I, program which is managed by an ED&I professional, who routinely meets with our executive committee. Our ED&I program seeks to enable all employees to feel a sense of purpose and belonging through their connections with our internal \n\n\n61\n\n\n\ncommunities. This program is guided by a steering committee comprised of senior leaders, volunteer ED&I ambassadors and representatives from our seven Employee Resource Groups, or ERGs, each of which associates with a different underrepresented community. Our ERGs meet monthly and serve to offer a safe place for our employees to have conversations about social issues, celebrate cultural observances and to grow as individuals. We believe that our ERGs and our ED&I program help our employees to better understand and celebrate each other, resulting in a more cohesive work environment.\nWe continue to provide opportunities for talented individuals through our global Talent Pipeline Program, or the TPP. The TPP is a global fellowship program aimed at providing recent diverse graduates real-world experience in the biopharmaceutical industry and related professions, including research, clinical, finance, commercial, marketing, compliance, quality, legal, information technology, human resources, government affairs, and communications. Participants are recruited from a diverse global group of institutions and networks and are provided mentorship, job coaching, career counseling, and leadership training for one year. Participants from the TPP are often offered full-time positions based upon our workforce needs. The TPP was originally established in 2020 to benefit students that graduated during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur Corporate Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 500 Warren Corp Center Drive, Warren, New Jersey 07059.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates\nIf we are unable to continue to execute our commercial strategy for our products, fail to obtain renewal of, or satisfy the conditions of our marketing authorization for our products, or if we experience significant delays in accomplishing such goals, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources to bring our products to market through research and development, collaborations and acquisitions. Our ability to continue to generate product revenues will depend heavily on the successful commercialization of our products.\nIf we do not successfully maintain our marketing authorizations for our products and obtain new marketing authorizations for our product candidates and new uses of our approved products, our ability to generate additional revenue will be \n\n\n62\n\n\n\njeopardized and, consequently, our business will be materially harmed. Additionally, our ability to make our licensed products available within the relevant territories is largely dependent upon the maintenance of the marketing authorizations by the licensor. The success of our products will depend on a number of additional factors, including the following:\n\n●   our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement terms on a timely basis, or at all;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the timing, scope and outcome of commercial launches;\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the maintenance and expansion of a commercial infrastructure capable of supporting product sales, marketing and distribution;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the implementation and maintenance of marketing and distribution relationships with third parties in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to establish and maintain commercial manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability or the ability of our third-party manufacturers to successfully produce commercial and clinical supply of drug on a timely basis sufficient to meet the needs of our commercial and clinical activities;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   successful identification of eligible patients;\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n●   acceptance of the drug as a treatment for the approved indication by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   effectively competing with other therapies;\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n●   global trade policies;\n--------------------------\n\n●   a continued acceptable safety profile of the drug;\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the costs, timing and outcome of post-marketing studies and trials required for our products;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio, obtaining and maintaining regulatory exclusivity and whether we are able to maintain market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act or equivalent protections in other jurisdictions;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   whether negative results from our clinical or pre-clinical trials of a product for one indication affect the perception of such product in another indication, including with respect to determinations by regulators, including the FDA and EMA, with respect to our ongoing or future regulatory submissions for marketing authorization of our products for any indication;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   whether, with respect to Translarna, we are able to continue to satisfy our obligations under, and maintain, the marketing authorization in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, including whether the EMA determines on an annual basis that the benefit-risk balance of Translarna supports renewal of our marketing authorization in the EEA, on the current approved label;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   whether, and within what timeframe, we are able to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to complete certain FDA post-marketing requirements in connection with our marketing authorization of Kebilidi;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to obtain additional and maintain existing reimbursed named patient and cohort EAP programs for our products on adequate terms;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to successfully prepare and advance regulatory submissions for marketing authorizations for our products in additional territories and for additional or expanded indications and whether and in what timeframe we may obtain such authorizations; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the ability and willingness of patients and healthcare professionals to access our products through alternative means if pricing and reimbursement negotiations in the applicable territory do not have a positive outcome.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to continue to commercialize our products, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n63\n\n\n\nDelays or failures in obtaining regulatory approval would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the applicable territory and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. Moreover, should we need to conduct additional development work, other than those we have planned, we expect to incur significant costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere is significant risk that we will be unable to obtain approval for our product candidates on a timely basis or at all, and we may be required to perform additional clinical trials, non-clinical studies or CMC assessments, work, or analyses at significant cost. Product development is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. This is especially true for rare and/or complicated diseases and new or novel products. A failure of one or more clinical or preclinical trials, or manufacturing development can occur at any stage. Preclinical and clinical studies may also reveal unfavorable product candidate characteristics, including safety concerns, or may not demonstrate product candidate efficacy. There can be significant variability in results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing authorization of their products.\nThe approval process is also subject to the substantial discretion of regulatory authorities and the approval procedures vary among countries, can involve additional testing, and the time for approval may materially differ and be subject to administrative delays that we cannot control. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may compromise our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. \nIn response to changes in the regulatory environment or requests from regulators, we may elect, or be obliged, to postpone a regulatory submission to include additional analyses, which could cause delays in getting our products to market and substantially increase our costs. Securing marketing authorization also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection or conduct of remote regulatory assessments of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Changes to manufacturers, product candidate formulation, manufacturing processes and other product candidate attributes, such as the method of delivery, during product candidate development may also require additional studies to demonstrate the comparability of the product candidate using prior processes, formulation, or manufacturers, or with the prior attributes, to the product candidate using new the processes, formulation, or manufacturers, or with the new attributes.\nFor example, we have been seeking FDA approval for Translarna for nmDMD with the FDA since 2010 and the FDA has repeatedly disagreed with our interpretation of our results. In October 2017, the Office of Drug Evaluation I of the FDA issued a CRL for the NDA, stating that it was unable to approve the application in its current form. In response, we filed a formal dispute resolution request with the Office of New Drugs of the FDA. In February 2018, the Office of New Drugs of the FDA denied our appeal of the CRL. In its response, the Office of New Drugs recommended a possible path forward for the ataluren NDA submission based on the accelerated approval pathway. This would involve a re-submission of an NDA containing the current data on effectiveness of ataluren with new data to be generated on dystrophin production in nmDMD patients’ muscles. We followed the FDA’s recommendation and collected, using newer technologies via procedures and methods that we designed, such dystrophin data in a new study, Study 045, and announced the results of Study 045 in February 2021. Study 045 did not meet its pre-specified primary endpoint. In June 2022, we announced top-line results from the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041. Following this announcement, we submitted a meeting request to the FDA to gain clarity on the regulatory pathway for a potential re-submission of an NDA for Translarna. The FDA provided initial written feedback that Study 041 does not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness to support NDA re-submission. We held a Type C meeting with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 to discuss the totality of Translarna data. Based on feedback from the FDA, we re-submitted the NDA in July 2024, based on the results from Study 041 and from our international drug registry study for nmDMD patients receiving Translarna. In October 2024, the FDA accepted for review the resubmission of the NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. As this was an NDA resubmission following a CRL to the NDA which was filed over protest in 2016, the FDA is not obligated to follow the review timelines under PDUFA guidelines and an action date has not been provided.\n\n\n64\n\n\n\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve our milestones at all or within our anticipated timeframes, or that regulators may have additional questions to which we will need to respond. There is also substantial risk that the results of our future or current studies will not ultimately support the approval of a product candidate. Regulators may also request additional studies, data and information, that we may need to develop and which were not originally planned for. Any delays in obtaining regulatory approval, or if we never obtain regulatory approval, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to commercialize Translarna for nmDMD in the EEA if the EC adopts the negative opinion issued by the CHMP for the renewal of the existing conditional authorization for Translarna.\nOur marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged two years and older in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the EC following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization. In September 2022, we submitted a Type II variation to the EMA to support conversion of the conditional marketing authorization for Translarna to a standard marketing authorization, which included a report on the placebo-controlled trial of Study 041 and data from the open-label extension. In February 2023, we also submitted an annual marketing authorization renewal request to the EMA. In September 2023, the CHMP gave a negative opinion on the conversion of the conditional marketing authorization to full marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and a negative opinion on the renewal of the existing conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. In January 2024, the CHMP issued a negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure. In May 2024, the EC decided not to adopt the CHMP’s negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna and returned such opinion to the CHMP for re-evaluation. In June 2024, following the EC’s request for re-review, the CHMP issued a negative opinion on the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. On October 18, 2024, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following the requested reexamination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the EC has 67 days from the date of issuance to adopt the opinion. At this time, the EC has not yet adopted the negative opinion. If the EC adopts the negative opinion, Translarna would no longer have marketing authorization in the member states of the EEA.\nGiven the negative opinion from the CHMP, we believe that it is likely that the EC will refuse to renew the marketing authorization for Translarna. While we are exploring other potential mechanisms in which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA, we may be unable to identify processes that are both possible within the regulatory frameworks of individual EEA countries and commercially viable. As such, there is substantial risk to our ability to maintain our conditional marketing authorization in the EEA and our ability to commercialize Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA. If we are unable to renew our conditional marketing authorization in the EEA or we are unable to identify other potential mechanisms in which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA, we would lose all, or a significant portion of, our ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna in the EEA, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nAdditionally, the CHMP’s negative opinion for Translarna and potential loss of the Translarna marketing authorization in the EEA may influence regulatory entities in other jurisdictions in which Translarna has been approved to reassess such approvals. For example, certain countries reference or depend on the determination by the EMA when considering the grant of a marketing authorization. There is substantial risk that we would be unable to maintain our marketing authorizations in these countries in the event the EC decides not to renew or otherwise varies, suspends or withdraws our marketing authorization in the EEA. Even in countries where our marketing authorization is maintained, there may be an impact on pricing and reimbursement of Translarna within those countries. Any potential reassessments or scheduled renewals of our marketing authorizations or impacts to pricing and reimbursement may lead to additional regulatory costs, requirements to complete additional clinical trials, restrictions on or removal of our marketing authorizations or loss of a significant portion of our revenue for Translarna in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n65\n\n\n\nWe may use certain specialized pathways to develop our product candidates or to seek approval. We may not qualify for these pathways or such pathways may not ultimately speed the time to approval or result in product candidate approval.\nIn the United States, we may pursue the accelerated approval pathway for certain of our product candidates. However, the FDA may find that our product candidates do not qualify for accelerated approval. Moreover, even if we do ultimately receive accelerated approval, we would need to meet certain post approval requirements, such as completing a post-approval study confirming our product candidates’ clinical benefit that may require substantial time, effort, and funds. The FDA must specify the conditions for the required post approval studies, including enrollment targets, the study protocol, milestones, and target completion dates, by the time of approval and the FDA may require that the post-approval studies be commenced before the date of approval. If this study does not confirm the product’s clinical benefit or if the study is not conducted in accordance with the FDA’s requirements, it would be subject to the risk of expedited FDA withdrawal. Additional regulatory requirements also include the pre-submission of promotional materials to the FDA and potential restrictions, such as distribution restrictions, to assure the product’s safe use. In recent years, the accelerated approval pathway has come under significant governmental and public scrutiny. Accordingly, depending on the results of our studies, the FDA may be more conservative in granting accelerated approval or, if granted, may be more apt to withdrawal approval if clinical benefit is not confirmed. Due to these and other uncertainties, we are unable to estimate the timing or potential for product candidates for which we may use the accelerated approval pathway or the cost or effort required to receive FDA approval. Further, even if we receive accelerated approval, there is no guarantee that we would be able to maintain such approval. For instance, our confirmatory studies may not confirm a product’s clinical benefit, in which case, the FDA could withdraw the product from the market, we may choose to voluntarily withdraw the product from the market, or we may need to conduct further studies to determine whether the product has a clinical benefit.\nMoreover, we may pursue other product designations or programs that are designed to facilitate drug development. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain any such designations or, if obtained, that we will be able to maintain them. For instance, the FDA may find that, following designation, our product candidates no longer qualify for the designation due to changed circumstances or study results. This may result in the FDA rescinding a designation that we previously received. Any such designation also may not expedite or otherwise facilitate product development.\nIf we or our collaborators experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials related to our products or our product candidates, maintenance of our existing marketing authorization for our products and any additional potential marketing authorization or commercialization of our products or our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nWe or our collaborators may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing authorization or commercialize our products or our product candidates, including:\n\n●   clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, regulators may disagree with our interpretation of results, our studies may fail to reach the necessary level of statistical significance, or we may not be able to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe, effective, or provide an advantage over current standard of care or other therapies;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our clinical trials may not meet their primary endpoints. For example, for Translarna, the primary efficacy endpoint in the intent to treat, or ITT, population did not achieve statistical significance in the Phase 2b trial (completed in 2009), Phase 3 trial in ACT DMD (completed in 2015), or Study 045 (completed in 2021);\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   there may be flaws in our clinical trials’ design that may not become apparent until the clinical trials are well advanced or regulators may not agree with the design of our studies or our analysis of the resulting data;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   clinical trial sites or enrolled patients, as well as the resulting data, may be negatively affected by outbreaks of contagious disease, resulting in delays and disruptions in completing clinical trials, such as the delays we experienced in 2021 and 2022 in enrolling a Phase 2/3 placebo-controlled trial of vatiquinone in children with mitochondrial disease associated seizures trial as some patients were unable or hesitant to travel to clinical trial sites due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The exact impact of any contagious disease outbreak may not be fully known until the applicable trials are complete or are submitted to the applicable regulatory authorities;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we may be unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials, the number of patients required for clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n66\n\n\n\n\nanticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials, not comply with trial procedures, misrepresent their eligibility, or be lost to follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we may enroll patients in foreign countries in which clinical sites may have less experience with studies or the disease at issue, or may use a different standard of care;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   regulatory authorities may not accept the data generated at foreign sites or may find that such data is not sufficiently representative of the population of the approving country;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or we may be required to engage in additional clinical trial site monitoring;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   regulators, institutional review boards, institutional biosafety committees, or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence or continue a clinical trial, may require additional data or studies, or may require changes to our studies, including applications and protocols;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we may be unable to engage trial sites and contract research organizations or they may withdraw from our studies;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we, regulators, institutional review boards, institutional biosafety committees, or independent ethics committees may require the suspension or termination of studies for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the cost of clinical trials of our products or our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate or we may have insufficient funds for a clinical trial or to pay the substantial user fees required by the FDA upon the filing of a marketing application;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the supply or quality of our products or our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our products or our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   regulators may require us to perform additional or unanticipated studies, develop additional manufacturing information, or make changes to our manufacturing process to obtain approval;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   there may be changes in the applicable regulatory authorities’ approval requirements, which may render our data insufficient to obtain marketing approval;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may disagree with our intended indications;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   regulators may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities for clinical and future commercial supplies;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may take longer than we anticipate to make a decision on our product candidates; or\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we may decide to abandon the development of a product candidate or development program.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nThese risks may be increased for product candidates intended for the treatment of diseases for which there is little clinical experience, where we are using new endpoints or methodologies, or where the product candidates are new or novel. For example, there are no marketed therapies approved to treat the underlying cause of nmDMD and there is limited clinical trial experience with respect to drugs to treat nmDMD and other diseases that we are studying or have studied. As a result, the design and conduct of clinical trials for these diseases, particularly for drugs to address the underlying nonsense mutations causing these diseases in some subsets of patients, is subject to increased risk. Furthermore, because gene therapy products are a relatively new development, less is known about such products and product candidates and, accordingly there is an increased risk that such products may not perform as expected. Regulatory review agencies and the requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. \nWe may also experience increased risks to the extent that products or product candidates require a specialized delivery device or method. For example, Upstaza/Kebilidi is administered directly to the putamen in the brain using stereotactic surgery, a brain surgery requiring significant skill and training. There is little experience with such surgeries being used to deliver drugs and for such surgeries being performed on children. We may need to train sufficient brain surgeons to perform the procedure properly, which may expose us to additional regulatory risks as our interactions with such healthcare providers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations. As a result, we will need to invest significant resources to ensure all personnel and contractors are adequately trained on these requirements and to monitor their conduct. Delivery of Upstaza/Kebilidi to the putamen also requires certain medical devices, which can increase our regulatory compliance obligations.\n\n\n67\n\n\n\nOur product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing authorizations, and we may not have sufficient funding to complete the testing and approval process for any of our product candidates. We may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials and prepare for possible commercialization of our products and product candidates. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our products or our product candidates and allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do or impair our ability to successfully commercialize our products or our product candidates, and so may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSubgroup, retrospective, post-hoc, and certain statistical analyses may not be reliable and typically will not form the basis for regulatory approval.\nIn the event that a study’s primary endpoint is not met, companies may undertake certain analyses to further understand the data and potential reasons for the study results, including retrospective, post-hoc, and subgroup analyses. Because these analyses are not pre-planned and studies may not be adequately designed for these analyses, they may not be reliable and typically will not form the basis for regulatory approval. For example, after determining that we did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint with the pre-specified level of statistical significance in our completed ACT DMD and Phase 2b clinical trials of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, we performed subgroup, retrospective, and meta-analyses. We submitted these analyses to the FDA as part of our NDA, taking the position that the totality of clinical data from these trials support the clinical benefit of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. The FDA, however, did not agree that these analyses supported approval.\nSome of our favorable statistical data from these trials also are based on nominal p-values. Nominal p-values are subject to certain limitations, and which, because of these limitations, regulatory authorities typically give less weight to nominal p-values, compared to regular p-values. For example, the p-values in ACT DMD for change from baseline at week 48 in the 6-minute walk test, or 6MWT (which we also refer to as 6-minute walk distance, or 6MWD) and each secondary end point timed function test were nominal p-values. The FDA found that certain post-hoc adjustments, our retrospective analyses and our reliance on nominal p-values for some of our statistical data did not support approval. \nAn unfavorable view of our data and analyses by regulatory authorities has and could continue to negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing authorizations, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and would materially harm our business, financial results and results of operations.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates, including clinical trials due to the inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients. Patient enrollment is affected a number of factors including:\n\n●   the size of the patient population (many of our studies concern rare conditions with small patient populations);\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the availability of approved treatments;\n--------------------------------------------\n\n●   severity of the disease under investigation;\n------------------------------------------------\n\n●   eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n●   perceived benefits and risks of the product candidate under study;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   disruptions caused by and the willingness of patients to enroll in a clinical trial during outbreaks of contagious disease;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   patient referral practices of physicians;\n---------------------------------------------\n\n●   competition from other clinical trials;\n-------------------------------------------\n\n●   the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n68\n\n\n\nFor example, we previously experienced delays in 2021 and 2022 enrolling a Phase 2/3 trial of vatiquinone in children with mitochondrial disease associated seizures as some patients were unable or hesitant to travel to clinical trial sites due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nEnrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates. Our inability to enroll, timely or at all, a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.\nIf serious adverse side effects are identified during the development of any product candidate or for any product for which we have or may obtain marketing approval, we may need to abandon or limit our development and/or marketing of that product or product candidate.\nIf our products or our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, regulatory authorities, institutional review boards, institutional biosafety committees, or independent ethics committees may place our studies on clinical hold, withdraw or suspend study approvals, or require that we modify our protocols. We may also need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a benefit-risk perspective. Adverse events or side effects may also result in study recruitment challenges, marketing authorization denial, limitations on the indicated use of a product, the inclusion of warnings, contraindications, or precautions on the label of any approved products, or significant conditions imposed on any approval, including the requirement of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety of the product. Adverse effects may also prevent the adoption of a product, if it is approved. Many compounds that initially showed promise in clinical or earlier stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. Furthermore, we may be sued and held liable for harm caused by our products to patients as a result of the identification of undesirable side effects, which may cause reputational harm.\nFor example, although we did not observe a pattern of liver enzyme elevations in our Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials of Translarna, we did observe modest elevations of liver enzymes in some subjects in one of our Phase 1 clinical trials. These elevated enzyme levels did not require cessation of Translarna administration, and enzyme levels typically normalized after completion of the treatment phase. We did not observe any increases in bilirubin, which can be associated with serious harm to the liver, in the Phase 1 clinical trial.\nIn addition, in Study 009, our first Phase 3 clinical trial of Translarna for the treatment of nmCF, five adverse events in the Translarna arm of the trial that involved the renal system led to discontinuation. As compared to the placebo group, the Translarna treatment arm also had a higher incidence of adverse events of creatinine elevations, which can be an indication of impaired kidney function. In the Translarna treatment arm, more severe clinically meaningful creatinine elevations were reported in conjunction with cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations. These creatinine elevations were associated with concomitant treatment with antibiotics associated with impaired kidney functions, such as aminoglycosides or vancomycin. This led to the subsequent prohibition of concomitant use of Translarna and these antibiotics, which was successful in addressing this issue in the clinical trial.\nThe risk of finding adverse side effects may be particularly heightened in the case of gene therapies. For instance, new gene copies may produce too much or too little of the desired protein or RNA, or the production of the desired protein or RNA may change over time. Because the treatment is irreversible, there may be challenges in managing side effects. Adverse effects would not be able to be reversed or relieved by stopping dosing and might require us to develop additional clinical safety procedures. Furthermore, new gene copies may disrupt other normal biological molecules and processes. Adverse side effects may also be experienced by patients as a result of the process for administering the therapy or related procedures.\nThere have been several significant adverse side effects in gene therapy treatments in the past, including reported cases of leukemia, immune- and complement-mediated responses, and death seen in other trials using other vectors. While new recombinant vectors have been developed to potentially reduce these side effects, gene therapy is still a relatively new approach to disease treatment and additional adverse side effects could develop. For instance, possible adverse side effects that could occur include an immunologic or complement-mediated reactions early after administration which, could \n\n\n69\n\n\n\nsubstantially limit the effectiveness of the treatment. Depending on the vector, additional manufacturing, clinical, and preclinical testing may be required, as well as additional analyses, assessments, and potential long-term patient and clinical study subject monitoring and sample testing and associated regulatory reporting. Serious adverse events in our clinical trials, or other clinical trials involving gene therapy products or our competitors’ products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could further adversely impact our product candidates in the form of increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays, stricter labeling requirements, and a decrease in demand.\nIf, following approval, we or others identify previously unknown side effects, if such side-effects are severe, or if known side effects are more frequent or severe than in the past then our marketing authorizations may be restricted or withdrawn, changes may be required to the product’s label, sales may be adversely impacted, we may be required to undertake additional studies or trials, and government investigations or litigation, including product liability claims, may be brought against us. Additionally, if the safety warnings in our product labels are not followed, adverse medical situations in patients may arise, resulting in negative publicity and potential lawsuits. Any of these occurrences would limit or prevent us from commercializing our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations.\n\nCertain of our products and product candidates may be difficult to produce, presenting manufacturing challenges that may delay product development and regulatory approval.\nManufacturers of pharmaceutical products must comply with strictly enforced manufacturing and quality requirements, including cGMP requirements, state and federal regulations, as well as ex-U.S. requirements when applicable. These may be particularly difficult to meet for complex products such as biologic and gene therapy products. Any failure to meet the applicable manufacturing and quality requirements could lead to a delay or interruption in development programs, delays in receiving regulatory approval, and consequences should we receive marketing approval.\nThe manufacture of drugs, and especially biologic and gene therapy products is technically complex, requires extreme precision to meet specification requirements and necessitates substantial expertise and capital investment. Production difficulties caused by unforeseen events, even if seemingly minimal, may delay the availability of material for clinical studies and commercial product. For example, given the nature of biologics manufacturing, there is a risk of contamination. Any contamination could materially adversely affect our ability to produce our gene therapy product candidates on schedule and could, therefore, harm our results of operations and cause reputational damage.\nIn addition, gene therapy products have only in limited cases been manufactured at scales sufficient for pivotal trials and commercialization. Few pharmaceutical contract manufacturers specialize in gene therapy products and those that do are still developing appropriate processes, controls and facilities for large-scale production. While we believe that there are alternative sources of supply that can satisfy our commercial requirements for Upstaza/Kebilidi, we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify and establish relationships with such sources, if necessary, in a timely manner or at all, and what the terms and costs of such new arrangements would be, or that such alternative suppliers would be able to supply our potential commercial needs. Any switch from our current manufacturer would result in a significant delay, would require regulatory authority approval, and cause material additional costs.\nFurthermore, some of the raw materials and other components required in our manufacturing process are derived from diverse biologic sources that may be difficult to procure and may be subject to contamination or recall. Any material shortage, supply chain disruption, contamination recall or restriction on the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of our product candidates could adversely impact or disrupt the production and commercialization of products.\nFinally, we and our third-party manufacturers may experience any number of unforeseen issues, unforeseen delays, including equipment failure, labor shortages, natural disasters, power failures, transportation difficulties, quality control or other issues, including those resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements, as further described in these risks, that could prevent us from realizing the intended benefits of our manufacturing strategy.\n\n\n70\n\n\n\nAny of our products or any other product candidate that receives marketing authorization may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining and maintaining marketing authorizations, our products may not gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. Third-party payors may require prior authorizations or failure on another type of treatment before covering a particular drug, particularly with respect to higher-priced drugs. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for a product or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product could reduce physician usage of the product. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues or any profits from operations.\nThe degree of market acceptance of our products or product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\n●   the efficacy and potential advantages, as well as cost effectiveness compared to alternative treatments;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the prevalence and severity of any side effects, as well as perceived safety;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   limitations or warnings contained in, as well as permitted claims based on the product’s FDA-approved labeling;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   whether patients may be ineligible to receive a particular product or whether a particular product, especially in the case of gene therapies, may preclude future treatments;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   distribution and use restrictions imposed by the FDA or which we voluntarily implement;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the ability to offer our products or product candidates for sale at competitive prices;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies. For example, gene therapy remains a novel technology and Upstaza/Kebilidi must be administered directly to the brain via a surgery and public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, which may cause gene therapy to not gain acceptance by the public or the medical community;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement and, where applicable, our ability to obtain pricing approvals which is separate from the marketing authorization process;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   adverse publicity about our and our competitors’ products or product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products or product candidates. For example, earlier gene therapy trials conducted by other organizations have led to several well-publicized adverse events, including cases of leukemia, immune- and complement-mediated adverse events, and death seen in other such organizations’ trials using vectors;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the results of studies of the product in other indications or similar products; and\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   any restrictions on concomitant use of other medications.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement for a product from third-party payers is a time-consuming and costly process. Failure to obtain adequate reimbursement may significantly impact the adoption and sale of products. Market acceptance and obtaining reimbursement coverage may be particularly challenging in the case of gene therapies, where the cost of a single administration may be substantial and adequate coverage and reimbursement will be essential for patients to afford the treatment. Payors may require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data, which we may not be able to provide. Moreover, ethical, social and legal concerns about certain treatments, such as gene therapy, could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting sale of our products.\nIn the United States, third-party payers, including government payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered and reimbursed. Expensive specialty drugs in particular are often subject to restriction. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payers and government payers develop their coverage and reimbursement policies. We cannot be assured that Medicare or Medicaid will cover our product candidates that may be approved or provide reimbursement without restriction and at adequate levels to realize a sufficient return on our investment. Our rebate payments may increase or our prices be adjusted under value-based purchasing arrangements based on evidence-based measures or outcomes-based measures for a patient or beneficiary based on use of our drug. Moreover, reimbursement agencies in the EU may be more conservative than CMS. It is difficult to predict what third-party payers will decide with respect to the coverage \n\n\n71\n\n\n\nand reimbursement for our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Additionally, within Europe, each country has its own reimbursement regime employing various health technology assessment approaches to assess the cost-effectiveness of the product (for example, in the United Kingdom a HTA assessment is conducted by NICE) which may significantly affect the effective access to the market.\nOur ability to negotiate, secure and maintain third-party coverage and reimbursement may also be affected by political, economic and regulatory developments. Governments continue to impose cost containment measures, and third-party payors are increasingly challenging prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness, in addition to their safety and efficacy. These and other similar developments could significantly limit the degree of market acceptance of our products or any of our other product candidates that receive marketing authorization.\nIf we are unable to establish or maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market, sell and distribute our products or product candidates, we may not be successful in our continuing efforts to commercialize our products or any other product candidate if and when they are approved.\nOur ongoing commercial strategy for our products and any other product candidate that may receive marketing authorization involves the development of a commercial infrastructure that spans multiple jurisdictions and is heavily dependent upon our ability to continue to build an infrastructure that is capable of implementing our global commercial strategy. The establishment and development of our commercial infrastructure will continue to be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to develop our commercial organizations in all intended territories, including in the United States, in a timely manner or at all. Doing so will require a high degree of coordination and compliance with laws and regulations in numerous territories, including restrictions on advertising practices, enforcement of intellectual property rights, restrictions on pricing or discounts, transparency laws and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs. If we are unable to effectively coordinate such activities or comply with such laws and regulations, our ability to commercialize our products or any other product candidates that may receive marketing authorization will be adversely affected. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue consistent with our expectations and may not become profitable.\nThere are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training an internal commercial team is expensive and time consuming and could delay commercialization efforts. If a commercial launch for any product or product candidate for which we recruit a commercial team and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition such personnel.\nThe arrangements that we have entered into, or may enter into, with third parties to perform sales and marketing services will generate lower product revenues or profitability of product revenues to us than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.\nIf we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products or product candidates. Factors that may materially affect our efforts to commercialize our products include:\n\n●   our ability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to monitor the legal and regulatory compliance of sales and marketing personnel;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   an inability to secure adequate coverage and reimbursement by government and private health plans;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   reduced realization on government sales from mandatory discounts, rebates and fees, and from price concessions to private health plans and pharmacy benefit managers necessitated by competition for access to managed formularies;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the clinical indications for which the products are approved and the claims that we may make for the products;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n72\n\n\n\n\n●   limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the products’ approved labeling;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   any distribution and use restrictions imposed by the FDA or to which we agree as part of a mandatory REMS or voluntary risk management plan;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   liability for sales or marketing personnel who fail to comply with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to implement third-party marketing and distribution relationships on favorable terms, or at all, in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the ability of our commercial team to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our current or any future products;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the lack of complementary products to be offered by our commercial team, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent commercial organization.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAny of these factors, individually or as a group, if not resolved in a favorable manner may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Similar risks apply in those territories where any of our products are available on a reimbursed basis under an EAP program.\nA substantial portion of our commercial sales currently occurs in territories outside of the United States which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe commercialize Translarna, Upstaza, Tegsedi and Waylivra outside of the United States. We have operations in multiple European countries, Latin America and other territories. We expect that we will continue to expand our international operations in the future, including in emerging growth markets, pending successful completion of the applicable regulatory processes. International operations inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\n●   political, regulatory, compliance and economic developments that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions that have been imposed by various countries in response thereto;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, potentially high inflation rates, sustained high interest rates and exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   difficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   unexpected changes in healthcare policies of ex-U.S. jurisdictions;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   trade protection measures, including import or export licensing requirements and tariffs;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   political and economic instability in particular ex-U.S. economies and markets, in particular in emerging markets, for example in Brazil;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the United States;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   differing labor regulations and business practices;\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ and service providers’ activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act or similar local regulation; and\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   various effects and responsive measures relating to outbreaks of contagious disease.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor example, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has previously experienced significant administrative delays processing centralized group purchase orders. Almost all of our product revenue for Translarna in Brazil is attributable to such purchase orders. These centralized group purchase order delays have caused, and may continue to cause, fluctuations in our ability to generate revenue in Brazil.\nIn addition, some countries in which a product candidate is not approved allow patients access to the product candidate through other legal mechanisms, including court intervention or EAP programs, if the product is approved in another jurisdiction. The price that is ultimately approved by governmental authorities in any country pursuant to commercial \n\n\n73\n\n\n\npricing and reimbursement processes may be significantly lower than the price we are able to charge for sales under such legal mechanisms and we may become obligated to repay such excess amount. \nSome of the countries in which our products are available for sale are in emerging markets. Some countries within emerging markets, including those in Latin America, may be especially vulnerable to periods of global or regional financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on. We also may be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents within less developed markets. In addition, many emerging market countries have currencies that fluctuate substantially and if such currencies devalue and we cannot offset the devaluations, our financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, in some countries, including Brazil and Russia, orders for named patient sales may be for multiple months of therapy, which can lead to an unevenness in orders which could result in significant fluctuations in quarterly net product sales. Other factors may also contribute to fluctuations in quarterly net product sales including a product’s availability in any particular territory, government actions, economic pressures, political unrest and other factors. Net product sales are impacted by factors such as the timing of decisions by regulatory authorities and our ability to successfully negotiate favorable pricing and reimbursement processes on a timely basis in the countries in which we have or may obtain regulatory approval, including the United States, EEA and other territories.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As we continue to expand our existing international operations, we may encounter new risks.\nLaws and regulations governing export restrictions and economic sanctions may preclude us from developing and selling certain products, generating revenue from such products, and manufacturing certain materials outside of the United States.\nMany countries, including the United States, restrict the export or import of products to or from certain countries through, for example, bans, sanction programs, and boycotts. Such restrictions may preclude us from supplying products or generating revenue in certain countries or may require an export license prior to the export of the controlled item. Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. Furthermore, if we, or third parties acting on our behalf, do not comply with these restrictions, we may be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. \nOur activities outside of the United States, require that we dedicate resources to comply with these laws. Many of our customers and suppliers are ex-U.S. entities or have significant ex-U.S. operations. Although these restrictions have not affected our operations in the past, there is a risk that they could do so in the future as additional geographic regions and entities may become subject to such restrictions. The imposition of new or additional economic and trade sanctions against our major customers or suppliers or financial counterparties or intermediaries could result in our inability to sell to, and generate revenue from such customers or purchase materials from such suppliers. For example, we make sales of Translarna through a distributor to the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation to access Russian nmDMD patients. Our ability to generate and realize revenue in Russia may be materially and adversely impacted as many countries, including the United States, have imposed and may continue to consider imposing additional enhanced export controls on certain products and sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia in connection with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We also contract with government-owned hospitals and third-party manufacturers located in China, which has recently been involved in political conflict with the United States. This conflict has increased the likelihood of restrictions that could materially and adversely affect our clinical trial sites located in China, our ability to obtain certain supplies, our ability to manufacture certain product candidates and our ability to potentially commercialize products in China. If our activities are affected because of these or other such restrictions, sanctions, or controls, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result of restrictive export laws, our customers may also seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n74\n\n\n\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current products and product candidates and any products we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Other gene therapy companies may in the future decide to utilize existing technologies to address unmet needs that could potentially compete with our product candidates.\nThere is currently no marketed therapy specifically for nmDMD, other than Translarna in the EEA. Santhera Pharmaceuticals has received approval of Agramee (vamorolone) in the United States for DMD patients ages 2 and up and in the EU and United Kingdom for patients ages 4 years and older. Sarepta Therapeutics has received approval of Elevidys for DMD patients 4 to 5 years of age with a confirmed mutation in the “DMD gene” in the United States and United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Sarepta Therapeutics has also received approval in the United States for two treatments (Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) and Vyondys 53 (golodirsen)) addressing the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene. Additionally, the FDA granted accelerated approval to Viltepso (viltolarsen) from NS Pharma for the treatment of DMD in patients with exon 53 skipping and Sarepta (Casimersen (SRP 4045) for the treatment of DMD in patients with exon 45 skipping. Viltepso (viltolarsen) from NS Pharma is also approved in Japan. Other biopharmaceutical companies are developing treatments addressing the underlying cause of disease for different mutations in the DMD gene, including, Dyne Therapeutics (DYNE-251), Wave Life Sciences (WVE-N53), Daiichi Sankyo (DS 5141)), Nippon Shinyaku (Viltolarsen (NS 065/NCNP 01) and NS 089/NCNP 02)), and Astellas (AT 702). Additionally, other pharmaceutical companies are developing micro dystrophin gene therapies for patients with DMD regardless of genotype, including Pfizer (PF 06939926) and Solid Biosciences (SGT 001).\nWith the expiration of Emflaza’s orphan exclusivity for treatment of DMD in patients five years and older in February 2024, we face competition from generic versions of Emflaza for this indication. Although the FDA has not approved a corticosteroid specifically for DMD in the United States other than Emflaza, we face competition in the United States in the DMD market from prednisone/prednisolone, which, while not approved for DMD in the United States, is generically available and has been prescribed off label for DMD patients. Santhera has received approval of Agramee (vamorolone), in the United States for DMD patients ages 2 and up and in the European Union and United Kingdom for patients ages 4 years and older.\nCurrently, no other treatment options are available for the underlying cause of AADC deficiency. Additionally, we are not aware of any late-stage development product candidates for AADC deficiency.\nThere are several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in the development or commercialization of products against targets that are also targets of Tegsedi and Waylivra. For example, Ionis is developing Olezarsen for the treatment of FCS. Additionally, Waylivra faces competition from Myalept (metreleptin) produced by Chesi Farmaceutica, Inc., which is currently approved in Brazil for use in generalized lipodystrophy patients. Tegsedi faces competition from drugs like Onpattro (patisiran) which was launched by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals in the United States in 2018 and received approval in Brazil for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in 2020 as was well as AMVUTTRA (vutrisiran) which Alnylam Pharmaceuticals received approval for in the United States and Brazil in 2022 for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults. Vyndaqel (tafamids meglumine) and Vyndamax (tafamidis) are commercialized in the United States, EU and some countries in Latin America by Pfizer. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of ATTR Amyloidosis with polyneuropathy including BridgeBio Pharma (AG 10), Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA2001), Proclara Biosciences (NPT 189) and SOM Biotech (tolcapone). For Waylivra, Ionis is developing Olezarsen for the treatment of FCS. Waylivra also faces competition from Myalept, (metreleptin) produced by Cheisi Farmaceutica, Inc., currently approved in Brazil for use in generalized lipodystrophy patients. \nEvrysdi, an orally bioavailable treatment, faces competition from treatments that are not orally bioavailable, including Spinraza (nusinersen), a drug developed by Ionis and marketed by Biogen, which is approved to treat SMA and Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec), a gene therapy drug developed by AveXis, Inc., (acquired by Novartis in 2018), which is approved in the United States and Japan for the treatment of SMA in patients under 2 years of age and in Europe for babies and young children who weigh up to 21 kilograms. Novartis is also developing OAV-101, an intrathecal administration of \n\n\n75\n\n\n\nZolgensma, for SMA patients ages ≥ 2 to < 18 years of age. Biogen is developing a higher dose regimen of nusinersen with potential for improved efficacy and evaluating an implantable medical device to enable subcutaneous delivery of nusinersen. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of SMA, including Scholar Rock (apitegromab, SRK-015), Biohaven (Taldefgrobep alfa), Roche Pharmaceuticals (RO-7204239/GYM-329), Biogen / Ionis (BIIB-115/ION-306) and NMD Pharma (NMD-670).\nIf approved, sepiapterin could face competition from Kuvan (sapropterin dihydrochloride), including generic versions, and Palynziq (pegvaliase-pqpz), each of which is approved for the treatment of PKU. Other companies are also pursuing product candidates for the treatment of PKU, including Otsuka Pharmaceutical (JNT-517), SOM Biotech (SOM-1311), Maze Therapeutics (MZE-782) and Agios (AG-181).\nIf approved, vatiquinone could face competition from Skyclarys (omaveloxolone) from Biogen, which is approved in the United States and the EU. There are also two assets in early development: LX-2006 (Lexeo/Frataxin AAVrh10) and CTI-1601 (Larimar Therapeutics).\nFor additional discussion regarding the competition we face with respect to our current product candidates, see “Item 1. Business-Competition.”\nOur competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are marketing or developing or that would render our products or product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain marketing authorization for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products and product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nWe believe that many competitors are attempting to develop therapeutics for the target indications of our products and product candidates, including academic institutions, government agencies, public and private research organizations, large pharmaceutical companies and smaller more focused companies.\nMany of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs.\nOur products or product candidates may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nWe may not obtain adequate coverage or reimbursement for our products, or we may be required to sell our products at an unsatisfactory price. In addition, obtaining pricing, coverage and reimbursement approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive these approvals on a timely basis.\nThe regulations and practices that govern marketing authorizations, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries, including almost all of the member states of the EEA, require approval of the sale (list) price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some ex-U.S. markets, including the European market, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing authorization for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations, in some countries at national as well as regional levels, that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the \n\n\n76\n\n\n\nrevenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more products or other product candidates, even following marketing authorization.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products or product candidates that may receive marketing authorization will depend in large part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, managed healthcare organizations and other third-party payors and organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and managed healthcare organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement conditions and rates. A primary trend in the EU and U.S. healthcare industries and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities, including the United States government and state legislatures, and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Prices at which our products are reimbursed can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with discounts off the products’ sale (list) prices and are challenging the prices manufacturers charge for medical products. We cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product or product candidate that we may commercialize and, if coverage is available, the level of reimbursement is also uncertain.\nReimbursement levels may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product or product candidate for which we obtain marketing authorization. Obtaining reimbursement for our products has been and is expected to continue to be, particularly difficult due to price considerations typically associated with drugs that are developed to treat conditions that affect a small population of patients. In addition, third-party payors are likely to impose strict requirements for reimbursement of a higher priced drug, such as prior authorization and the requirement to try other therapies first (i.e., step edits), or high co-payments which can result in patient rejection. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for a product or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover a product could reduce physician usage of the product. If reimbursement is not available or is available only on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product or product candidate for which we have obtained or may obtain marketing authorization.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the drug’s approved indications as determined by the applicable regulatory authority. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent, and programs intended to provide patient assistance until coverage is established can be very costly and limited in duration by law. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs, and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Further, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nNet prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws, enforcement policies or administrative determinations with respect to the importation of drugs into the United States from other countries where they may be sold at lower prices.\nIn the United States, third-party payors include federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Veterans Health Administration programs; managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Several of the U.S. federal healthcare programs establish ceiling prices or require that drug manufacturers extend discounts or pay rebates to certain programs in order for their products to be covered and reimbursed. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of covered outpatient drugs to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the federal government as a condition for coverage of the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drug(s) by state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is based on a statutory formula and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. State Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care plans can seek additional “supplemental” rebates from manufacturers in connection with states’ establishment of preferred drug lists. A further requirement for Medicaid coverage is that manufacturers of single source \n\n\n77\n\n\n\nand innovator multiple source drugs enter into a Master agreement and Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, agreement with the Secretary for Veterans Affairs and charge no more than statutory ceiling prices to the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Department of Defense and certain other federal agencies.\nSimilarly, in order for a covered outpatient drug to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs, the manufacturer must extend discounts on the covered outpatient drug to entities that are enrolled and participating in the 340B drug pricing program, which is a federal program that requires manufacturers to provide discounts to certain statutorily-defined safety-net providers. The 340B discount for each product is calculated based on certain Medicaid Drug Rebate Program metrics that manufacturers are required to report to CMS.\nEmflaza is also eligible for reimbursement under the Medicare Part D program. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D prescription drug formularies are required to include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain, and payment of Medicare Coverage Gap discounts may further reduce realization on Part D drugs. Further, CMS is proposing to relax Part D coverage requirements to give plans more leverage in negotiating their formularies.\nWith respect to drugs eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B, on November 27, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing a Most Favored Nations payment model under which reimbursement for certain Medicare Part B drugs and biologicals will be based on a price that reflects the lowest per capita Gross Domestic Product-adjusted (GDP-adjusted) price of any non-U.S. member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) with a GDP per capita that is at least sixty percent of the U.S. GDP per capita. This rule now has been rescinded but other measures, including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, have been enacted to address the costs of pharmaceuticals. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires manufacturers of selected drugs to negotiate discounted prices with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Failure to reach an agreement can subject manufacturers to an excise tax or withdraw of all drug products from coverage under Medicare and Medicaid. Drug price negotiations and other program implementation measures could potentially be affected by the Executive Order, Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions, issued on January 20, 2025 and/or the anticipated change in leadership at Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under the new administration. Such rules and any additional healthcare reform measures could further constrain our business or limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in additional pricing pressures.\nIn addition, U.S. private health insurers often rely upon Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. Any such coverage or payment limitations may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. Payment by private payors is also subject to payor-determined coverage and reimbursement policies that vary considerably and are subject to change without notice. We expect that coverage and reimbursement of Emflaza in the United States will vary from commercial payor to commercial payor. Many commercial payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to prescription drugs partly to control costs to their plans, and may use drug formularies and medical policies to limit their exposure. Exclusion from policies can directly reduce product usage in the payor’s patient population and may negatively impact utilization in other payor plans, as well.\nThere has been recent negative publicity and increasing legislative and public scrutiny around pharmaceutical drug pricing in the U.S., in particular with respect to orphan drugs and specifically with respect to Emflaza. Moreover, U.S. government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate drug prices and reimbursement, often with particular focus on orphan drugs. For example, certain drugs with an orphan designation may become subject to price negotiations under the IRA. These dynamics may give rise to heightened attention and potential negative reactions to pricing decisions for Emflaza and products for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future, possibly limiting our ability to generate revenue and attain profitability.\nMoreover, in 2017, the U.S. Congress modified and amended certain provisions of the 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, known collectively as the Affordable Care Act), which could have an impact on coverage and \n\n\n78\n\n\n\nreimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by the federal and state healthcare programs as well as plans in the private health insurance market. The so-called “individual mandate” was repealed as part of tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017. Legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act continue to arise and there may be future efforts to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. We cannot assure that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nAdditionally, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. Failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to reach required deficit reduction goals triggered the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This legislation resulted in aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031. However, pursuant to the CARES Act and subsequent legislation, these Medicare sequester reductions were suspended through the end of March 2022 and from April 2022 through June 2022, a 1% cut was in effect, with the full 2% cut remaining thereafter. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidates is prescribed or used.\nIn the EU, reference pricing systems and other measures may lead to cost containment and reduced prices with respect to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency and other product candidates that might receive marketing authorization in the future. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for our product or any of our product candidates that may receive marketing authorization, or a reduction in coverage for payment rates for our product or any such product candidates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in the EU, an authorized trader, such as a wholesaler, can purchase a medicine in one EU member state and obtain a license to import the product into another EU member state. This process is called “parallel distribution”. As a result, a purchaser in one EU member state may seek to import Translarna from another EU member state where Translarna is sold at a lower price. This could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth.\nSimilarly, sales of Emflaza or our other products in the United States could also be reduced if they, or products similar to them, are imported into the United States from lower-priced markets, whether legally or illegally. For example, in the United States, prices for pharmaceuticals are generally higher than in the bordering nations of Mexico and Canada. In October 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. Certain states have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada with the intent of developing SIPs for review and approval by the FDA. Florida received approval for its SIP from the FDA. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The effective date of the new safe harbors and the revision to the discount safe harbor was delayed by court order until January 1, 2023. Recent legislation further delayed implementation of the new safe harbors and the revision to the discount safe harbor until January 1, 2032.\nThere may be future changes in legal and regulatory requirements that may materially impact our results of operation.\nFuture changes in legal and regulatory requirements may introduce new risks into our operations and future prospects, which we are not able to currently anticipate. By example, changes taking place in the United States associated with a new federal administration, as well as changes in legal standards, including the reduced level of judicial deference due to administrative agencies following a 2024 Supreme Court decision, may introduce uncertainties with respect to our current and future operations and our future likelihood of success. It is possible that new federal or state laws or regulations may be passed, or laws and regulations may be enforced differently than they were before, which may expose us to additional \n\n\n79\n\n\n\nlegal and regulatory risk or uncertainty and require the expenditure of additional resources to ensure that we are able to comply. Such actions could also adversely restrict our business and operations. There could also be changes in the FDA’s approval standards that could impact our ability to obtain product approval and market our product candidates within the currently anticipated timeframes or otherwise impact the competitive market for our product candidates. Such changes may necessitate the conduct of additional development work, including preclinical and clinical trials, and manufacturing development. By example, for products intended for rare and serious diseases with unmet medical needs, the FDA is authorized to exercise regulatory flexibility when making a medical risk-benefit judgment. It is possible that whether and how the FDA exercises any regulatory flexibility, including with respect to specialized pathways, such as accelerated approval, may change, which could impact our ability to obtain product approval. Further, legal and regulatory changes may impact how we may market and sell our products in the future, if they are approved, as well as how they are reimbursed. Moreover, there could be changes in the federal workforce and agency policies that may result in regulatory delays, including with respect to the FDA’s review of marketing applications and other submissions, and that may impact the ability to communicate with and obtain guidance from the agencies. At this time, it is too early to predict the exact nature of any changes that may take place or whether and how they may impact our business and results of operation.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and based on our current commercial, research and development plans, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future. We may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $3,646.9 million. We have financed our operations to date primarily through the private offerings of convertible senior notes, public and “at the market offerings” of common stock, proceeds from royalty purchase agreements, net proceeds from our borrowing under our credit agreement with Blackstone, private placements of our convertible preferred stock and common stock, collaborations, bank and institutional lender debt, other convertible debt, grant funding and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease area addressed by our product candidates. We have relied on revenue generated from net sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories outside of the United States since 2014, Emflaza for the treatment of DMD in the United States since 2017, and Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA since May 2022. We have also relied on revenue associated with milestone and royalty payments from Roche pursuant to the SMA License Agreement under our SMA program and revenue generated from net sales of Tegsedi and Waylivra in Latin America and the Caribbean. Based on our current commercial, research and development plans, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future, which we anticipate will be partially offset by revenues generated from the sale of our products and our collaboration and royalty revenues. We expect to continue to generate operating losses through 2025 and, while we anticipate that operating losses generated in future periods should decline versus prior periods, we may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nFrom time to time, we have engaged in strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product pipeline, including through the acquisition of assets or businesses. In connection with these acquisitions, we have entered into agreements through which we have ongoing obligations, including obligations to make contingent payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and net sales milestones or upon a percentage of net sales of certain products. See “Item 1. Business-Our Ongoing Acquisition-Related Obligations” for further information regarding our acquisitions and our ongoing obligations. We may engage in additional strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product pipeline, including through the acquisition of assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or through strategic alliances or collaborations and we may incur expenses, including with respect to transaction costs, subsequent development costs or any upfront, milestone or other payments or other financial obligations associated with any such transaction.\nOur current ability to generate revenue from sales of Translarna is dependent upon our ability to maintain our marketing authorizations in the EEA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients aged two years and older, in Russia for the treatment of nmDMD in patients aged two years and older and in Brazil for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory patients two years and older and for continued treatment of patients that become non-ambulatory, as well as in various other countries. The marketing authorization in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the EC \n\n\n80\n\n\n\nfollowing reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization. For example, in February 2023, we submitted an annual marketing authorization request to the EMA. In September 2023, the CHMP gave a negative opinion on the conversion of the conditional marketing authorization to the full marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and a negative opinion on the renewal of the existing conditional marketing authorization of Translarna. In January 2024, the CHMP issued a negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure. In May 2024, the EC decided not to adopt the CHMP’s negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna and returned such opinion to the CHMP for re-evaluation. In June 2024, following the EC’s request for re-review, the CHMP issued a negative opinion on the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. On October 18, 2024, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following the requested reexamination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the EC has 67 days from the date of issuance to adopt the opinion. At this time, the EC has not yet adopted the negative opinion. If the EC adopts the negative opinion, Translarna would no longer have marketing authorization in the member states of the EEA. For more information regarding the risks associated with a potential EC adoption of the CHMP’s negative opinion on Translarna’s marketing authorization, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, “We may be unable to continue to commercialize Translarna for nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the European Economic Area if the European Commission nmDMD in the EEA if the EC adopts the negative opinion issued by the CHMP for the renewal of the existing conditional authorization for Translarna.” We also expect that our efforts to advance Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States will be time-consuming and may be expensive. In October 2024, the FDA accepted for review the resubmission of the NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. As this was an NDA resubmission following a CRL to the NDA which was filed over protest in 2016, the FDA is not obligated to follow the review timelines under PDUFA guidelines and an action date has not been provided.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with our commercialization efforts in the United States, the EEA, Latin America and other territories, including expenses related to our commercial infrastructure and corresponding sales and marketing, legal and regulatory, and distribution and manufacturing undertakings as well as administrative and employee-based expenses. In addition to the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in connection with ongoing, planned and potential future clinical trials and studies for sepiapterin and our splicing and inflammation and ferroptosis programs as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications. We continue to seek marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in territories that we do not currently have marketing authorization in and we are exploring other potential mechanisms by which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA if the EC adopts the CHMP’s negative opinion for Translarna. We also submitted an MAA to the EMA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in March 2024, an NDA to the FDA for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in the third quarter of 2024, and an NDA to the FDA for vatiquinone for the treatment of FA in the fourth quarter of 2024. These efforts may significantly impact the timing and extent of our commercialization and manufacturing expenses.\nIn addition, the clinical and regulatory developments noted in this risk factor may exacerbate the risks related to our commercialization efforts set forth under the heading “Risks Related to the Development and Commercialization of our Products and our Product Candidates,” which could increase the costs associated with our commercial activities or have a negative impact on our revenues.\nWe may seek to continue to expand and diversify our product pipeline through opportunistically in-licensing or acquiring the rights to products, product candidates or technologies and we may incur expenses, including with respect to transaction costs, subsequent development costs or any upfront, milestone or other payments or other financial obligations associated with any such transaction, which would increase our future capital requirements.\n\nWith respect to our outstanding 1.50% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2026, or the 2026 Convertible Notes, cash interest payments are payable on a semi-annual basis in arrears, which will require total funding of $4.3 million annually. \nWe expect to make payments to the former Censa securityholders of $57.5 million in the aggregate in cash upon the potential achievement in 2025 of regulatory milestones relating to sepiapterin pursuant to the Censa Merger Agreement.\n\n\n81\n\n\n\nUpon the potential achievement in 2025 of certain regulatory milestones relating to vatiquinone, which milestones would be payable in 2026, we expect to make payments to BioElectron of $75.0 million in the aggregate, in cash or shares of our common stock, as determined by us.\nIn addition, our expenses will increase if and as we:\n\n●   seek to satisfy contractual and regulatory obligations that we assumed through our acquisitions and collaborations;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   execute our commercialization strategy for our products, including initial commercialization launches of our products, label extensions or entering new markets;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   are required to complete any additional clinical trials, non-clinical studies or Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC, assessments or analyses in order to advance our products or product candidates in the United States or elsewhere;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   are required to take other steps to maintain our current marketing authorization in the EEA, Brazil and Russia for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or to obtain further marketing authorizations for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or other indications;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   initiate or continue the research and development of sepiapterin and our splicing and inflammation and ferroptosis programs as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   seek to expand and diversify our product pipeline through strategic transactions;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur expenses may also increase as a result of economic conditions, such as potentially high inflation rates within the jurisdictions that we operate, sustained high interest rates, or unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur ability to generate profits from operations and become and remain profitable depends on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize drugs that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:\n\n●   commercializing and marketing all of our products and products candidates;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   negotiating, securing, and maintaining adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement terms, on a timely basis, with third-party payors for our products and product candidates;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   maintaining our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA following the CHMP’s negative opinion on the conditional marketing authorization and the EC’s potential adoption of the negative opinion;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   advancing Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   successfully completing any post-marketing requirements imposed by regulatory agencies with respect to our products;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   expanding the territories in which we are approved to market our products;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   successfully advancing our other programs and collaborations, including sepiapterin and our splicing and inflammation and ferroptosis programs as well as studies in our products for additional indications;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   maintaining a global commercial infrastructure, including the sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to effectively market and sell our products and product candidates throughout the world;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   implementing marketing and distribution relationships with third parties in territories where we do not pursue direct commercialization;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   identifying patients eligible for treatment with our products and product candidates;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   successfully developing or commercializing any product candidate or product that we may in-license or acquire;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   protecting our rights to our intellectual property portfolio related to Translarna and other products and product candidates; and\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   contracting for the manufacture and distribution of commercial quantities of our products and product candidates.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n82\n\n\n\nWe may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant enough to generate profits from operations. Even if we do generate profits from operations, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to generate profits from operations and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in our company.\nWe may need additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nAs noted in the prior risk factor, we expect to incur significant expenses related to our clinical, regulatory, commercial, legal, research and development, and other business efforts. We believe that our cash flows from product sales, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\n●   our ability to maintain our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA following the CHMP’s negative opinion on the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure and the EC’s potential adoption of the negative opinion, or to identify other potential mechanisms in which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to maintain the marketing authorization for Translarna and our other products in territories outside of the EEA;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to commercialize and market our products and product candidates that may receive marketing authorization;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to negotiate, secure and maintain adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement terms, on a timely basis, with third-party payors for our products and products candidates;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the amount of generic drug competition that we face for Emflaza following its loss of orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to obtain marketing authorization for sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU in the United States and EEA;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to obtain marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the United States;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to obtain marketing authorization for vatiquinone for the treatment of FA in the United States;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   unexpected decreases in revenue or increase in expenses resulting from potential widespread outbreaks of contagious disease;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to successfully complete all post-marketing requirements imposed by regulatory agencies with respect to our products;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the progress and results of activities for sepiapterin and our splicing and inflammation and ferroptosis programs as well as studies in our products for maintaining authorizations, label extensions and additional indications;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the scope, costs and timing of our commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, legal, regulatory, distribution and manufacturing, for any of our products and for any of our other product candidates that may receive marketing authorization or any additional territories in which we receive authorization to market Translarna;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of sepiapterin and our splicing and inflammation and ferroptosis programs and Translarna and Upstaza in other territories;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to satisfy our obligations under the indenture governing the 2026 Convertible Notes;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the timing and scope of any potential future growth in our employee base;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other product candidates, including those in our splicing and inflammation and ferroptosis programs;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   revenue received from commercial sales of our products or any of our product candidates;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to obtain additional and maintain existing reimbursed named patient and cohort EAP programs for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD on adequate terms, or at all;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n83\n\n\n\n\n●   the ability and willingness of patients and healthcare professionals to access Translarna through alternative means if pricing and reimbursement negotiations in the applicable territory do not have a positive outcome;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property-related claims;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products, product candidates, and technologies, including the success of any acquisition, in-licensing or other strategic transaction we may pursue, and the costs of subsequent development requirements and commercialization efforts, including with respect to our acquisitions of Emflaza, Agilis, our inflammation and ferroptosis platform and Censa and our licensing of Tegsedi and Waylivra; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to establish and maintain collaborations, including our collaborations with Roche, the SMA Foundation and our collaboration with Novartis, and our ability to obtain research funding and achieve milestones under these agreements.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales for certain product candidates or indications. In addition, our products and product candidates, if approved, may not achieve sustained commercial success. Likewise, if we fail to maintain our marketing authorization or lose non-patent market exclusivity for our products and product candidates, we will be unable to commercialize and generate revenue from the sales of those products.\nAccordingly, we may need to continue to rely on additional financing in connection with our continuing operations and to achieve our business objectives. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or based on strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions to acquire assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders’ ownership, increase our debt, or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may engage in additional strategic transactions to expand and diversify our product pipeline, including through the acquisition of assets, businesses, or rights to products, product candidates or technologies or through strategic alliances or collaborations, similar to our acquisitions of Emflaza, Agilis, Censa and BioElectron’s assets and the Tegsedi-Waylivra Agreement. We may not identify suitable strategic transactions, or complete such transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential opportunities that are never completed, or we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of such opportunities. Even if we successfully execute a strategic transaction, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction, may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith, and may experience losses related to our investments in such transactions. Integration of an acquired company or assets into our existing business may not be successful and may disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. Even if we are able to achieve the long-term benefits of a strategic transaction, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity. Any of the foregoing could have a detrimental effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, future strategic transactions may entail numerous operational, financial and legal risks, including:\n\n●   incurrence of substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   exposure to known and unknown liabilities, including possible intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, tax liabilities and commercial disputes;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   difficulty in integrating operations and personnel of any acquired business;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n84\n\n\n\n\n●   increased amortization expenses or, in the event that we write-down the value of acquired assets, impairment losses;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   inability to retain personnel, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners integral to an in-licensed or acquired product, product candidate or technology;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   entry into indications or markets in which we have no or limited direct prior development or commercial experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; and\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   other challenges associated with managing an increasingly diversified business.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf we are unable to successfully manage any strategic transaction in which we may engage, our ability to develop new products and continue to expand and diversify our product pipeline may be limited.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate enough product revenues to cover our expenses, we expect to supplement our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, royalty sales, collaborations, strategic alliances, grants and clinical trial support from governmental and philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups in the disease areas addressed by our product candidates; marketing, distribution, licensing or other arrangements.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders’ ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Any debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, entering into agreements involving licenses to our intellectual property, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates; or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes to offset potential taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is subject to limitation under the provisions of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code as a result of ownership changes of the Company and could be subject to further annual limitations under such provisions. In addition, we may not generate sufficient future taxable income to use our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes.\nIf a corporation undergoes an “ownership change” within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Sections 382 and 383, the corporation’s ability to utilize any net operating losses, or NOLs, and certain tax credits and other tax attributes generated before such an ownership change, is limited. We believe that we have in the past experienced ownership changes within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 that have resulted in limitations under Sections 382 and 383 (and similar state provisions) on the use of our NOLs and other tax attributes.\nSections 382 and 383 are extremely complex provisions with respect to which there are many uncertainties, and we have not requested a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, to confirm our analysis of the ownership change limitations related to the NOLs and other tax attributes generated by us. Therefore, we have not established whether the IRS would agree with our analysis regarding the application of Sections 382 and 383. We continue to fully evaluate the impact of a limitation on the use of our NOLs and other tax attributes under Sections 382 and 383.\n\n\n85\n\n\n\nMoreover, our ability to use these NOLs to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income. We generated taxable income that is subject to income tax in 2024, but continue to maintain NOLs from previous years that will be carried forward.\nChanges in our effective income tax rates and future changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the Unites States and various ex-U.S. jurisdictions. Taxes will be incurred as income is earned in these different jurisdictions. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and rates, the accounting for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in accounting standards, future levels of research and development spending, changes in the mix and level of pre-tax earnings by taxing jurisdiction, the outcome of examinations by the IRS and other taxing authorities, the accuracy of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits, the realization of deferred tax assets, or changes to our ownership or capital structure. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above-mentioned factors and others may be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations, including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), may increase tax uncertainty and the amount of tax we pay.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States government enacted the 2017 Tax Act, which significantly reformed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. The Tax Act, among other things, contained significant changes to corporate taxation. As part of Congress’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, economic relief legislation was enacted in 2020 and 2021. Such legislation contains numerous tax provisions. In addition, the IRA was signed into law in August 2022. The IRA introduced new tax provisions, including a 1% excise tax imposed on certain stock repurchases by publicly traded corporations. The 1% excise tax generally applies to any acquisition by the publicly traded corporation (or certain of its affiliates) of stock of the publicly traded corporation in exchange for money or other property (other than stock of the corporation itself), subject to a de minimis exception. Thus, the excise tax could apply to certain transactions that are not traditional stock repurchases.\nRegulatory guidance under the 2017 Tax Act, the IRA, and such additional legislation is and continues to be forthcoming, and such guidance could ultimately increase or lessen the impact of these laws on our business and financial condition. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the 2017 Tax Act, the IRA, and additional tax legislation.\nAlthough we monitor actual and potential changes to the tax laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, it is very difficult to assess to what extent these changes may impact the way in which we conduct our business or our effective tax rate due to the unpredictability and interdependency of these changes. Changes in tax laws and related regulations and practices could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, cash flows, effective tax rate, financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of our Products and our Product Candidates\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our products or product candidates in either the United States or the EU. \nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the EU and the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. We have obtained orphan drug designations from the EMA and from the FDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD, Upstaza/Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC, Evrysdi for the treatment of SMA, sepiapterin for the treatment of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia, including hyperphenylalaninemia caused by PKU and vatiquinone for the treatment of FA. The FDA has also granted an orphan drug designation to Emflaza for the treatment of DMD. We may also seek orphan drug designation and exclusivity for other product candidates, if we believe that the product candidate may qualify. We, however, may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation in the future for \n\n\n86\n\n\n\nany of our other product candidates and, even if we obtain designation, we may ultimately not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity. Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity, both in the EU and in the United States, may be important to a product candidate’s future success.\nIn the EU, if an orphan designated product subsequently receives the first marketing authorization for the indication for which it has received such a designation, the product is entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the EMA from accepting another marketing application for a similar medicinal product, even if the new marketing application relies on independently generated data submitted as part of a full marketing authorization application dossier. The EU exclusivity period can be reduced to six years, at the end of the fifth year, if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, including if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. In addition, a competing similar medicinal product may in limited circumstances be authorized prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period, including if it is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan product. In this context, a “similar medicinal product” is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Product candidates can also lose orphan designation, and the related benefits, prior to obtaining a marketing authorization if it is demonstrated that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met. The EC has conducted a review of the Orphan Drug Regulation together with the Paediatric Regulation. The outcome of this review is intended to guide future legislative changes and shape the EU’s pharmaceutical strategy.\nIn the United States, under FDA’s current policy, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing authorization for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the “same drug” for the same orphan designated approved indication for that time period. When determining whether a drug is the “same drug” as an orphan designated product, the FDA looks to the products’ molecular features and use. The specific sameness criteria, however, varies based on whether the product is composed of small or large molecules and if the product is a gene therapy. Moreover, for gene therapies, the sameness criteria are currently evolving. For example, the FDA issued a final guidance document specific to sameness determinations. Depending on product characteristics, sameness may be determined by the FDA on a case-by-case basis, making it difficult to predict when FDA may approve a product and whether periods of exclusivity will effectively block competitors seeking to market products that are the same or similar to ours for the same intended use. Moreover, following the Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra and FDA’s subsequent statement that it intends to continue to apply its regulations tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, as further described in this filing, the exact scope of orphan drug exclusivity may be an evolving space. Accordingly, whether any of our products or product candidates will be deemed to be the same as another product or product candidate is uncertain and the scope of any potential or received orphan drug exclusivity period, as well as any of our competitors that may block approval of one of our product candidates, may be subject to revision.\nObtaining orphan drug designation does not guarantee that we will be able to receive ultimate marketing approval. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a product candidate nor gives the product candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. Moreover, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to multiple products that are considered to be the “same drug” for the same indication. If a competitor obtains an orphan drug designation for and approval of a product with orphan drug exclusivity for the same indication as one of our product candidates before we do and if the competitor’s product is the same drug, in the United States or a similar medicinal product, in the EU, as ours, we could be excluded from the market for a period of time.\nWe also may not be able to maintain any orphan drug designations or exclusivities. For instance, orphan drug designations may be revoked if the FDA finds that the request for designation contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted material information, or if the FDA finds that the product candidate was not eligible for designation at the time of the submission of the request. Even if we are able to receive and maintain orphan drug designations, we may ultimately not receive any period of regulatory exclusivity if our product candidates are approved. For instance, we may not receive orphan product regulatory exclusivity if the indication for which we receive FDA approval is broader than the orphan drug designation. Orphan exclusivity may also be lost for the same reasons that designation may be lost. Orphan exclusivity may further be lost if we are unable to assure a sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\n\n\n87\n\n\n\nFurther, even if we do receive orphan drug exclusivity upon approval of a product candidate, this exclusivity is not absolute. For example, if a competitive product that is the same drug or a similar medicinal product as one of our approved products with orphan exclusivity is shown to be “clinically superior” to our product candidate as determined by the FDA or EMA, respectively, any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product. Orphan exclusivity also would not block the FDA from approving a drug that is the same as our product candidates for different indications or products that are different from ours for the same indication. Moreover, marketing exclusivity would not prevent a provider from prescribing or using another drug off-label and third-party payors may reimburse for products off-label even if not indicated for the orphan condition.\nFor certain of our products, periods of orphan drug exclusivity are important. For instance, for Emflaza, we have previously relied on non-patent market exclusivity periods under the Orphan Drug Act to commercialize Emflaza in the United States. Emflaza’s seven-year period of orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older expired in February 2024. We expect the expiration of this orphan drug exclusivity to have significant negative impact on Emflaza net product revenue, as we face competition from generic versions of Emflaza for this indication, which are generally priced less than Emflaza. Emflaza’s orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients two years of age to less than five expires in June 2026. Healthcare providers may also substitute the generic version(s) of Emflaza for patients two years of age to five, despite the fact that the generic version(s) will not be approved for such indication until after June 2026.\nThe respective orphan designation and exclusivity frameworks in the United States and in the EU are subject to change, and any such changes may affect our ability to obtain, or the impact of obtaining, EU or United States orphan designations in the future.\nAll pharmaceutical products for which marketing authorization has been granted are subject to extensive and rigorous governmental regulation and could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market. We may also be subject to penalties or other enforcement if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved, as well as our product candidates during development.\nWe, our products and product candidates, our operations, our facilities, our suppliers and our contract manufacturers, distributors, contract research organizations, clinical trial sites and contract testing laboratories are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the EEA, the United States, and other territories, with regulations differing from country to country.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the EEA, the United States, or other territories until we have received requisite regulatory approvals. In order to receive and maintain such approvals, and to be compliant with regulatory authority requirements, we and our third-party service providers must comply on a continuous basis with a broad array of regulations and requirements. Depending on the stage of product development and whether a product is approved these requirements may relate to establishment registration and product listing, the payment of user fees, manufacturing processes, risk management measures, quality and pharmacovigilance systems (including reporting of manufacturing deviations and adverse events), pre- and post-approval clinical and pre-clinical data and study conduct, labeling, packaging, advertising, marketing and promotional activities (including product sampling), record keeping, distribution, storage, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Any regulatory approval of any of our products or product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn. For example, our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA is subject to annual review and renewal by the EC following reassessment by the EMA of the benefit-risk balance of the authorization, as well as the specific obligation to conduct and report the results of Study 041. In January 2024, the CHMP issued a negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure. In May 2024, the EC decided not to adopt the CHMP’s negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna and returned such opinion to the CHMP for re-evaluation. In June 2024, following the EC’s request for re-review, the CHMP issued a negative opinion on the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. On October 18, 2024, the CHMP maintained its negative opinion for the renewal of the conditional marketing authorization following the requested reexamination procedure. In accordance with EMA regulations, the EC has 67 days from the date of issuance to adopt the \n\n\n88\n\n\n\nopinion. At this time, the EC has not yet adopted the negative opinion. If the EC adopts the negative opinion, Translarna would no longer have marketing authorization in the member states of the EEA.\nAfter approving a drug, the FDA may withdraw product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. Requirements for additional clinical trials and studies to confirm safety and effectiveness may be imposed as a condition of marketing approval. In addition, the FDA requires surveillance programs to monitor approved products that have been commercialized, as well as REMS, and the agency has the power to require changes in labeling or to prevent further marketing and distribution of a product. For example, we were obligated to perform certain FDA post-marketing requirements in connection with our marketing authorization for Emflaza in the United States, including clinical safety studies. Additionally, our marketing authorizations for Translarna, Tegsedi and Waylivra in Brazil and our marketing authorization for Translarna in Russia are subject to renewal every five years. There is no guarantee that we will be able to complete our post-marketing obligations in accordance with the established timetables. Failure to complete the required studies in accordance with the established timetables or failure to provide the requisite periodic reports on the status of post-marketing studies in the absence of good cause could result in an enforcement action. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing and distribution.\nRegulatory authorities conduct ongoing reviews and inspections or remote regulatory assessments of marketed products, as well as sponsors and manufacturing facilities. Regulatory authorities also conduct inspections of manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites before approving a product, which can delay approval. If compliance issues are found, it could also result in refusal to approve marketing applications, disruption of production or distribution of a product or product candidate, disruption, cancellation, or suspension of a study, or require substantial resources to correct.\nEven if marketing authorization of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed, the product may have labeling that includes significant restrictions, warnings, including black box warnings, and contraindications, the regulatory authorities may not approve label claims necessary for successful product marketing, or the approval may be subject to significant conditions of approval, including the requirement of a REMS. A regulatory authority also may impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. In addition, the competent authorities of each EU member state and the FDA closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling and regulatory requirements. Such regulatory authorities can and do impose stringent restrictions on our communications regarding off-label use and if we do not comply with the laws governing promotion of approved drugs, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label promotion. For example, violations of the FDCA relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to civil and criminal penalties, investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, both before and after product approval, may yield various results which could negatively affect our business, including:\n\n●   restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes to or restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   modifications to promotional pieces;\n----------------------------------------\n\n●   issuance of corrective information;\n---------------------------------------\n\n●   clinical holds or termination of clinical trials;\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in the way a product is administered;\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n●   liability for harm caused to patients or subjects;\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   adverse publicity, reputational harm, or the product becoming less competitive;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   regulatory authority issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   restrictions on product distribution or use;\n------------------------------------------------\n\n●   requirements to implement a REMS;\n-------------------------------------\n89\n\n\n\n\n●   requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   warning, cyber or untitled letters;\n---------------------------------------\n\n●   withdrawal of the products from the market or marketing suspensions;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   recall of products;\n-----------------------\n\n●   fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   suspension or withdrawal of marketing authorizations;\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   product seizure or detention;\n---------------------------------\n\n●   injunctions;\n----------------\n\n●   the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n●   FDA debarment, suspension and debarment from government contracts, and refusal of orders under existing government contracts, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, consent decrees, or corporate integrity agreements.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNon-compliance with regulatory requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nNot only will we be responsible for our own conduct, but we will also be responsible for the conduct of our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, manufacturers, investigators, and contract research organizations. To the extent that any of these third parties engage in intentional, reckless, negligent, or unintentional failures to comply applicable legal and regulatory requirements, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement action, legal actions and liability, and serious harm to our reputation. Moreover, it is possible for a whistleblower to pursue a False Claims Act case against us as a result of such third-party conduct, even if the government considers the claim unmeritorious and declines to intervene, which could require us to incur costs defending against such a claim.\nAny of the above events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing such product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale. Any of these events could further have other material and adverse effects on our operations and business and could adversely impact our stock price and could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may face competition from biosimilar, generic, and similar products approved through abbreviated pathways, as well as products approved pursuant to full applications.\nOur approved products may face competition from products approved via abbreviated pathways as well as products approved pursuant to full applications. For example, our biologic products may face competition from biosimilar or interchangeable products. Sponsors seeking approval of biosimilar or interchangeable products to ours would reference our product in their applications. The applicable laws, however, establish certain protections for reference biologic products. For example, there is a complex and involved framework for sponsors to bring patent infringement actions and actions for declaratory judgment. Accordingly, we may need to pursue costly and time-consuming patent infringement actions, which may include certain statutorily specified regulatory steps before an infringement action may be brought. We may also need to spend time and money defending an action for declaratory judgement that is brought by the biosimilar product sponsor.\nAnother protection established for biologic products is a period of 12 years of exclusivity for reference products that begins on the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. During this time, the FDA may not make the licensure of a biosimilar product effective. Biosimilar applications can, however, be submitted for FDA review beginning four years after the date of the reference product’s first licensure. This exclusivity period, however, is subject to certain limitations. For example, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and certain subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the 12-year exclusivity \n\n\n90\n\n\n\nperiod. Moreover, there have been legislative efforts to decrease this period of exclusivity to a shorter timeframe. Future proposed budgets, international trade agreements and other arrangements or proposals may affect periods of exclusivity. Further, there is a risk that the FDA will not consider our biologic products to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Additionally, this period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet fully clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. It is also possible that payers will give reimbursement preference to biosimilars, even over reference biologics, absent a determination of interchangeability. Similarly, in the EU, another company could gain approval for a competing product based on an MAA with a completely independent data package that includes pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.\nFor small molecule drug products, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an ANDA seeking approval of a generic copy of one of our approved products. A manufacturer could also submit an NDA under section 505(b)(2), referencing the FDA’s finding of safety and efficacy for one of our drug products, while also conducting its own studies to support any product changes. Any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA products referencing our approved products would be required to submit patent certifications to the FDA. Unless the applicant does not seek approval until any of our Orange Book listed patents expire or, to the extent possible, carve out any of our Orange Book listed method of use patents, such an applicant would be required to submit what is known as a “Paragraph IV certification,” challenging the validity or enforceability of, or claiming non-infringement of, the listed patent or patents. This would provide us with an opportunity to sue to enforce our patents, which would stay any FDA approval for 30 months from the patent or application owner’s receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent is favorably decided in the applicant’s favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. While this would delay the approval of the generic or 505(b)(2) product, such actions would require significant time and cost.\nOur small molecule drug products may also be eligible for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity (e.g., five years for new chemical entities and three years for changes to an approved drug requiring a new clinical study), which preclude FDA approval (or in some circumstances, FDA filing and review of) an ANDA or 505(b) (2) NDA relying on the FDA’s finding of safety and effectiveness for the innovative drug. These exclusivities, however, are also subject to certain limitations. For instance, they would not block FDA acceptance and approval of full NDA applications.\nEven with the various protections in place, we may not be successful in securing or maintaining proprietary patent protection for our products and product candidates necessary to prevail should we need to bring any challenges under the above FDA regulatory structures. We may also not receive any anticipated periods of regulatory exclusivity. Competition that our products may face from biosimilar, interchangeable, generic, or 505(b)(2) NDA products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability, and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates. In the United States, this risk has increased in recent years as the FDA and the U.S. government have taken steps to encourage increased drug and biologic competition in the market, in an effort to bring down the cost of pharmaceutical products.\nCommercialization of Translarna and Upstaza has been in, and is expected to continue to take place in, countries that tend to impose strict price controls, which may adversely affect our revenues. Failure to obtain and maintain acceptable pricing and reimbursement terms for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency in the EEA and other countries where Translarna is available would delay or prevent us from marketing our product in such regions, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn some countries, particularly the member states of the EEA, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. Each country in the EEA has its own pricing and reimbursement regulations and may have other regulations related to the marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products in the country. We generally will not be able to commence commercial sales of Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD or Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency pursuant to the marketing authorization granted by the EC in any particular member state of the EEA until we conclude the applicable pricing and reimbursement negotiations and comply with any licensing, employment or related regulatory requirements in that country. In some countries we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies of our product, including trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product to other available therapies in \n\n\n91\n\n\n\norder to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. We may not be able to conclude pricing and reimbursement negotiations or comply with additional regulatory requirements in the countries in which we seek to commercialize Translarna or Upstaza on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe pricing and reimbursement process varies from country to country and can take a substantial amount of time from initiation to completion. Pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. We cannot predict the timing of Translarna’s or Upstaza’s commercial launch in countries where we are awaiting pricing and reimbursement guidelines. While we have submitted pricing and reimbursement dossiers with respect to Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD and Upstaza for the treatment of AADC deficiency in many EEA countries, we have only received both pricing and reimbursement approval on terms that are acceptable to us in a limited number of countries.\nThe price that is approved by governmental authorities in any country pursuant to commercial pricing and reimbursement processes may be significantly lower than the price we are able to charge for sales under our reimbursed EAP programs and various forms of national “market access agreements” may need to be entered into to achieve reimbursement. In some instances, reimbursement may be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payors.\nFor example, in France, EAP and commercial sales of a product can begin while pricing and reimbursement rates are under discussion with the applicable government health programs. In the event that the negotiated price of the product is lower than the amount reimbursed for sales made prior to the conclusion of price negotiations, we may become obligated to repay such excess amount to the applicable government health program. We will make such retroactive reimbursement, if any, following the conclusion of price negotiations with the applicable government health authority.\nFurther, based on unsustainable economics imposed by the arbitration board in Germany upon the conclusion of an arbitration process in 2016 with us and the German Federal Association of the Statutory Health Insurances, we delisted Translarna from the German pharmacy ordering system, effective April 1, 2016. While some patients and healthcare professionals in Germany have been able to access Translarna through a reimbursed importation pathway possible under German law, there can be no assurance that other patients or healthcare professionals in Germany will be successful doing so or, if initially successful, that any or all will continue to be successful. We were required to reimburse payors in Germany the difference between the commercial price of Translarna and the price established by the arbitration board in Germany for sales made in Germany after December 2015, other than sales made pursuant to the reimbursed importation pathway.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing and reimbursement negotiations and there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. In addition, adverse clinical and regulatory developments may exacerbate these risks.\nReference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices and revenues. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries.\nIf we fail to successfully secure and maintain pricing and reimbursement coverage for Translarna or Upstaza or are significantly delayed in doing so or if burdensome conditions are imposed by private payers, government authorities or other third-party payors on such reimbursement, planned launches in the affected countries will be delayed and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur relationships with customers, healthcare providers and professionals, patients, patient organizations, and third-party payors are or will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare professionals and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products or product candidates. Our arrangements with customers, healthcare professionals and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, transparency and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Failure to maintain a comprehensive and effective compliance program, and to \n\n\n92\n\n\n\nintegrate the operations of any acquired businesses into a combined comprehensive and effective compliance program on a timely basis, could result in business practices and operations that expose us to a range of regulatory actions that could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and could harm or prevent sales of the affected products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products.\nThere are numerous restrictions and reporting requirements under applicable U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, and equivalent laws and regulations in the EU and other countries in which we operate, as well as self-regulatory codes. Efforts to ensure that we and our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws, regulations, transparency requirements and self-regulatory codes have and will continue to involve substantial costs. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, our third-party contractors, or the healthcare professionals or entities with whom we expect to do business, are or will be in compliance with all federal, state and ex-U.S. regulations and codes. It is possible that governmental authorities could conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, reputational harm, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Exclusion, suspension and debarment from government funded healthcare, procurement and non-procurement programs would adversely affect, perhaps materially, our ability to commercialize, sell or distribute any drug. Even if we were not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant time and resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory changes affecting the pharmaceutical industry or the healthcare system more broadly may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain or maintain marketing authorization of and commercialize our products and product candidates and affect the coverage and reimbursement we may obtain.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations, or financial results. In the United States and some ex-U.S. jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing authorization of our products or product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any products or product candidates for which we have obtained, or may obtain, marketing authorization.\nCertain provisions of enacted or proposed legislative changes may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of healthcare items and services. For example, in the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act requires manufacturers to calculate and report a drug’s Average Sales Price used to reimburse providers for physician-administered drugs under Medicare Part B and changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and reimbursement that we receive for any approved products. While the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own policies. Therefore, any restrictions to coverage or reductions in reimbursement that result from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar coverage restriction or reimbursement reduction from private payors. In addition, private payors may implement coverage restrictions or payment reductions independently from federal programs such as Medicare.\nSimilarly, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products. However, legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act may contribute to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the Affordable Care Act and also underscore the potential for additional reform going forward. We cannot assure that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results.\nPromulgated and proposed regulatory changes could also affect coverage or reimbursement of our products and in 2016, CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program, which among other things, revises the manner in which the “average manufacturer price” is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid rebate statute created under the ACA. More recently, Congress amended the Medicaid statute, effective October 1, 2019, to exclude prices paid by secondary manufacturers for an authorized generic drug (but \n\n\n93\n\n\n\nnot a product approved under the BLA process) from the NDA holder’s AMP for the brand, thereby increasing the rebate amount and the 340B price for the brand. This was implemented by CMS in a final rule issued December 31, 2020. The rule also expanded the definition of products identified as “line extensions” and, in certain circumstances, required inclusion of patient copay assistance in Medicaid best price (effective January 1, 2023), thereby potentially increasing Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers for such drugs. 340B program guidance regulations on civil monetary penalties for statutory violations, which had been finalized in early 2017 but deferred, recently also went into effect.\nIn 2020, the Trump administration issued several executive orders intended to lower the costs of prescription products and certain provisions in these orders have been incorporated into regulations. These regulations include an interim final rule implementing a most favored nation model for prices that would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered pharmaceuticals to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. That rule, however, has been subject to a nationwide preliminary injunction and, on December 29, 2021, CMS issued a final rule to rescind it. With issuance of this rule, CMS stated that it will explore all options to incorporate value into payments for Medicare Part B pharmaceuticals and improve beneficiaries' access to evidence-based care.\n\nMore recently, on August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (negotiated prices for the first 10 selected drugs effective beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.\nSpecifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D effective starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least 9 years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition. Nonetheless, since CMS may establish a maximum price for these products in price negotiations, we would be fully at risk of government action if our products are the subject of Medicare price negotiations. Moreover, given the risk that could be the case, these provisions of the IRA may also further heighten the risk that we would not be able to achieve the expected return on our drug products or full value of our patents protecting our products if prices are set after such products have been on the market for nine years.\nFurther, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year. Failure to participate in negotiations or to reach an agreement can result in a manufacturer being required to withdraw all drug products from coverage under Medicare and Medicaid. Drug price negotiations and other program implementation measures could potentially be affected by the Executive Order, Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions, issued on January 20, 2025 and/or the anticipated change in leadership at Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under the new administration.\nWe anticipate that the U.S. Congress, administrative agencies, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include:\n\n●   controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs;\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   caps or mandatory discounts under certain government sponsored programs;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n94\n\n\n\n\n●   controls on healthcare providers;\n-------------------------------------\n\n●   challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits on reimbursement of specific products through other means;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   reform of drug importation laws and policies;\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n●   expansion of use of managed care systems in which the healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   requirements or restrictions related to direct-to-consumer advertising or drug marketing practices.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. In particular, we are unable to predict what changes the current administration will implement through the U.S. Congress or future executive orders and how these would impact us. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted, could significantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for our products, which would have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results. Changes in FDA laws, regulations, and policies may also make it more difficult to obtain and maintain marketing authorizations.\nIn the EU, similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize Translarna, Upstaza and our product candidates. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. We cannot predict how future changes relating to healthcare reform in the EU, the United States, or other territories, will affect our business.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have also been made to expand post-approval requirements, limit regulatory exclusivity periods or the applicability of such exclusivity periods, restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products and to otherwise encourage competition in the market and bring down drug prices, including proposals and regulatory actions related to drug importation. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted in any territory in which we are authorized, or become authorized, to market our products or product candidates, or whether applicable regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing authorizations of our products or product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA’s approval process or by comparable ex-U.S. bodies overseeing regulatory authorities in other territories may significantly delay or prevent marketing authorization, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. We cannot predict how future changes relating to pre- and post-marketing approval and requirements will affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may expend our resources to pursue a particular product, product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe focus on products, research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential.\nFor example, in connection with our acquisition of Censa, we paid to the Censa securityholders (i) cash consideration of $15.0 million, which consisted of an upfront payment of $10.4 million and an additional $4.6 million for the net assets on Censa’s opening balance sheet as of the date of the acquisition, and (ii) 845,364 shares of our common stock. Censa securityholders may also be entitled to receive contingent consideration payments from us in the future. For example, we expect to make payments to the former Censa securityholders of $57.5 million in the aggregate in cash upon the potential achievement in 2025 of regulatory milestones relating to sepiapterin pursuant to the Censa Merger Agreement. We may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Censa and by investing our resources in sepiapterin, we may be required to forgo or delay other opportunities.\nIn addition, we have previously commenced clinical trials that were not successful for a number of reasons, including inconsistent or negative data and difficulties identifying qualified patients. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us \n\n\n95\n\n\n\nto fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.\nNotwithstanding our large investments to date and anticipated future expenditures in proprietary technologies for small-molecule drug discovery, to date we have been granted marketing authorization for a limited number of commercial products and have not achieved profitability. We may never realize a return on investment. We may not be able to successfully renew or satisfy the ongoing requirements of our current marketing authorizations for our current products and we may never successfully develop any other marketable drugs or indications using our scientific approach. As a result of pursuing the development of product candidates using our proprietary technologies, we may fail to develop product candidates or address indications based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development. For example, in November 2024, we announced that the global Phase 2 placebo-controlled CardinALS study of utreloxastat for the treatment of ALS did not meet its primary endpoint of slowing disease progression on the composite ALSFRS-R and mortality analysis. Due to the lack of efficacy and biomarker signal, further development of utreloxastat for the treatment of ALS is not planned at this time after previous investments in this product candidate.\nIf we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\n\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture and distribution of our products and certain of our product candidates, which may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates, such quantities may not meet the applicable regulatory quality standards, or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization or development efforts.\nWe have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and currently rely on third parties to manufacture our products and certain product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We currently rely on third parties for supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients used in all of our products and product candidates. We outsource most of the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and distribution of our products and certain of our product candidates to third parties, including our commercial supply of Translarna, Emflaza, and Upstaza/Kebilidi.\nWe do not directly control manufacturing for our products and product candidates and we are dependent on and will continue to be dependent on, our contract manufacturers for compliance with cGMP or good distribution practice, or GDP, or similar regulatory requirements outside the EU and the United States for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. Should we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with these requirements, we and they could face significant regulatory and commercial consequences. For example, regulatory authorities routinely inspect manufacturing and other drug/biologic facilities. Our manufacturers and manufacturing facilities must also be approved by such regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our marketing applications and will be subject to continuing regulatory authority inspections should we receive marketing approval. If we or our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the EU member state regulatory authorities, FDA, or other ex-U.S. regulatory agencies, we and they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for the manufacturing facilities, and we would not be able to secure and/or maintain, or may be delayed in securing regulatory approval of marketing applications or supplements for the applicable products or product candidates. We may also have to repeat studies that used product that did not conform with applicable requirements. In addition, we or third-party manufacturers or distributors may not be able to comply with generally accepted worker safety standards, cGMP, GDP or similar regulatory requirements outside the EU and the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers or distributors, over whom we have no direct control, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds or termination of clinical studies, warning or untitled letters, regulatory communications warning the public about safety issues with a product, import or export refusals, \n\n\n96\n\n\n\nlicense revocation, seizures, detentions, or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions, criminal prosecutions or debarment, suits under the civil False Claims act, corporate integrity agreements, or consent decrees, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our reputation and supplies of our products or product candidates and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we have no direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Furthermore, all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which exposes our manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such other materials and products. As a result, failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may generally affect the regulatory status of our contract manufacturers’ facilities and our products or product candidates. If the FDA, EU member state regulatory authorities or a comparable ex-U.S. regulatory agency do not approve these or our facilities for the manufacture of our products or product candidates or if it withdraws its approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would negatively impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our products or product candidates, if approved. There is also no guarantee that we would be able to find alternative manufacturing facilities or enter into agreements with alternative manufacturers on favorable terms. There may be limited manufacturers who would have the ability to manufacture our products and product candidates, especially our gene therapy product candidates, particularly as the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry becomes increasingly more consolidated. Moreover, any alternative manufacturers would need to be approved by the relevant regulatory authority, which approval is not guaranteed. We, accordingly, may not be able to make alternative manufacturing arrangements, which could adversely affect our products, product candidates, and our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 1. Business—Manufacturing” for additional information regarding the manufacturing of our products and product candidates.\nEven if we are able to establish and maintain arrangements with third-party manufacturers, distributors and other third parties, reliance on such third parties entails additional risks, including:\n\n●   reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the possible breach of the agreements by the third party;\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the possibility of commercial supplies of our products not being distributed to commercial vendors or end users in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the possibility of clinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the possibility of third-party resources not being devoted in the manner necessary to satisfy our requirements within the expected time frame;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the possibility of third parties not providing us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using our products, or serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding our products;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the possibility of third parties being unable to satisfy their financial obligations to us or to others; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the possible termination or nonrenewal of a critical agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMany additional factors could cause production or distribution interruptions with the manufacture and distribution of any of our products and product candidates, including human error, natural disasters, labor disputes, acts of terrorism or war, equipment malfunctions, contamination, supply chain disruption, including disruptions caused by outbreaks of contagious disease, any new tariffs imposed in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or raw material and component shortages. For example, we have previously experienced delays in receiving certain raw materials in connection with supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, these delays did not affect or delay our manufacturing given our inventories for such materials at the time. If future supply chain disruptions create prolonged delays, the supplies of our products or products candidates may be significantly and adversely affected and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\n97\n\n\n\nOur products and product candidates and any other products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. In addition, changes in cGMP regulations could negatively impact our ability or the ability of our contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing process of our products and our product candidates in a compliant manner on the schedule we require for commercial and clinical trial use, respectively.\nIf we or the third parties that we engage to manufacture product for our commercial sales, preclinical tests and clinical trials should, prior to the time that we have validated alternative providers, cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience delays in our ability to supply our products or product candidates to patients or in our ability to advance our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our products or product candidates or the drug substances used to manufacture them, we will lose commercial sales revenue and it will be more difficult for us to develop our product candidates and compete effectively. \nIn addition, to the extent that any contract manufactures that we engage develop proprietary manufacturing processes or procedures, should we need to change manufacturers, we may not be able to transfer know-how to a new manufacturer. In such a case, the new manufacturer would need to invest substantial time, money, and effort to develop its own processes and procedures, which would require regulatory authority approval.\nThird parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of our products that do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture and distribution of Translarna, Emflaza, Upstaza, Kebilidi, Tegsedi, Waylivra and our product candidates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and limit our ability to grow including our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize our products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe do not independently conduct preclinical or clinical trials for our products or product candidates. We rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to perform this function. While we have agreements governing the activities of such third parties, we have limited influence and control over their actual performance and activities. For instance, our third-party service providers are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, non-clinical, and preclinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies or clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our trials may be repeated, extended, delayed, or terminated, we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates, or we or they may be subject to regulatory enforcement actions. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. To the extent we are unable to successfully identify and manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be materially and adversely affected. Further, any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it will delay our product development activities.\n\n\n98\n\n\n\nOur reliance on these third parties for clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. We are required to monitor the activities of these third parties but our monitoring may not be able to detect any existing or emerging issues. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as GCP for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, we will be required to report certain financial interests of our third-party investigators if these relationships exceed certain financial thresholds or meet other criteria. The FDA or comparable ex-U.S. regulatory authorities may question the integrity of the data from those clinical trials conducted by investigators who may have conflicts of interest. We must further ensure that our preclinical trials are conducted in accordance with good laboratory practices, or GLPs, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities enforce these requirements through periodic inspections or remote regulatory assessments of trial sponsors, clinical and preclinical investigators, and trial sites. Similar GCP and transparency requirements apply in the EU. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, including with respect to clinical trials conducted outside the EU and United States, can also lead regulatory authorities to refuse to accept into account clinical trial data submitted as part of a marketing application, as well as other regulatory consequences, as further described above.\nFurthermore, third parties that we rely on for our clinical development activities may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing authorizations for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in testing or obtaining marketing authorizations.\nWe also rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing authorizations of our products or product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nWe currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, on collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of some of our products and product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these products and product candidates.\nFor each of our product candidates, we plan to evaluate the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves or entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, such as our collaborations with Roche and the SMA Foundation, for our SMA program, including Evrysdi. We have entered into arrangements with certain third parties to market or distribute Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in certain countries and, as we continue to implement our commercialization plans for Translarna, we anticipate that we will engage additional third parties to perform these functions for us in other countries. We generally plan to seek collaborators for the development and commercialization of product candidates that have high anticipated development costs, are directed at indications for which a potential collaborator has a particular expertise, or involve markets that require a large sales and marketing organization to serve effectively. Our likely collaborators for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements may include: large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and/or biotechnology companies.\nWe will have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates and our collaborators will be subject to the same product development and commercialization risks that we are subject to. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators’ desire and ability to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements in a compliant manner. In particular, the commercial success of Evrysdi will depend on the success of Roche’s commercialization program. Furthermore, the successful development of another product candidate from our spinal \n\n\n99\n\n\n\nmuscular atrophy program will depend on the success of our collaborations with the SMA Foundation and Roche, including whether Roche pursues clinical development of any other compounds identified under the collaborations. \nCollaborations involving our products and product candidates, including our collaborations with the SMA Foundation and Roche, pose the following risks to us:\n\n●   collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our products and product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs, based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators’ strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that replace or compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   collaborators may fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, subjecting them or us to potential regulatory enforcement action;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   disputes may arise between the collaborator and us as to the ownership of intellectual property arising during the collaboration;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we may grant exclusive rights for our products or product candidates to our collaborators, which would prevent us from collaborating with others, or from using our products or product candidates ourselves;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the collaboration, which may include ending research, development or commercialization activities for our products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nWe may rely on third parties to perform many essential services for any products that we commercialize, including services related to warehousing and inventory control, distribution, government price reporting, customer service, accounts receivable management, cash collection, and pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting. If these third parties fail to perform as expected or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize our product candidates will be significantly impacted and we may be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nWe may retain third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the sale and distribution of our product candidates, key aspects of which will be out of our direct control. These service providers may provide key services related to warehousing and inventory control, distribution, customer service, accounts receivable management, and cash collection. If we retain a service provider, we will substantially rely on it as well as other third-party providers that perform services for us, including entrusting our inventories of products to their care and handling. If these third-party service \n\n\n100\n\n\n\nproviders fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical or natural damage at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired and we may be subject to regulatory enforcement action.\nIn addition, we may engage third parties to perform various other services for us relating to pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting, safety database management, fulfillment of requests for medical information regarding our product candidates and related services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, or these third parties otherwise fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nAdditionally, we may contract with a third party to calculate and report pricing information mandated by various government programs. If a third party fails to timely report or adjust prices as required, or makes errors in calculating government pricing information from transactional data in our financial records, it could impact our discount and rebate liability, and potentially subject us to regulatory sanctions or False Claims Act lawsuits.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our, or our collaborators’ or third-party vendors’, cyber-security.\nWe collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including personal information, operational and financial transactions and records, clinical trial data and information relating to intellectual property, on internal information systems and through the information systems of collaborators and third-party vendors with whom we contract. Despite our implementation of security measures, including implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework, instituting a training and compliance program on cybersecurity for all employees and doing a yearly external audit and penetration test, these information systems are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, ransomware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet or other mechanisms, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. No such security measures can eliminate the possibility of the information systems’ improper functioning or the improper access or disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity-related risks have generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, collaborators, or other third-party vendors to disclose sensitive information or take other actions, including making fraudulent payments or downloading malware, by using “spoofing” and “phishing” emails or other types of attacks. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy, despite our having a security risk insurance policy and disaster recovery and incident response plans. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability, damage to our reputation, suffer loss or harm to our intellectual property rights, face significant financial exposure, including incurring significant costs to remediate possible injury to the affected parties and the further research, development and commercial efforts of our products and product candidates could be delayed.\nProduct liability and other civil lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit clinical trials or commercialization of any current or future products. Our insurance program may not be extensive enough to adequately protect us against these risks.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the commercialization of our products and the human clinical trials testing of our products and product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates, products or gene therapy product materials caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\n●   reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   decreased demand for our products or any product candidates that we may develop;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n101\n\n\n\n\n●   injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the inability to continue current clinical trials or begin planned clinical trials;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   withdrawal or reduced enrollment of clinical trial participants;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   significant costs to defend the related claims/litigation;\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   increased insurance costs, or an inability to maintain appropriate insurance coverage;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   substantial monetary awards to trial participants, patients and/or their families;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   loss of revenue;\n--------------------\n\n●   the inability to commercialize or to continue commercializing any products or product candidates;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   initiation of investigations and enforcement actions by regulators; and\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the withdrawal of products from the market, product recalls, or the cessation of development or regulatory disapproval of product candidates or withdrawal of approvals, as well as labeling, marketing, or promotional restrictions.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe have a broad insurance program covering risks appropriate to our research and development activities and clinical programs and aggregate annual limits of $25.0 million covering our products and sales. We also have industry standard insurance policies covering other aspects of our business and operations based on our locations, activities and other relevant factors. With respect to all insurance matters, we are advised by our insurance brokers, and our insurance advisor who we retain and compensate on a non-commission basis. However, our insurance program may not adequately cover the risks that we face for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n●   certain risks and related losses, such as delays to our clinical and development programs, are too speculative or unquantifiable for us to adequately insure against;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   if we were to face multiple claims, renewing or replacing our insurance may become more expensive, the terms (including deductibles and limits) we receive may worsen, and we may even have difficulty securing any coverage at all;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our insurance limits may not be adequate to cover all liabilities and defense costs that we may incur; and\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we may need to further increase our insurance coverage if we commercialize our current products in additional jurisdictions, our sales increase, or we commercialize new products.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nThe cost of insurance coverage is highly variable, based on a wide range of factors. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability or defense costs that may arise.\nIn addition, we could be subject to other costly civil litigation, including contractual claims with respect to our expected manufacturing of gene therapy product materials for potential external customers. If our customers believe that we have violated our contractual terms, they may seek reimbursement for the cost of our gene therapy product materials or other related losses, the cost of which could be significant.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, manufacturing and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations currently, and may in the future, involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and medical and biological materials, and produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials or disposal of hazardous wastes, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or manufacturing and distribution efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\n\n\n102\n\n\n\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on Dr. Matthew Klein, our Chief Executive Officer, and the other principal members of our executive, commercial and scientific teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent our executives from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain “key person” insurance on any of our executive officers. The loss of the services of any of these persons might impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection or other intellectual property rights with respect to our proprietary technology and products. One primary way that we seek to protect our proprietary position is by filing patent applications in the United States and in certain ex-U.S. jurisdictions related to our proprietary technology and products. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications. It is also possible that we will fail to file a patent application on patentable aspects of our research and development. Moreover, if we license technology or product candidates from third parties, these license agreements may not permit us to control the filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain or enforce the patents. These agreements could also give our licensors the right to enforce the licensed patents without our involvement, or to decide not to enforce the patents at all. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the commercial value of our patent rights is highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents.\nThe laws of ex-U.S. countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, patent law in many countries restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. In addition, we may not pursue or obtain or be able to pursue or obtain patent protection in all major markets. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, the first to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. In addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011, or the Act, which reformed certain patent laws in the U.S., may create additional uncertainty. The significant changes engendered by the Act include switching from a “first-to-invent” system to a “first-to-file” system, and the implementation of new procedures that permit competitors to challenge our patents in the USPTO after grant, including inter partes review and post grant review.\n\n\n103\n\n\n\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party prior art submissions in a patent office, or may become involved in patent office proceedings, including oppositions, derivation proceedings, reexamination, inter partes review, post grant review, interference proceedings, or litigation, in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us.\nEven if our patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection or prevent competitors from competing with us. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Other companies may also attempt to circumvent any regulatory data protection or market exclusivity that we obtain under applicable legislation, which may require us to allocate significant resources to prevent such circumvention. Legal and regulatory developments in the European Union, or EU, and elsewhere may also result in clinical trial data and other information, that would ordinarily be treated as trade secret, submitted as part of a marketing authorization application becoming publicly available. The EMA Policy on publication of clinical data and other such information, as well as the current application of EU freedom of information regulations, could impact our proprietary information (comprising both clinical and non-clinical data and other information) that would normally be maintained by a regulatory body as commercially confidential. Such developments could enable other companies to circumvent our intellectual property rights and use our clinical trial data or other information to obtain marketing authorizations in the EU and in other jurisdictions where we have not been able to obtain any intellectual property or regulatory protection, resulting in loss of market share. Such developments may also require us to allocate significant resources or engage in litigation to prevent other companies from circumventing or violating our intellectual property rights. Our attempts to prevent third parties from circumventing or violating our intellectual property and other rights may ultimately be unsuccessful. We may also fail to take the required actions to maintain our patents.\nFor example, during 2015, we were notified by the EMA that it had received from another pharmaceutical company a request under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 seeking access to aspects of our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD. Following the decision of the EMA to release such documentation with only minimal redactions we initiated litigation before the General Court of the EU to prevent disclosure of this information. In the first quarter of 2018, the Court ruled in favor of the EMA, allowing the EMA to release the documentation. We appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice of the EU, or CJEU, but the CJEU dismissed our appeal in January 2020 and released the information to the requester.\nAn issued patent may be challenged, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file a lawsuit and claims for damages, which can be expensive and time consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property or defenses, such that they do not infringe our intellectual property or that our intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent’s claims narrowly or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue.\n\n\n104\n\n\n\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that our patents are invalid and unenforceable or that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the intellectual property and other proprietary rights of third parties. We may not be aware of all intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product and our product candidates. Typically, patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and new patent applications are continuously publishing. Thus, we may not be aware of patents or patent applications relating to our product or our product candidates. There may be pending or future patent applications that, if issued, would block us from commercializing our products. Thus, we do not know with certainty whether any of our products or product candidates, or our commercialization thereof, would or would not infringe any third party’s intellectual property.\nWe may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights or other proprietary with respect to our products and technology. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. We may allege that a third-party patent we are alleged to infringe is invalid and/or we may be able to avail ourselves in the United States of the safe harbor exemption provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act as a basis for non-infringement. In order to successfully challenge the validity of a third party issued U.S. patent that we are alleged to infringe, we would need to overcome that patent’s presumption of validity in district court or prove unpatentability by a preponderance of the evidence before the USPTO in a post grant proceeding. There is no assurance that a court or the USPTO would find these claims to be invalid or unpatentable, respectively. \nIf we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, or in order to avoid or settle litigation, we may seek to obtain a license to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any such license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Also, any license obtained may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us, and could require us to make substantial payments. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing an alleged infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our products or our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property of any such employee’s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\n\n\n105\n\n\n\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of such proceedings. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development, sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWithout patent protection, our marketed products may face generic competition.\nCertain of the products we market have no or limited patent protection and, as a result, potential competitors face fewer regulatory barriers in introducing competing products. Without patent protection or other regulatory exclusivity, we may not be able to exclude others from, among other things, selling or importing similar products in any jurisdiction. In some instances, we may rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our commercial position, although we may be unable to provide adequate protection for our commercial position via these means. In other instances, we may need to rely on regulatory exclusivity to protect our commercial position.\nFurthermore, generic competition against a branded product often results in decreases in the prices at which the branded product can be sold, particularly when there is more than one generic product available in the marketplace. Third-party companies could also develop products that are similar, but not identical, to our marketed products, such as an alternative formulation of our product or an alternative formulation combined with a different delivery technology, and seek approval in the United States by referencing our products and relying, to some degree, on the FDA’s finding that our products are safe and effective in their approved indications. In addition, legislation enacted in the United States allows for, and in a few instances, in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician, mandates the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products where a generic version is available.\nOn February 9, 2017, the FDA approved the corticosteroid Emflaza for the treatment of patients 5 years and older with DMD. Although approved for other indications outside of the United States, this was the first approval for deflazacort in the United States and the first approval in the United States for the use of a corticosteroid to treat DMD. We have previously relied on an orphan exclusivity period to commercialize Emflaza in the United States. Emflaza’s seven-year period of orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients five years and older expired in February 2024. We expect the expiration of this orphan drug exclusivity to have a significant negative impact on Emflaza net product revenue. Emflaza’s orphan drug exclusivity related to the treatment of DMD in patients two years of age to less than five expires in June 2026.\nWe currently have no issued patents that could prevent a third-party company from seeking to introduce a generic Emflaza formulation in the United States for the treatment of DMD or another indication, and we do not expect to be able to obtain such patent protection. Such third-party companies may also obtain patents covering a new deflazacort formulation or method of use.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents and regulatory exclusivity for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. More particularly, we may rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information to protect our competitive position related to our products and product candidates, especially when patent protection is not obtainable. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract \n\n\n106\n\n\n\nmanufacturers, consultants, advisors, partners and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. However, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or that the agreements we have executed will provide adequate protection. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be obtained or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed. If our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, employees, consultants, advisors, partners and other third parties develop new inventions or processes related to our products independently, or jointly with us, that may be applicable to our products under development, disputes may arise about ownership or proprietary rights to those inventions and processes. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our inventions or trade secrets is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside of the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nOur trademark applications may be refused registration, or our registered trademarks may not be maintained or may be found to be unenforceable. During trademark examination proceedings, our trademark applications may be rejected. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections in most jurisdictions, we may not be able to successfully overcome them. In addition, in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and Trademark Offices in many other jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications or to seek cancellation of registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. Further, if we do not secure registrations for our trademarks, we may encounter difficulty enforcing our trademark rights against third parties in the jurisdictions where we do not have registered rights.\nIf we are not able to obtain adequate trademark protection or regulatory approval for our brand names, we may be required to re-brand affected products, which could cause delays in getting such products to market and substantially increase our costs.\nTo protect our rights in any trademark we intend to use for our products or product candidates, we may seek to register such trademarks. Trademark registration is territory-specific and we must apply for trademark registration in the United States as well as any other country where we intend to commercialize our product or product candidates. Failure to obtain trademark registrations may place our use of the trademarks at risk or make them subject to legal challenges, which could force us to choose alternative names for our product or product candidates. In addition, the FDA, and other regulatory authorities outside the United States, conduct an independent review of proposed product names for pharmaceuticals, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other pharmaceutical product names for medications, which could result in medication errors in prescribing, dispensing and consumption. These regulatory authorities may also object to a proposed product name if they believe the name inappropriately makes or implies a therapeutic claim. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities outside the United States object to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt alternative names for our product or product candidates. If we adopt alternative names, either because of our inability to obtain a trademark registration or because of objections from regulatory authorities, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications and the rights attached thereto. Consequently, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to adopt a new product name that would be registrable under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, which could cause delays in getting our products to market and substantially increase our costs. Furthermore, in the United States and many other jurisdictions, a trademark registration may be cancelled through cancellation or forfeiture proceedings brought by a third party or from non-use of the trademark in that jurisdiction. We may not be able to build a successful brand \n\n\n107\n\n\n\nidentity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product or our product candidates.\nOur rights to develop and commercialize Upstaza/Kebilidi are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others.\nWe depend upon the intellectual property rights granted to us under licenses from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of Upstaza/Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC deficiency. In particular, we have in-licensed certain intellectual property rights and know-how from National Taiwan University, or NTU, relevant to Upstaza/Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC deficiency. Any termination of these licenses could result in the loss of significant or all rights licensed to us and could harm or prevent our ability to commercialize Upstaza/Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC deficiency. Each of our existing gene therapy licensing agreements are exclusive but are limited to particular fields, such as AADC deficiency and are subject to certain retained rights. \nOur current gene therapy license agreements, including our agreement with NTU pursuant to which we have in-licensed certain intellectual property rights and know-how relevant to Upstaza/Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC deficiency, impose various obligations, including certain payment obligations, including contingent payments to be made upon reaching certain development and regulatory milestones. If we fail to satisfy our obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the agreement. Disputes may arise between us and any of our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to such agreements and other issues. Such disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed or the terms of our license agreements, including with respect to Upstaza/Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC deficiency, may prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, or may impair the value of the arrangement to us. Any such dispute could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Agilis. If we cannot maintain a necessary license agreement, including with respect to Upstaza/Kebilidi for the treatment of AADC deficiency, or if the agreement is terminated, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements and expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. Our existing licenses impose, and we expect that future licenses will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we might not be able to market any product that is covered by these agreements, which could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under such license agreement. Termination of these license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms or cause us to lose rights in important intellectual property or technology.\nWe have also received grant funding for some of our development programs from philanthropic organizations and patient advocacy groups pursuant to agreements that impose development and commercialization diligence obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, the applicable organization could require us to grant to the organization exclusive rights under certain of our intellectual property, which could materially adversely affect the value to us of product candidates covered by that intellectual property even if we are entitled to a share of any consideration received by such organization in connection with any subsequent development or commercialization of the product candidates.\nSome of our patented technology was developed with U.S. federal government funding. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise “march-in” rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the U.S. government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, U.S. government-funded inventions must be reported to the government and U.S. government \n\n\n108\n\n\n\nfunding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications. Furthermore, our rights in such inventions are subject to government license rights and certain restrictions on manufacturing products outside the United States.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nServicing the 2026 Convertible Notes requires a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our debt, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of, or to repurchase, the 2026 Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn September 2019, we incurred indebtedness in the amount of $287.5 million in aggregate principal with additional accrued interest under the 2026 Convertible Notes, for which interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance the 2026 Convertible Notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt, including the 2026 Convertible Notes. If we are unable to generate cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be unfavorable to us or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we seek to refinance such indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nUpon conversion of the 2026 Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2026 Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase 2026 Convertible Notes, to pay the 2026 Convertible Notes at maturity or to pay cash upon conversions of 2026 Convertible Notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase 2026 Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of 2026 Convertible Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase 2026 Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture, to make interest payments on the 2026 Convertible Notes when due under the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2026 Convertible Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture governing the 2026 Convertible Notes. An event of default under the indenture governing the 2026 Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of any such related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase the 2026 Convertible Notes, make interest payments on the 2026 Convertible Notes or make cash payments upon conversions of the 2026 Convertible Notes.\nEven if holders of the 2026 Convertible Notes do not elect to convert their 2026 Convertible Notes, we could be required to reclassify all of the outstanding principal of the 2026 Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability in accordance with applicable accounting rules, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any \n\n\n109\n\n\n\nattempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\n●   provide for a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   allow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   limit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   establish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n--------------------------------------------\n\n●   authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a “poison pill” that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   require the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock and lawsuits against us and our officers and directors.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price at which they purchased it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\n●   our ability to maintain our marketing authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in the EEA following the CHMP’s negative opinion on the conditional marketing authorization following a re-examination procedure, and the EC’s potential adoption of the negative opinion, or identify other potential mechanisms in which we may provide Translarna to nmDMD patients in the EEA;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to maintain the marketing authorization for Translarna and our other products in territories outside of the EEA;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   expectations with respect to sepiapterin for the treatment of PKU, including any potential regulatory submissions and potential approvals;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   expectations with respect to Upstaza/Kebilidi, including any potential regulatory submissions and potential approvals;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   expectations with respect to vatiquinone for the treatment of FA, including any potential regulatory submissions and potential approvals;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   any developments related to our ability or inability to execute our commercialization strategy for any of our products;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to resolve the matters set forth in the FDA’s denial of our appeal to the CRL we received from the FDA in connection with our NDA for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the commercialization of Evrysdi and the development of the SMA program with Roche and the SMA Foundation;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   results of clinical trials of any other product candidate that we develop;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   any additional clinical or non-clinical trial required by regulatory agencies for our products or product candidates;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, licenses, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n110\n\n\n\n\n●   negative publicity around our products or product candidates;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   other developments concerning our regulatory submissions;\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the success of competitive products or technologies;\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   results of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors, including negative results that investors may associate with our product candidates;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our ability to realize the benefits of our acquisitions or other business combinations;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the loss of distributors, suppliers or manufacturers;\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the level of expenses related to any of our products, product candidates or clinical development programs;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   announcements with respect to litigation;\n---------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   general economic, industry and market conditions, including potentially high inflation rates and sustained high interest rates; and\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nCompanies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have frequently been the subject of securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation. For example, in 2018 we settled a securities class action lawsuit initiated against us and certain of our current and former executive officers during 2016, as well as derivative lawsuits brought against us, as a nominal defendant, certain of our current and former executive officers and certain of our current and former directors during 2017. We could be the target of other such litigation in the future. Class action and derivative lawsuits, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs, damage or settlement awards and a diversion of our management’s resources and attention from running our business, which could materially harm our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders’ sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders’ sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nThe issuance of additional shares of our common stock or the sale of shares of our common stock by our stockholders could dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest in the Company and could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. \nWe have issued a significant number of equity awards under our equity compensation plans or as inducement grants to new hire employees pursuant to Nasdaq rules. The shares underlying these awards are registered on a Form S-8 registration statement. As a result, upon vesting these shares can be freely exercised and sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. The exercise of options and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock or the sale of restricted stock upon vesting could cause a decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\n\n\n111\n\n\n\nCertain of our employees, executive officers and directors have entered or may enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time. Under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the employee, director or officer when entering into the plan, without further direction from the employee, officer or director. A Rule 10b5-1 plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances. Our employees, executive officers and directors may also buy or sell additional shares outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material, nonpublic information.\nAdditionally, certain shares that we issued in connection with our acquisitions or other strategic transactions have not yet been sold and are currently restricted as a result of securities laws. These shares may be freely sold in the public market subject to any requirements and restrictions, including any applicable volume limitations, imposed by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The sale or resale of these shares in the public market, or the market’s expectation of such sales, may result in an immediate and substantial decline in our stock price. Such a decline will adversely affect our investors and also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock or other securities by our stockholders or by us, including sales made under our At the Market Offering Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $125 million from time to time, through the Sales Agent by any method that is deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act, or the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes or any future securities convertible or exchangeable into our common stock or in connection with a strategic transaction or otherwise, could dilute our stockholders, lower the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity securities.\n​",
