      "text": "Item 1. Business\n​\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n​\nUnless otherwise indicated, “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar terms, as well as references to the “Company,” refer to O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. and its Subsidiaries. O’Reilly is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States (“U.S.”), selling our products to both do-it-yourself (“DIY”) and professional service provider customers, our “dual market strategy.” The business was founded in 1957 by Charles F. O’Reilly and his son, Charles H. “Chub’’ O’Reilly, Sr., and initially operated from a single store in Springfield, Missouri. Our common stock has traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “ORLY” since April 22, 1993.\n​\nOn January 22, 2024, the Company completed the previously announced strategic acquisition of Groupe Del Vasto (“Vast Auto”), an auto parts supplier headquartered in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. At the time of the acquisition, Vast Auto operated two distribution centers and six satellite warehouses that support a network of 23 company-owned stores and thousands of independent jobber and professional customers across Eastern Canada.\n​\nAt December 31, 2024, we operated 6,265 stores in 48 states in the United States and Puerto Rico, 87 stores in Mexico, and 26 stores in Canada. Our stores carry an extensive product line, including\n\n\n●   new and remanufactured automotive hard parts and maintenance items, such as alternators, batteries, brake system components, belts, chassis parts, driveline parts, engine parts, fuel pumps, hoses, starters, temperature control, water pumps, antifreeze, appearance products, engine additives, filters, fluids, lighting, oil, and wiper blades and\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers, and truck accessories.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nOur stores offer many enhanced services and programs to our customers, such as\n\n\n●   battery diagnostic testing;\n-------------------------------\n\n●   battery, wiper, and bulb replacement;\n-----------------------------------------\n\n●   check engine light code extraction, with diagnostic information, list of possible repair fixes, and referrals to trusted local repair shops provided;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   custom hydraulic hoses;\n---------------------------\n\n●   drum and rotor resurfacing;\n-------------------------------\n\n●   electrical and module testing;\n----------------------------------\n\n●   loaner tool program;\n------------------------\n\n●   professional paint shop mixing and related materials; and\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   used oil, oil filter, and battery recycling.\n------------------------------------------------\n​\nSee the “Risk Factors” section of this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of certain risks relevant to our business. These risk factors include, among others, risks related to deteriorating economic conditions; competition in the automotive aftermarket business; our sensitivity to regional economic and weather conditions; our relationships with key suppliers and availability of key products; business interruptions; failure to protect our brand and reputation; risks associated with international operations; unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results; the volatility of the market price of our common stock; our increased debt levels; a downgrade in our credit ratings; information and systems security, damage, and failure; failure to achieve our growth objectives; our dependence upon key personnel; our acquisition success; and litigation, environmental legislation, and other regulations.\n​\nOUR BUSINESS\n​\nOur goal is to continue to achieve growth in sales and profitability by capitalizing on our competitive advantages and executing our growth strategies. We remain confident in our ability to continue to gain market share in our existing markets and grow our business in new markets by focusing on our dual market strategy and the core O’Reilly values, including hard work, superior customer service, and expense control. Our mission is to be the dominant auto parts provider in all the markets we serve by providing a higher level of customer service and a better value position than our competitors to both DIY and professional service provider customers.\n​\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n​\n\nCompetitive Advantages\n​\nWe believe our effective dual market strategy, superior customer service, technically proficient store personnel, strategic distribution network, and experienced management Team make up our key competitive advantages, which cannot be easily duplicated. \n​\nProven Ability to Execute Our Dual Market Strategy:\nFor more than 45 years, we have established a track record of effectively serving, at a high level, both DIY and professional service provider customers. We believe our proven ability to effectively execute a dual market strategy is a unique competitive advantage. The execution of this strategy enables us to better compete by targeting a larger base of automotive aftermarket parts consumers, capitalizing on our existing store and distribution infrastructure, operating profitably in both large markets and less densely populated geographic areas that typically attract fewer national chain competitors, and enhancing service levels offered to DIY customers through the offering of a broad inventory and the extensive product knowledge required by professional service provider customers.\n​\nIn 2024, we derived approximately 52% of our sales from our DIY customers and approximately 48% of our sales from our professional service provider customers. Historically, we have increased our sales to professional service provider customers at a faster pace than the increase in our sales to DIY customers due to the more fragmented nature of the professional service provider business, which offers a greater opportunity for consolidation. We believe we will continue to have a competitive advantage on the professional service provider portion of our business, due to our systems, knowledge, industry-leading parts availability, and experience serving the professional service provider side of the automotive aftermarket, augmented by our approximately 810 full-time sales staff dedicated solely to calling upon and servicing the professional service provider customer. We will also continue to expand and enhance the level of offerings focused on growing our DIY business and will continue to execute our proven dual market strategy in both existing and new markets.\n​\nSuperior Customer Service:\nWe seek to provide our customers with an efficient and pleasant in-store experience by maintaining attractive stores in convenient locations with a wide selection of automotive products. We believe the satisfaction of DIY and professional service provider customers is substantially dependent upon our ability to provide, in a timely fashion, the correct automotive products needed to complete their repairs. Accordingly, each O’Reilly store carries, or has same or next day availability to, a broad selection of automotive products designed to cover a wide range of vehicle applications. We continuously refine the inventory levels and assortments carried in each of our stores and within our network, based in large part on the sales movement tracked by our inventory control system, market vehicle registration data, failure rates, and management’s assessment of the changes and trends in the marketplace. We have no material backorders for the products we sell.\n​\nWe seek to attract new DIY and professional service provider customers and retain existing customers by offering superior customer service, the key elements of which are identified below:\n\n\n●   superior in-store service through highly-motivated, technically-proficient store personnel (“Professional Parts People”);\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   an extensive selection and superior availability of products;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   many enhanced service programs, including battery and electrical testing, battery, wiper and bulb replacement, and check engine light code extractions with diagnostic support;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   attractive stores in convenient locations;\n----------------------------------------------\n\n●   competitive pricing, supported by a good, better, best product assortment designed to meet all of our customers’ quality and value preferences;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   a robust point-of-sale system integrated with our proprietary electronic catalog, which contains a wide variety of product images, schematics and technical specifications, and equips our Team Members with highly effective tools to source products in our extensive supply network;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   online ordering for our professional customers through our proprietary professional customer platforms, www.OReillyPro.com and our O’Reilly Pro mobile application, with local delivery available; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   online ordering, featuring “chat with a parts professional,” parts look up assistance for our DIY customers through our retail platform, www.OReillyAuto.com, with convenient store locations for pick-up-in-store orders or home delivery.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nTechnically Proficient Professional Parts People:\nOur highly-motivated, technically-proficient Professional Parts People provide us with a significant competitive advantage, particularly over less specialized retail operators. We require our Professional Parts People to undergo extensive and ongoing training and to be knowledgeable, particularly with respect to hard part repairs, in order to better serve the technically-oriented professional service \n\n\n6\n\n\n\n​\n\nprovider customers with whom they interact on a daily basis. Such technical proficiency also enhances the customer service we provide to our DIY customers who value the expert assistance provided by our Professional Parts People. See our “Team Members and Human Capital Management” disclosure of the “Business” section of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about our technically proficient professional parts people.\n​\nStrategic Regional Tiered Distribution Network:\nWe believe our commitment to a robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides superior replenishment and access to hard-to-find parts and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network. Our strategic, regional, tiered distribution network includes distribution centers (“DCs”) and Hub stores. Our inventory management and distribution systems electronically link each of our stores to one or more DCs, which provides for efficient inventory control and management. We currently operate 31 DCs, which typically provides our stores with same-day or overnight access to over 153,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”), many of which are hard-to-find items not typically stocked by other auto parts retailers. To augment our robust distribution network, we operate a total of 396 Hub stores that also provide delivery service and same-day access to stores within the surrounding areas to an average of 55,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 107,000 SKUs. More than 95% of our stores receive multiple same-day deliveries and deliveries on weekends of hard to find parts from our DCs and Hub stores. We believe this timely access to a broad range of products is a key competitive advantage in satisfying customer demand and generating repeat business. \n​\nExperienced Management Team:\nOur Company philosophy is to “promote from within,” and the vast majority of our senior managers, district managers, and store managers have been promoted from within the Company. We augment this “promote from within” philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, technical proficiency, or subject matter expertise. We have a strong management Team that has demonstrated the consistent ability to successfully execute our business plan and growth strategy by generating 32 consecutive years of record revenues and earnings and positive comparable store sales results since becoming a public company in April of 1993. See our “Team Members and Human Capital Management” disclosure of the “Business” section of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about our experienced management Team.\n​\nGrowth Strategy\n​\nAggressively Open New Stores:\nWe intend to continue to consolidate the fragmented automotive aftermarket. During 2024, we opened 198 net, new stores and acquired 23 stores in Canada. In 2025, we plan to open 200 to 210 net, new stores, which will increase our penetration in existing markets and allow for expansion into new, contiguous markets. The sites for these new stores have been identified, and to date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in locating suitable sites for construction of new stores or identifying suitable acquisition targets for conversion to O’Reilly stores. We typically open new stores by\n\n\n(i)   constructing a new facility or renovating an existing facility on property we purchase or lease and stocking the new store with fixtures and inventory;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(ii)   acquiring an independently owned auto parts store (“jobber store”), typically by the purchase of substantially all of the inventory and other assets (other than realty) of such store; or\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(iii)   purchasing multi-store chains.\n--------------------------------------\n​\nNew store sites are strategically located in clusters within geographic areas that complement our distribution network in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising, and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process include population density and growth patterns, demographic lifestyle segmentation, age and per capita income, vehicle traffic counts, vehicles in operation, number and type of existing automotive repair facilities, and competing auto parts stores within a predetermined radius.\n​\nWe target both small and large markets for expansion of our store network. While we have, and continue to face, aggressive competition in the more densely populated markets, we believe we have competed effectively, and are well positioned to continue to compete effectively, in such markets in order to achieve our goal of continued profitable sales growth within these markets. We also believe that with our dual market strategy, we are better able to operate stores in less densely populated areas, which would not otherwise support a national chain store selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Therefore, we continue to pursue opening new stores in less densely populated market areas as part of our growth strategy.\n​\nGrow Sales in Existing Stores:\nProfitable comparable store sales growth is also an important part of our growth strategy. To achieve improved sales and profitability at existing O’Reilly stores, we continually strive to improve the service provided to our customers. We believe that while competitive \n\n\n7\n\n\n\n​\n\npricing is an essential component of successful growth in the automotive aftermarket business, it is customer satisfaction, whether of the DIY consumer or professional service provider, resulting from superior customer service, that generates sustainable increased sales and profitability.\n​\nSelectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions:\nThe automotive aftermarket industry is still highly fragmented, and we believe the ability of national auto parts chains, like O’Reilly, to operate more efficiently and effectively than smaller independent operators will result in continued industry consolidation. Our intention is to continue to selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that will strengthen our position as a leading automotive aftermarket parts supplier in existing markets and provide a springboard for expansion into new domestic and international markets.\n​\nContinually Enhance Store Design and Location:\nOur current prototype store design features optimized square footage, high ceilings, convenient interior store layouts, in-store signage, multilingual signage, bright lighting, convenient ingress and egress, ample parking, and dedicated counters to serve professional service provider customers, each designed to increase sales and operating efficiencies to enhance overall customer service. We continually update the location and condition of our store network through systematic renovation and relocation of our existing stores to enhance store performance. During 2024, we relocated 12 stores and performed minor to major updates or renovations to approximately 710 additional stores. We believe that our ability to consistently achieve growth in comparable store sales is due in part to our commitment to maintaining an attractive store network, which is strategically located to best attract and serve our customers. \n​\nOmnichannel Growth Strategy:\nOur Omnichannel growth strategies reflect the continued evolution of customer preferences in researching and completing purchases. More than ever before, our customers’ purchase decisions are informed by a range of interactions, whether in-person, over the phone, or through a variety of digital channels, as they seek to find the professional parts knowledge and product availability they need to meet their automotive repair and maintenance needs. Our Omnichannel growth strategies are focused on offering our customers an enhanced and seamless research and buying experience through any of these channels. We have long been known for excellent customer service and continue to grow the functionality and user-friendliness of our digital platforms, including www.OReillyAuto.com, www.OReillyPro.com, and our O’Reilly Pro mobile application, to enhance our customers’ shopping experience. Many of our customers interact over multiple channels to research and complete a purchase, and the functionality and features of our digital properties complement the outstanding customer service provided in our brick and mortar locations.\n​\nTeam Members and Human Capital Management\n​\nOur tradition for 68 years has been to treat all of our Team Members with honesty and respect and to commit significant resources to instill in them our “Live Green” culture, which emphasizes the importance of each Team Member’s contribution to the success of O’Reilly. This focus on professionalism and respect has created an industry-leading Team, and we consider our relations with our Team Members to be excellent. \n​\nWe are committed to providing a work environment that allows Team Members to feel highly valued and to be productive and effective in their jobs by maintaining an inclusive environment and healthy work/life balance, which we believe increases Team Member engagement. Our ongoing emphasis on engagement and inclusion, including our policies, recruitment and selection procedures, onboarding processes, and training efforts, positively builds upon our successful “promote from within” philosophy and growth strategies. \n​\nTalent Acquisition, Retention, and Training:\nOur Company knows the value of a tenured Team, which is why our philosophy is to “promote from within” first. As management opportunities arise, we look first within the Company and promote those who have performed well, have the right expertise, and have shown leadership potential before looking outside the Company; however, we augment this philosophy by pursuing strategic hires with a strong emphasis on automotive aftermarket experience, customer service excellence, subject matter expertise, and strong culture fit. This comprehensive approach increases Team Member commitment and has resulted in a very experienced leadership Team. As of December 31, 2024, our strong management Team was comprised of 251 senior managers who average 19 years of service, 310 corporate managers who average 13 years of service, and 637 district managers who average 14 years of service.\n​\nEach of our stores is staffed with a store manager and one or more assistant managers, in addition to parts specialists, retail and/or installer service specialists, and other positions required to meet the specific needs of each store. Each of our 637 district managers has general supervisory responsibility for an average of 10 stores, which provides our stores with strong operational support.\n​\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n​\n\nWe offer a variety of specific training programs that address a broad spectrum of topics from store and distribution center operations to customer service. We believe our highly trained Team of Professional Parts People is essential in providing superior customer service to both DIY and professional service provider customers. A significant portion of our business is from professional service provider customers; therefore, our Professional Parts People are required to be highly technically proficient in automotive products. In addition, we have found that the typical DIY customer often seeks assistance from Professional Parts People, particularly when purchasing hard parts. The ability of our Professional Parts People to provide such assistance to the DIY customer creates a favorable impression and is a significant factor in generating repeat DIY business.\n​\nWe screen prospective Team Members to identify highly motivated individuals who either have experience with automotive parts and repairs or automotive aptitude. New store Team Members go through a comprehensive orientation focused on the culture of our Company, as well as the requirements for their specific position. Additionally, during their first year of employment, our parts specialists go through extensive automotive systems and product knowledge training to ensure they are able to provide high levels of service to our customers. Once all of the required training has been satisfied, our parts specialists become eligible to take the O’Reilly Certified Parts Professional test. Passing the O’Reilly test helps prepare them to become certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (“ASE”).\n​\nAll of our stores have the ability to service professional service provider customers. For this reason, select Team Members in each store complete extensive sales call training with a regional field sales manager. These Team Members then spend at least one day per week calling on existing and potential professional service provider customers. Each Team Member engaged in such sales activities participates in quarterly advanced training programs for sales and business development.\n​\nAdditionally, we have extensive processes in place to specifically identify emerging talent and conduct formalized training focused on leadership development. Store and district managers complete a comprehensive training program to ensure each has a thorough understanding of customer service, leadership, inventory management, and store profitability, as well as all other sales and operational aspects of our business model. Store and district managers are also required to complete a structured training program that is specific to their position, including attending a week-long manager development program at the corporate headquarters in Springfield, Missouri. Store and district managers also receive continuous training through online training programs, field workshops, regional meetings, and our annual leadership conference.\n​\nEngagement and Inclusion:\nAt O’Reilly, we are committed to fostering a culture of engagement and inclusion where every individual’s voice is heard, valued, and respected. We believe in celebrating and embracing the unique perspectives, experiences, and talents that each person brings. We are dedicated to creating an environment that is free from discrimination, harassment, and bias, and where everyone has equal opportunities to thrive and succeed. We are committed to recruiting and building strong teams through our robust processes for talent acquisition, ongoing leadership development, and active identification of emerging talent. We have worked to expand opportunities for all of our Team Members through programs designed to prepare them to take on more responsibilities at every level of the organization. We firmly believe that promoting from within is a differentiator in leveraging Team Member experience and maximizing engagement across the entire Company. In order to ensure our engagement and inclusion efforts are successful, we survey our Team Members, provide enhanced, collaborative learning through training and resources, and build network groups, action plans, and programs aimed at improving our work environments for our Team Members and customers.\n​\nCompensation, Benefits, and Recognition:\nOur compensation philosophy has always been to incentivize Team Members to “run it like you own it,” and we continually evaluate and benchmark our comprehensive compensation programs to ensure they remain competitive, providing an important tool to attract and retain the best and most qualified Team Members in every market. We provide financial incentives to all store Team Members through various incentive compensation programs. Store team members have the opportunity to earn incentive pay that increases their base hourly wage consistent with their individual performance or the performance of their store. Store managers, district managers, region directors, and division vice presidents have the ability to earn additional compensation above their salary or base hourly wage based upon the performance of their stores. In addition, beginning with the district manager level, we augment our competitive programs with share-based compensation. We believe our incentive compensation programs significantly increase the motivation and overall performance of our Team Members.\n​\nJust as pay, benefits, and growth opportunities are critically important to our Team Members’ success, we believe it is equally important to recognize Team Members for a job well done. We regularly present many awards that range from recognizing individual service longevity to performance, allowing peer-to-peer recognition, or management nomination of an individual’s excellent performance. \n​\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n​\n\nTeam Composition:\nWe recognize that each and every one of our Team Members plays a very important role in our ability to provide outstanding customer service and achieve consistent, successful performance. As of January 31, 2025, we employed 93,047 Team Members (78,111 full-time Team Members and 14,936 part-time Team Members), of whom 75,940 were employed at our stores, 12,111 were employed at our DCs, and 4,996 were employed at our corporate and regional offices. Ours is an increasingly technical business creating the need for knowledgeable Professional Parts People, and our ongoing focus on developing a technically proficient Team has resulted in the growth of the mix of our full-time work force, increasing from 65% at January 31, 2020 to 84% at January 31, 2025. While full-time Professional Parts People play a vital role in our ongoing success, the flexibility of incorporating part-time employment into our work force is also an important component of providing excellent customer service. Many of our part-time Team Members choose to work at O’Reilly while attending school, or during other transitional periods in their lives, or simply because of their passion for cars and knowledge of auto parts. Part-time Team Members have the opportunity to become career Professional Parts People because of our “promote from within” philosophy, and many of our leaders today began their careers as part-time Team Members in our stores or distribution centers. \n​\nA union represents 465 Team Members in 49 stores in the Greater Bay Area in California and has for many years. There are 27 Team Members that drive over-the-road trucks in one of our domestic DCs that are also represented by a labor union. Additionally, two unions represent approximately 1,001 Team Members in Mexico and two unions represent approximately 123 Team Members in Canada. We consider our current relationship with these unions and union Team Members to be excellent. With the exception of the previously described Team Members, our Team Members are not represented by labor unions. \n​\nAdditional information about our Team Member population and human capital management practices can be found in our most recent Environmental, Social, and Governance report, which is available on our website at www.OReillyAuto.com. The information available on our website, including our Environmental, Social, and Governance report is not, and will not be deemed to be, a part of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, or incorporated by reference into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n​\nStore Network\n​\nNew Store Site Selection:\nIn selecting sites for new stores, we seek to strategically locate store sites in clusters within geographic areas in order to achieve economies of scale in management, advertising, and distribution. Other key factors we consider in the site selection process are\n\n\n●   population density;\n-----------------------\n\n●   demographics, including age, life style, and per capita income;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   market economic strength, retail draw, and growth patterns;\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   number, age, and percent of makes and models of registered vehicles;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the number, type, and sales potential of existing automotive repair facilities;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the number of auto parts stores and other competitors within a predetermined radius;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   physical location, traffic count, size, economics, and presentation of the site;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   financial review of adjacent existing locations; and\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the type and size of store that should be developed.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n​\nWhen entering new, more densely populated markets, we may, when appropriate, seek to initially open several stores within a short span of time in order to maximize the effect of initial promotional programs and achieve economies of scale. After opening this initial cluster of new stores, we begin penetrating the less densely populated surrounding areas. As these store clusters mature, we evaluate the need to open additional locations in the more densely populated markets where we believe opportunities exist to expand our market share or to improve the level of service provided in high volume areas. This strategy enables us to achieve additional distribution and advertising efficiencies in each market.\n​\nStore Locations and Size:\nAs a result of our dual market strategy, we are able to profitably operate in both large, densely populated markets and small, less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket. Our domestic stores, on average, carry approximately 23,000 SKUs and average approximately 7,800 total square feet in size. At December 31, 2024, we had a total of approximately 49 million square feet in our 6,265 domestic stores. Our stores are served primarily by the nearest DC, which carry over 153,000 SKUs, but also have same-day access to the broad selection of inventory available at one of our 396 Hub \n\n\n10\n\n\n\n​\n\nstores that average 15,900 square feet in size and carry an average of 55,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 107,000 SKUs.\n​\nWe believe that our stores are “destination stores” generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity. Consequently, most of our stores are freestanding buildings or prominent end caps situated on or near major traffic thoroughfares and offer ample parking, easy customer access, and are generally located in close proximity to our professional service provider customers.\n​\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n​\n\nThe following table sets forth the geographic distribution and opening and acquisition activity of our stores as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n          ​             ​     ​      ​       ​       ​     ​      ​          ​          ​          ​       ​     ​     ​      ​       ​     ​      ​       ​

positions, while optimizing our inventory investment by controlling the depth of our store stocked inventory. Our distribution expansion strategy, supported by our ongoing, significant capital investments, complements our new store opening strategy by supporting newly established clusters of stores, and additional penetration into existing markets, in the regions surrounding each DC. \n​\nDistribution Centers:\nAs of December 31, 2024, we operated 31 DCs comprised of approximately 13.1 million operating square feet (see the “Properties” table in Item 2 of this annual report on Form 10-K for more information about DC operating square footage). Our DCs stock over 153,000 SKUs and most DCs are linked to and have access to multiple other DCs’ inventory. Our DCs provide five-night-a-week delivery, primarily via a Company-owned fleet, to substantially all of our stores in the continental United States. In addition, stores within an individual DC’s metropolitan area receive multiple daily deliveries from the DC’s “city counter,” many of which receive this service seven days per week. Our DCs provide service to not only the stores they service via their city counters but also to strategic Hub locations, which redistribute products to surrounding stores. Our national Hub store network provides additional service throughout the week, and on weekends, to surrounding stores.\n​\nAs part of our continuing efforts to enhance our distribution network in 2025, we plan to\n\n\n●   continue to enhance our distribution network through the engineering, design, expansion, or relocation of new or current DCs;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   continue to utilize routing software to enhance logistics efficiencies;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   continue to enhance labor management software to improve DC productivity and overall operating efficiency;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   continue to refine best practices in all DCs and standardize across the network;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   make proven, return-on-investment based capital enhancements to material handling equipment in DCs, including conveyor systems, picking modules, lift equipment, and computer hardware;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   continue to augment our robust distribution network, when and where appropriate, through the use of strategically located Hubs; and\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   invest in our people to continue providing a safe working environment and anchor in our people first and always model.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nHub Stores:\nWe currently operate a total of 396 strategically located Hub stores. In addition to serving DIY and professional service provider customers in their markets, Hub stores also provide delivery service to our other stores within the surrounding area and access to an expanded selection of SKUs on a same-day basis. Our Hub store network consists of 396 Hubs that average approximately 15,900 square feet and carry an average of 55,000 SKUs, with Hubs in select markets carrying further enhanced inventory levels up to approximately 107,000 SKUs.\n​\nProducts and Purchasing\n​\nOur stores offer DIY and professional service provider customers a wide selection of products for domestic and imported automobiles, vans, and trucks. Our merchandise generally consists of nationally recognized, well-advertised, premium name brand products, such as AC Delco, Armor All, Bosch, Castrol, Denso, Dorman, Fel-Pro, Gates Rubber, Lucas Oil, Mobil1, Monroe, NGK, Pennzoil, Prestone, Standard, STP, Turtle Wax, Valvoline, and Wix, and a wide selection of quality proprietary private label products, which span the entire good, better, and best value spectrum, under our BesTest®, BrakeBest®, Cartek®, Import Direct®, MasterPro®, MicroGard®, Murray®, Omnispark®, O’Reilly Auto Parts®, Precision®, PowerTorque®, SuperStart®, Syntec®, and Ultima® brands. Our proprietary private label products are produced by respected automotive manufacturers, meet or exceed original equipment manufacturer specifications, and consist of house brands and nationally recognized proprietary brands, which we have acquired or developed over time. Our “good” proprietary brands provide a great combination of quality and value, a characteristic important to our DIY customers, while our “better” and “best” proprietary brands offer options for our more heavy-duty DIY customers, as well as our professional service provider customers, who often prefer higher quality products that can be relied upon to support and grow their businesses.\n​\nWe have no long-term contracts with material purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, nor have we experienced difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative supply sources for automotive parts. We believe that alternative supply sources exist at competitive costs for substantially all of the automotive products that we sell. It is our policy to take advantage of payment and seasonal purchasing discounts offered by our suppliers and to utilize extended dating terms available from suppliers. We have entered into various programs \n\n\n13\n\n\n\n​\n\nand arrangements with certain suppliers that provided for extended dating and payment terms for inventory purchases. As a whole, we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be very good.\n​\nWe purchase automotive products in substantial quantities from over 645 suppliers, the five largest of which accounted for approximately 26% of our total purchases in 2024. Our largest supplier in 2024 accounted for approximately 8% of our total purchases and the next four largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 3% to 6% of our total purchases.\n​\nMarketing\n​\nRetail and Online Marketing:\nOur integrated marketing strategy and Omnichannel efforts include national media channels, in-store, digital, and social media activation, as well as personalized experiences through e-mail and text messaging and marketing the O’Reilly brand through automotive event sponsorships and on-site appearances throughout the country. Our O’Rewards loyalty program encourages repeat customers, as they accumulate points from their O’Reilly purchases that are redeemable for rewards at various purchase levels. Our marketing efforts also target the Spanish-speaking market through broadcast media, print, and sports marketing, as well as sponsorships of local and regional events.\n​\nProfessional Marketing:\nTo develop our continued relationships with professional service providers and installers, we employ Territory Sales Managers in all major markets to ensure complete sales territory coverage and personalized service for professional customers. Flyers, quick reference guides, and catalogs are distributed on a regular basis to all professional service providers, including paint and body shops and fleet maintenance customers to encourage brand and program awareness. In addition, our professional customer program also offers a proprietary ordering mobile application, business ecommerce platform called www.OReillyPro.com, dedicated Professional Service Specialists in stores, multiple daily deliveries, and access to training opportunities, shop management, maintenance supplies, and the Certified Auto Repair program, which offers professional service providers with the business tools they need to profitably grow and market their business. \n​\nINDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT\n​\nThe automotive aftermarket industry includes all products and services purchased for light and heavy-duty vehicles after the original sale. The total size of the U.S. automotive aftermarket is estimated to be approximately $414 billion, according to the Auto Care Association. This market is made up of four segments: labor share of professional service provider sales, auto parts share of professional service provider sales, DIY sales, and tire sales. We estimate that O’Reilly’s U.S. addressable market within this industry is approximately $150 billion to $160 billion, which includes the auto parts share of professional service provider sales at wholesale and DIY sales at retail. We do not sell tires or perform for-fee automotive repairs or installations. \n​\nCompetition\n​\nThe sale of automotive aftermarket items is highly competitive in many areas, including customer service, product availability, store location, brand recognition, and price. We compete in both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket and are one of the largest specialty retailers within that market. We compete primarily with\n\n\n●   national retail and wholesale automotive parts chains (such as AutoZone, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, CARQUEST, and NAPA);\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   regional retail and wholesale automotive parts chains;\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   wholesalers or jobber stores (some of which are associated with national automotive parts distributors or associations such as NAPA, CARQUEST, Bumper to Bumper, and Auto Value);\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   automobile dealers; and\n---------------------------\n\n●   mass merchandisers and online retailers that carry automotive replacement parts, maintenance items, and accessories (such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc.).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nWe compete on the basis of customer service, which includes merchandise selection and availability, technical proficiency, helpfulness of store personnel, price, store layout, the Omnichannel experience, and convenient and accessible store locations. Our dual market strategy requires significant capital, including the capital expenditures required for our distribution and store networks and working capital needed to maintain inventory levels necessary for providing products to both the DIY and professional service provider portions of the automotive aftermarket.\n​\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n​\n\nInflation and Seasonality\n​\nWe have generally been successful in reducing the effects of merchandise cost increases principally by taking advantage of supplier incentive programs, economies of scale resulting from increased volume of purchases, and selective forward buying. To the extent our acquisition costs increased due to price increases industry wide, we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products. As a result, we do not believe inflation has had a material adverse effect on our operations.\n​\nTo some extent our business is seasonal, primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns. While we have historically realized operating profits in each quarter of the year, our store sales, profits, and inventory levels have historically been higher in the second and third quarters (April through September) than in the first and fourth quarters (October through March) of the year.\n​\nRegulations\n​\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local laws and governmental regulations relating to our business, as well as the health and safety of our Team Members and customers, including, but not limited to, those related to the handling, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances, the recycling of batteries and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property.\n​\nAs part of our operations, we handle hazardous materials in the ordinary course of business and our customers may bring hazardous materials onto our property in connection with, for example, our used oil, oil filter, and battery recycling programs. We currently provide a recycling program for batteries and the collection of used lubricants at certain stores as a service to our customers pursuant to agreements with third-party suppliers. The batteries and used lubricants are collected by our Team Members, deposited onto/in pallets and containers, and then recycled by third-party suppliers. In general, our agreements with such suppliers contain provisions that are designed to limit our potential liability under applicable environmental regulations for any damage or contamination, which may be caused by the batteries and lubricants to off-site recycling properties (including as a result of waste disposal) and to our properties, when caused by the supplier.\n​\nCompliance with any such laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations to date. However, we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur significant expenses in the future in order to comply with any such laws or regulations.\n​\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n​\nBrad Beckham, age 46, Chief Executive Officer, has been an O’Reilly Team Member for 28 years.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n​\nOur future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. Interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements.\n​\nRISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\n​\nDeteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit, and cause our customers and others, with which we do business, to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nAlthough demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers. The economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels, a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic, and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factors are outside of our control. Our customers’ purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or political uncertainty. If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n​\nOverall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors, including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the U.S., the total number of registered vehicles in the U.S., the age and quality of these registered vehicles, and the level of unemployment in the U.S. Changes in vehicle technology used by the original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”) on future vehicles, including but not limited to electric, hybrid, and internal combustion engines, may result in less frequent repairs, parts lasting longer, or elimination of certain repairs. In addition, restrictions on access to telematics, diagnostic tools, and repair information imposed by the OEMs or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs. Adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n​\nIn addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations, and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics, and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities. Furthermore, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may worsen. If third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions, the cause of which could include a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic, and provide us with the merchandise \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n​\n\nwe need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n​\nThe automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nBoth the DIY and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. In addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. Online and mobile platforms may allow customers to quickly compare prices and product assortment and availability between us and a range of competitors, which could result in pricing pressure. Some online competitors may have a lower cost structure than we do, as a result of our strategy of providing an exceptional in-store experience and superior parts availability supported by our extensive store network and robust, regional distribution footprint, which could also create pricing pressure. We may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive and our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected. For a list of our principal competitors, see the “Competition” section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n​\nWe are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales.\nOur business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters. Unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity, and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to DIY customers. Extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts. In addition, our stores and DCs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased unrecoverable losses resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n​\nA change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, the limited supply or unavailability of key products, supply chain disruptions, or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health.\nOur business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. Many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms. For example, financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them. In addition, the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers, as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices. We could also be negatively impacted when our suppliers or our supply chain experiences work stoppages; labor strikes; a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic; shipping and transportation disruptions or increased costs; currency fluctuations or inflation; or other interruptions to, or difficulties in, the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase. If we are unable to effectively respond to such disruptions to our supply chain, or manage them more effectively than our competitors, our business and competitive position may be negatively impacted. In addition, changes in U.S. trade policies, sanctions, practices, tariffs or taxes, import limitations, and other factors relating to foreign trade and port agreements could affect our ability to source products and our suppliers’ ability to source materials or provide products at current volumes and/or prices. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n​\nBusiness interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, stability of systems we rely on, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business.\nBusiness interruptions, including from a prolonged public health crisis or pandemic, weather-related events, terrorist activities, war, political or civil unrest, or other disasters, or the threat of them, may result in a disruption of operations or the closure of one or more of our DCs or other facilities, or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis. This may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty, among other things. Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices. Such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n​\nIn addition, we rely extensively on various systems, some of which are provided by third-party service providers, to manage inventory, process transactions, and timely provide products to our stores and customers. These systems are subject to failure, damage, or interruption, including power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches, or other catastrophic events. If these systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories, deliver product, or process customer transactions. Such a disruption of these systems, \n\n\n19\n\n\n\n​\n\nand the response to remedy, could result in a negative impact on our business operations and increased costs, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n​\nFailure to protect our brand and reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe believe our Company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry. We believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow, and leverage the value of our brand. Our reputation is based, in part, on perceptions of subjective qualities; negative publicity involving the Company, our merchandise or our industry in general that erode customer trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and business. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, health and safety, accounting or environmental standards, or existing or future laws or regulations, as well as failure or perceived failure to achieve or make progress with environmental, social, and governance goals, could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions from consumer or environmental groups, employees, or regulatory bodies, which could require us to incur substantial legal fees and costs. In addition, negative claims or publicity, including the availability of information and opinions on social media, as its impact is immediate, could adversely affect our reputation. The opportunity for the rapid dissemination of information, including inaccurate and inflammatory information and opinions, is virtually limitless and easily accessible. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\n​\nRisks associated with international operations could result in additional costs and inefficiencies.\nIn addition to many of the risks we face in our U.S. operations, international operations present a unique set of risks and challenges, including local laws and customs, various and potentially complex international tax regulations and compliance requirements, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations, and political and socio-economic conditions. Our ability to operate effectively and grow in international markets could be impacted by these risks resulting in legal liabilities, additional costs, and the distraction of management’s attention. Compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and protection of intellectual property rights surrounding items such as tradenames and trademarks in foreign jurisdictions can pose significant challenges.\n​\nIn addition, our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries. Given that our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. As a result, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance.\n​\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\n​\nRisks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price.\nWe believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. We cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts. If we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer.\n​\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation.\nThe stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions and potentially being targeted through the selling and buying of our common stock by a group of individuals, whose interests and reasoning behind such actions may not align with an average market participant. The market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts’ expectations and failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\n​\nIn addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such companies. If similar litigation were initiated against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n​\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n​\n\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING\n​\nOur debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nWe have an unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured commercial paper program, and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences for our financial health. For example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things,\n\n\n●   make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the senior unsecured notes, commercial paper program, and our credit facility;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on our debt, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, or other cash requirements;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   limit our ability to incur additional debt with acceptable terms, if at all; and\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   expose us to fluctuations in interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates to SOFR.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nIn addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, conditions on borrowing, and subsidiary guarantees. A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. The occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n​\nA downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes, as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs.\nCredit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital. These ratings are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength. Our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates. A downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. A downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our unsecured senior notes, preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future. In addition, a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to the supplier financing programs our suppliers participate in at attractive rates. Decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business, adversely affecting our cash flows.\n​\nRISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PRIVACY\n​\nDamage, failure, or interruptions of information technology systems could adversely affect our business operations and results.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed or provided by third-party service providers, to collect, analyze, process, store, manage, transmit, and protect business operations, processes, transactions, and data. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching of these systems, applications, or processes could adversely impact their effectiveness or could expose us to risks. Our systems, and the third-party systems with which we interact, are subject to damage, failure, or interruption due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, power or other critical infrastructure outages; facility damage; physical theft; telecommunications failures; malware; security incidents; cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, spyware, denial of service attacks, and ransomware; natural disasters and catastrophic events; inadequate or ineffective redundancy measures; and design or usage errors by Team Members, contractors, or third-party service providers. Although we seek to effectively maintain and safeguard our systems, and we seek to ensure our third-party service providers effectively maintain and safeguard their systems, such measures are not guaranteed to be successful. As a result, we or our service providers could experience one or more errors, interruptions, delays, or cessations of service impacting the integrity or availability of our information technology infrastructure. A material incident could significantly disrupt our operations and business processes; result in the impairment or loss of critical data; be costly and resource-intensive to remedy; and/or harm our reputation and relationship with customers, Team Members, suppliers, and other stakeholders, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n​\nIn addition, our information technology systems, infrastructure, and personnel require substantial investments, such as replacing systems, maintaining or enhancing systems, or designing or acquiring new systems. These efforts can result in significant potential risks, \n\n\n21\n\n\n\n​\n\nincluding failure of the systems to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data, incurring more costs than expected, or implementation delays or errors, and may result in operational challenges, security control failures, reputational harm, and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n​\nA breach of customer, supplier, Team Member, or Company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or litigation.\nOur business involves the receiving, storage, and transmitting of certain personally identifiable or confidential information about our customers, suppliers, Team Members, and the Company, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and suppliers. We and our third-party service providers and suppliers have taken significant and appropriate steps to protect this information, including maintaining compliance with payment card industry and National Clearing House standards and a security program that includes updating technology and security policies, employee training, and monitoring and routine testing of our systems. However, these security measures are costly and require constant, ongoing attention and may not prevent a security breach due to cyber-attacks, computer malware viruses, exploitation of hardware or software vulnerabilities, Team Member error, malfeasance, system compromises, fraud, hacking, trickery, or other intentional or unintentional acts, which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. There is no guarantee that the security measures that we and our third-party service providers and suppliers have implemented, or will introduce in the future, to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, or provide us with sufficient visibility to determine if data security breaches have occurred. A compromise of our security measures or those of a third-party we entrust could result in information related to our customers, suppliers, Team Members, or the Company being obtained or misused by unauthorized persons; damage to our reputation; adverse operational effects or interruptions; costs to the Company to address the breach, which could require extensive time and financial resources to resolve; or claims, litigation, or possible regulatory action against us, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. \n​\nIn addition, the regulatory environment related to information security and data collection, processing, use, and privacy is complex and constantly evolving. The effects of complying with stricter and more complex data collection, processing, use, and privacy and information security laws, regulations, and standards can be far-reaching and may increase our responsibility and liability, which may increase our costs by needing to invest significant, additional time and resources and make changes to our existing practice and processes. Failure to comply with data collection, processing, use, and privacy and information security laws, regulations, and standards by us or our third-party service providers or suppliers could subject us to fines, sanctions, governmental investigations, lawsuits, or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n​\nGENERAL RISKS\n​\nWe cannot assure future growth will be achieved.\nWe believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. Our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning, and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel, and general business and economic conditions. We cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2025 and beyond will be achieved. Failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. For a discussion of our growth strategies, see the “Growth Strategy” section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n​\nIn order to be successful, we will need to attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees.\nOur success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel. In order to be successful, we will need to attract, retain, and motivate executives and other key employees. Experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. In addition, we compete with other retail businesses to fill many of our hourly positions, which historically have had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market. We must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. Our business, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient, in particular in a significant inflationary wage pressured environment, and, as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability. For a discussion of our management, see the “Business” section of Item 1 of this annual report on Form 10-K.\n​\nRisks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies.\nWe expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. Acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations. Examples of such risks include the following:\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n​\n\n\n●   We may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Our management’s attention may be distracted.\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n●   We may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   We may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   We may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational, and other benefits.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nWe may fail, or be unable, to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we or the subsequent owner or operator may be liable.\n​\nLitigation, governmental proceedings, environmental, employment, and tax legislation and regulations may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, including litigation relating to motor vehicle accidents incurred through the operation of our large vehicle fleet, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business. The damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n​\nEnvironmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries. While it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, new or more stringent climate change-related mandates, laws, or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing mandates, laws, or regulations could potentially be forthcoming. These matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices or requiring additional expenditures by us or our suppliers to comply, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n​\nOur business is subject to employment legislation and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs. Our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as minimum wage legislation. A violation of, or change in, employment legislation and/or regulations could hinder our ability to control costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n​\nNew laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances, including as a result of executive orders, could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, existing laws, statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances, including those related to tax, could be interpreted, changed, modified, or applied adversely to us, which could adversely impact our costs directly or indirectly through our suppliers and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. \n ​",
