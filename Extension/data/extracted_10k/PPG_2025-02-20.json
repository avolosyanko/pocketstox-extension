PPG’s vision is to be the first-choice partner to meet our customers’ evolving needs for innovative paints, coatings and surface solutions to protect and beautify the world.\nPPG has a proud heritage with a demonstrated commitment to innovation, sustainability, community engagement and development of leading-edge paint, coatings and specialty products. Through dedication and industry-leading expertise, we solve our customers’ biggest challenges, collaborating closely to find the right path forward.

The Company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth. We align our product development with the macro trends in the markets we serve, including a focus on sustainability and productivity, and leverage core technology platforms to develop products to address unmet market needs. Additionally, we operate laboratories in close geographic proximity to our customers, and we customize our products for our customers' end-use applications. Our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management. We have obtained government funding for a small portion of the Company’s research efforts, and we will continue to pursue government funding, where appropriate.\nWe own and operate several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes. In addition to the Company’s centralized principal research and development centers (see Item 2. “Properties” of this Form 10-K), operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence. As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively, we operate global competitive sourcing laboratories. Because of our broad array of products and customers, we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform.\nRaw Materials, Energy and Logistics\nPPG uses a wide variety of complex raw materials that serve as the building blocks of our manufactured products. The Company’s most significant raw materials include resins, solvents, reactants, titanium dioxide, additives and epoxy. Raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide. Raw materials represent PPG’s single largest production cost component.\nMost of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and continues to make, supply arrangements to meet our planned operating requirements for the future. Supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts with multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. In support of our decarbonization efforts, we continue to increase the amount of renewable energy secured for our operating facilities, and we are increasingly evaluating alternative raw materials that offer sustainable benefits and support the circular economy, including recycled and renewable feedstocks. Prices for certain of our raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices and global supply and demand changes; however, pricing may be impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil, natural gas, and other key feedstocks.\nThrough effective management of raw materials, energy and logistics, the Company aims to maintain a competitive cost position and ensure ongoing security of supply. Security of a sufficient supply of high-quality raw materials is important to PPG’s continued success as it allows the Company to increase production as necessary to keep pace with customer demand. While PPG faced certain raw material shortages and logistical challenges during 2021 and 2022, raw material and logistics availability improved in 2023 and 2024 and is now comparable to pre-pandemic conditions. We continue to focus on improving our competitive cost position and expanding our supply of high-quality raw materials, including strategic initiatives to qualify multiple sources of supply.\nWe typically experience fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, government regulation, tariffs, and global supply and demand factors. In 2024, raw material costs remained high compared to historic levels, but moderated compared to 2022 levels, resulting in a low single-digit percentage decrease to cost of goods sold compared to 2023. The Company expects raw material costs to increase by a low single-digit percentage during 2025, primarily due to already enacted tariffs.\nWe are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the regulation and registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes. Our ongoing, global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards. We anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally, and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations.\nOur commitment to sustainability extends to our suppliers as an extension of our internal focus on sustainability. The PPG Global Supplier Code of Conduct clarifies our global expectations in the areas of business integrity, labor practices, associate health and safety, and environmental management. Our Supplier Sustainability Policy builds upon our Global Supplier Code of Conduct by establishing expectations for sustainability within our supply chain. These policies reinforce \n2024 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 7\n\n\nour expectations that our suppliers, as well as their subcontractors, will comply fully with applicable laws and adhere to internationally recognized environmental, social and corporate-governance standards.\nGlobal Operations\nPPG has significant non-U.S. operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance to us of economic impacts occurring in any one region of the world. As a result of our global footprint, we are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets, trade protection measures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2024, unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased Net sales by approximately $70 million and Income before income taxes by approximately $20 million.\nRefer to Note 20, “Revenue Recognition” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional geographic information pertaining to sales and Note 21, “Reportable Business Segment Information” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for geographic information related to PPG’s property, plant and equipment.\nSeasonality \nPPG’s Income before income taxes has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and Cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to end-use market seasonality, primarily in our architectural coatings and traffic solutions businesses. Demand for our architectural coatings in Europe and traffic solutions products in the U.S and Canada is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement, maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months. The Latin American paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter. These cyclical activity levels result in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher Cash from operating activities.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, PPG employed approximately 46,000 people, of which approximately 11,700 were in the United States and approximately 34,300 were elsewhere in the world. The Company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world. We observe local customs, laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements. There were no significant work stoppages in 2024. While we have experienced occasional work stoppages and may experience some work stoppages in the future, we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms. To date, these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on our results of operations. Overall, we believe we have good relationships with our employees.\nThe PPG Way is a set of behaviors that enables, empowers and engages each employee to fully live our values and realize our full potential as an organization. It guides our employees and leaders as we strive to achieve our purpose of protecting and beautifying the world. Employee engagement is a measure of the extent to which our employees are involved in, enthusiastic about, and committed to our work and workplace. We conduct employee surveys to increase dialogue among teams and implement meaningful action to improve results. \nOur human capital management strategies provide the foundation for our teams to thrive and deliver exceptional performance. These strategies in the areas of culture and purpose, employee engagement, development and pay equity are overseen by the Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. We are committed to ensuring our employees are safe, healthy, enabled, engaged and valued for the unique talents they bring to PPG. We believe that having quality dialogue with our people, recognizing the value they bring and championing an authentic culture generates engaged employees and a company that is more innovative, productive and competitive. Our focus on and investment in learning and development are crucial to ensuring we keep our people engaged, productive and successful at every stage of their careers. We are committed to promoting from within wherever possible while also bringing in new ideas, thoughts and insights. \nOne of PPG’s greatest strengths is our people. Their talents and unique perspectives enable us to meet challenges quickly, creatively and effectively, providing a significant competitive advantage in today’s global economy. To ensure our people feel valued and respected, we are committed to providing a workplace that embraces a culture of collaboration and is free from harassment and bullying.\nOur environmental, health and safety policy and standards define our expectations, and we implement programs and initiatives to reduce health and safety risk in our operations. We measure progress against our health and safety goals using the injury and illness rate, which is calculated as the number of illness and injury incidents per 200,000 work hours. For 2024, our injury and illness rate was 0.31.\nMore information about PPG’s human capital management strategies and our workforce can be found in the Proxy Statement for our 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and in our Sustainability Report located at http://sustainability.ppg.com.\n2024 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 8\n\n\nEnvironmental Matters\nPPG is committed to operating in a sustainable and productive manner and to helping our customers meet their sustainability goals. Our sustainability efforts are overseen by the Sustainability and Innovation Committee of our Board of Directors. At the management level, day-to-day implementation of our sustainability initiatives is led by our Vice President, Global Sustainability who coordinates PPG’s sustainability programs, integrates these programs into our business and communicates the benefits of our sustainably advantaged products to our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. The Vice President, Global Sustainability works with PPG’s Sustainability Committee, a committee of management consisting of senior corporate executives, to establish and monitor our sustainability goals, policies, programs and procedures that incorporate sustainability into our business practices, including resource management, innovation, community engagement, communications, procurement, manufacturing and employee wellness. \nOur dedication to innovation is intertwined with sustainability. In 2024, PPG continued to innovate and deliver sustainably-advantaged solutions based on our customers’ desire to improve their productivity and to reduce overall value chain environmental impacts. Our products contribute to lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles, airplanes and ships, and they help our customers reduce their energy consumption, conserve water and reduce waste. These products include compact automotive paint processes and low temperature cure capabilities that save energy and reduce water usage at customer manufacturing sites; sustainably-advantaged waterborne coatings formulations; sustainably-advantaged powder coatings; lightweight sealants and coatings for aircraft; coatings that cool surfaces; coatings for recyclable metal packaging; antimicrobial products; coatings that contain reduced materials of concern; architectural coatings that contain lower carbon content raw materials; and solutions for autonomous and battery-powered vehicles. For the year ended December 31, 2024, 41% of sales were from sustainably-advantaged products and processes that we have defined as addressing multiple sustainability benefits, including lower emissions, lower toxicity, energy efficiency, use of renewable raw materials or extending durability.\nPPG is committed to using resources efficiently and driving sustainability throughout our entire value chain, including continued focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, water withdrawal and total energy use. In 2023, PPG announced its near-term 2030 sustainability goals, including greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions targets that have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. PPG’s 2030 sustainability goals include a commitment to reduce absolute emissions from its own operations (scope 1 and 2) by 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, processing of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products by 30% within the same timeframe. \nWe are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned, relative to environmental matters, within the industries in which it operates. PPG is negotiating with various government agencies concerning current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations, including certain sites on the National Priority List. While PPG is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations, each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability. Generally, however, a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site. There is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites, due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation. The Company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.\nOur experience to date regarding environmental matters leads us to believe that we will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites. Management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time.\nIn addition to the $222 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately $100 million to $200 million. These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually significant. The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.\nManagement believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Refer to Note 15, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs.\n2024 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 9\n\n\n\n($ in millions)                                                     2024   2023                2022             \nCapital expenditures for environmental control projects          $24                  $26                 $21   \nWe believe that the amount spent on capital expenditures for environmental control projects in 2025 will be similar to 2024.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAs a global manufacturer of paints, coatings and specialty products, we operate in a business environment that includes risks. Each of the risks described in this section could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and liquidity. While the factors listed here are considered to be the more significant factors, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles which may adversely affect our businesses and our results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nEconomic Risks\nIncreases in prices and declines in the availability of raw materials could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur financial results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials. Raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide. These raw materials represent PPG’s single largest production cost component. Most of our raw materials are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. Adequate supply of critical raw materials is managed by establishing contracts, procuring from multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. While not our customary practice, we also import raw materials and intermediates, particularly for use at our manufacturing facilities in the emerging regions of the world. In most cases, those imports are priced in the currency of the supplier and, therefore, if that currency strengthens against the currency of our manufacturing facility, our margins may be lower. \nThe Company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to effectively broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. These initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, within Asia and other lower cost regions of the world, diversification of our resin supply, including adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations, and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide and certain other raw materials used in our product formulations. \nPPG continues to undertake actions to maintain supply arrangements adequate to meet planned operating requirements. However, raw material supply chain disruptions, including logistical and transportation challenges, could adversely impact our ability to procure raw materials. An inability to obtain certain critical raw materials has adversely impacted our ability to produce certain products in the past and could do so in the future. Additionally, the cost of raw materials fluctuates due to a number of factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, government regulation, tariffs, and global supply and demand factors, any of which could drive an increase in raw material costs. If raw material costs increase and we are unable to offset these higher costs in a timely manner, this would adversely impact Income from continuing operations and Cash from operating activities.\nThe pace of economic growth and level of economic and geopolitical uncertainty could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our products and services depends, in part, on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past and may do so in the future. There is a high level of uncertainty surrounding future global economic conditions due to a number of factors, including the impact of higher interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, including the international impacts of the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Israel and increasing tensions between China and the United States, commodity market volatility, potential changes to international trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs and the threat of additional tariffs, \n2024 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 10\n\n\nand labor shortages in certain regions of the world. PPG provides products and services to a variety of end-use markets in many geographies. This broad end-use market exposure and expanded geographic presence lessens the significance of any individual decrease in activity levels; nonetheless, lower demand levels may result in lower sales, which would adversely impact Income from continuing operations and Cash from operating activities.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate during each reporting period, as well as assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies will affect our Net sales, Net income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. We may use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to foreign currency transactions. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, could adversely or positively affect our financial condition and results of operations which are expressed in U.S. dollars.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive.\nWith each of our businesses, an increase in competition may cause us to lose market share or lose customers, adversely impacting our sales volumes, or compel us to reduce prices to remain competitive, which could result in reduced margins for our products. Additionally, our ability to increase prices may impact the overall economics for the products we offer. Competitive pressures may not only reduce our margins but may also impact our revenues and our growth which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nPublic health crises, including pandemics and the measures taken by public health and government authorities to address them, have adversely impacted our financial condition and results of operations in the past, and could adversely impact us in the future.\nOur financial condition, liquidity and results of operations were adversely impacted by public health crises in the past, including impacts from efforts by public health officials to contain the public health crises. The effects of public health crises could interfere with the ability of PPG, our suppliers, our customers, and others to conduct business and negatively affect consumer confidence and the global economy. Preventative and protective actions taken by public health officials, governments and PPG in response to public health crises could adversely impact our business, suppliers, distribution channels, and customers, due to business shutdowns, reduced workforce availability, reduced ability to supply products, or reduced demand for our products. \nLegal, Regulatory, and Tax Risks\nWe are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations control, among other things, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the handling, use, treatment, storage and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater affected by hazardous substances. In addition, various laws regulate health and safety matters. The environmental laws and regulations we are subject to impose liability for the costs of, and damages resulting from, cleaning up current sites, past spills, disposals and other releases of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws and regulations can also result in fines and penalties. Future environmental laws and regulations, including rules requiring expanded reporting of certain environmental, safety and governance information, may require substantial capital expenditures or may require or cause us to modify or curtail our operations, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, and we may be involved in future lawsuits and claims, in which substantial monetary damages are sought.\nPPG is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims, both actual and potential, in which substantial monetary damages are sought. Those lawsuits and claims may relate to contract, patent, environmental, product liability, asbestos exposure, antitrust, employment, securities and other matters arising out of the conduct of PPG’s current and past business activities. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management’s attention and resources. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential claims, and the levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses. We believe that, in the aggregate, the outcome of all current lawsuits and claims involving PPG, including those described in Note 15, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, will not have a material effect on PPG’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. Nonetheless, the results of any future litigation or claims are \n2024 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 11\n\n\ninherently unpredictable, and such outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, Cash from operating activities or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, which could increase our compliance costs and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of complex U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, environmental laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, and laws governing improper business practices, including bribery. We are affected by new laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations, as well as interpretations by courts and regulators. These laws and regulations effectively expand our compliance obligations and costs.\nFor example, regulations concerning the composition, use and transport of chemical products continue to evolve. Developments concerning these regulations could potentially impact the availability or viability of some of the raw materials we use in our product formulations and/or our ability to supply certain products to some customers or markets. Import/export sanctions and regulations also continue to evolve and could result in increased compliance costs, slower product movements or additional complexity in our supply chains.\nFurther, although we believe that we have appropriate risk management and compliance programs in place, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from improper acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or businesses that we acquire. Any non-compliance, improper actions or allegations of such could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations and shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory costs.\nChanges in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to various taxes in both the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has proposed modernizing international tax rules, including global minimum tax standards (referred to as Pillar 2), which has caused an increase to our effective tax rate. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, the introduction of new taxes and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. If our effective income tax rate were to increase, our Cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. Although we believe that our tax filing positions are appropriate, the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If future audits find that additional taxes are due, we may be subject to incremental tax liabilities, possibly including interest and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our Cash from operating activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational and Strategic Risks\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results.\nPPG has a significant investment in global operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. Notwithstanding the benefits of geographic diversification, our ability to achieve and maintain profitable growth in international markets is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries. As a result of our operations outside the U.S., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including political and economic uncertainty, inflation rates, exchange rates, trade protection measures, local labor conditions and laws, restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of earnings, and weak intellectual property protection. Recently, there has been an increase in global geopolitical uncertainty due to a number of factors, including the international impacts of the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Israel and increasing tensions between China and the United States. In 2024, PPG completed the divestiture of its U.S. and Canada Architectural Coatings business, which further increases the percentage of sales recognized outside the U.S. During 2024, approximately 68% of the Company’s total net sales were recognized outside of the United States.\nBusiness disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nUnexpected events, including supply disruptions, temporary plant and/or power outages, work stoppages, natural disasters and severe weather events, significant public health issues, computer system disruptions, challenges implementing, upgrading or transitioning enterprise resource planning systems, fires, war or terrorist activities, could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise harm the operations of PPG, our customers and our suppliers. It is not possible for us to predict the occurrence or consequence of any such events. However, such events could reduce our \n2024 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 12\n\n\nability to supply products, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible for us to receive raw materials from suppliers or to deliver products to customers.\nThe security of our information technology systems could be compromised which could adversely affect our operations or reputation. \nWe rely extensively on global information technology systems, networks and services, certain of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to conduct our business. We use information technology systems, networks, and services throughout many of our key business processes, including, but not limited to, receiving customer orders, purchasing materials, producing inventory, shipping inventory to customers, collecting customer payments, and paying our employees and vendors.\nNumerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent threats and ransomware, pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and services, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. The techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks evolve rapidly, including from emerging technologies such as advanced automation or artificial intelligence and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. As a result we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. Our information technology systems, networks and services have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to cybersecurity attacks. We have implemented and operate a cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our networks and systems as well as information that we own or is in our care. Notwithstanding our cybersecurity preparedness activities, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party service providers will prevent all cybersecurity events. A material cybersecurity event could result in negative publicity, theft or other financial loss, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, theft of personally identifiable information, and/or production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not effectively integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations.\nGrowth through acquisitions is an important component of the Company’s strategy. Over the last decade, we have successfully completed more than 50 acquisitions, and we will likely acquire additional businesses and enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Growth through acquisitions and the formation of joint ventures involve risks, including:\n•difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and products into our existing business;\n•delays in realizing the benefits from the acquired companies or products;\n•diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns;\n•difficulties due to lack of or limited prior experience in any new markets we may enter;\n•unforeseen claims and liabilities, including unexpected environmental exposures, product liability, or existing information technology vulnerabilities;\n•unexpected losses of customers or suppliers of the acquired or existing business;\n•difficulty in conforming the acquired business’ standards, processes, procedures and controls to those of our operations; and\n•difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses.\nThese risks or other challenges encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and joint ventures could cause delays in realizing the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures, or such anticipated benefits may never be realized, which could adversely affect our results of operations, Cash from operating activities or financial condition.\nOur ability to understand our customers’ specific preferences and requirements, and to innovate, develop, produce and market products that meet customer demand is critical to our business results.\nOur business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. To achieve our business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to customers. This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs. \nWe believe the automotive industry will experience significant and continued change in the coming years, including an increase in the production of electric vehicles. Vehicle manufacturers continue to develop new safety features such as collision avoidance technology and self-driving vehicles that may reduce vehicle collisions in the future, potentially lowering demand for our automotive refinish coatings. In addition, through the introduction of new technologies, new \n2024 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 13\n\n\nbusiness models or new methods of travel, such as ridesharing, the number of automotive OEM new-builds may decline, potentially reducing demand for our automotive OEM coatings and related automotive parts.\nPPG is committed to developing and selling sustainably-advantaged products, which are designed to help our customers achieve their sustainability goals, including by reducing the amount of materials used in their processes. We expect that our focus on sustainably-advantaged products will drive future sales growth; however, as customers transition to sustainably-advantaged products, this could adversely impact our sales volumes as customers may require a lower quantity of our products due to reduced customer waste, extended durability and other similar impacts of using our sustainably-advantaged products.\nAdditionally, the development of customer-facing digital channels has and will continue to transform certain retail industries. An inability to develop such solutions and our customer’s pace of adoption of those solutions could negatively affect our business or the market demand for our products. We manage our innovation pipeline and introduction of new products through a rigorous stage gate process. We continuously look at ways to optimize and improve the effectiveness of this process to deliver innovation and growth.\nOur future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate our existing products and to develop and introduce new products. If we fail to keep pace with product innovation on a competitive basis or to predict market demands for our products, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business success depends on attracting, developing and retaining a qualified workforce.\nOur continued business success depends on the efforts and abilities of our management team and employees. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel in a highly competitive labor market, and we may face challenges attracting or retaining qualified employees. If we are unable to effectively attract, develop and retain a qualified workforce, our businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPPG’s aerospace coatings business depends, in part, on our ability to successfully meet customer demand, production targets and commitments.\nPPG is currently under contract to supply transparencies, coatings and sealants for use on existing and new commercial, general aviation and military aircraft manufactured by many of the largest global and regional aerospace manufacturers. Our aerospace business is currently experiencing a backlog resulting in product shortages to certain of our customers. In addition, many of our contracts contemplate production increases over the next several years. If we fail to meet production targets and commitments, or encounter difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels, it could have a material effect on our reputation, business, operating results, or financial condition. Similarly, to the extent demand for our products increases rapidly and significantly in future periods, we may not be able to ramp up production quickly enough to meet the demand, which could result in production delays at our customers, lost opportunities for growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position. Additionally, delivery delays by us due to production interruptions or delays may subject us to liability from customer claims that such delay resulted in losses to the customer.",
