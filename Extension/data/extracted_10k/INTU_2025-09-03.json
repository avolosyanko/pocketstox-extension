We reincorporated in Delaware and completed our initial public offering in March 1993. Our principal executive offices are located at 2700 Coast Avenue, Mountain View, California, 94043, and our main telephone number is 650-944-6000. When we refer to “we,” “our,” or “Intuit” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation (Intuit Inc.) and its California predecessor, as well as all of our consolidated subsidiaries.\nOur Business Portfolio\nWe organize our businesses into four reportable segments:\n\nGlobal Business Solutions(1): This segment serves small and mid-market businesses around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. QuickBooks and Intuit Enterprise Suite are offerings powered by our all-in-one business platform which includes financial management services, human capital management solutions such as payroll and time tracking, money solutions, such as merchant payment processing, bill pay, checking accounts through an FDIC-member bank partner, and financing for small and mid-market businesses. Intuit Enterprise Suite provides mid-market businesses with a configurable, AI-powered solution that includes multi-entity and multi-dimensional financial management capabilities designed to seamlessly scale and enhance productivity and profitability for more complex businesses to streamline operations. Mailchimp offerings include marketing automation and customer relationship tools.Consumer: This segment primarily serves consumers, helping customers get their taxes done with confidence—whether they do it themselves or with the help of an AI-enabled human expert. TurboTax delivers do-it-yourself and assisted income tax preparation products and services sold in the United States (U.S.) and Canada.Credit Karma: This segment serves consumers with a personal finance offering that helps members find the right financial products and make smarter money decisions throughout the year to reach their financial goals. This includes personalized recommendations for credit card, home, auto, and personal loan, and insurance products; online savings and checking accounts through an FDIC-member bank partner; and access to their credit scores and reports, credit and identity monitoring, credit report dispute, credit building tools, and tools to help understand net worth and make financial progress.

Our professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada.      \n(1) On August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nOur Business and Growth Strategy\nThe era of AI is igniting global innovations at an incredible pace and will fundamentally transform every part of our work and personal lives. We made an early bet on AI, declaring our AI-driven expert platform strategy in 2019. We have transformed the company from a tax and accounting platform to an AI-driven expert platform. We have a significant competitive advantage with our scale of data, data services, AI capabilities, ecosystem of applications, and our large network of AI-enabled human experts to become the all-in-one platform for consumers, businesses, and accountants. We're disrupting the categories we operate in to drive better money outcomes for our customers. \nWe leverage AI and human intelligence to provide our customers with done-for-you experiences that automate tasks, identify actionable insights to drive important decisions, and manage end-to-end workflows or entire processes to eliminate work, while ensuring the customer remains in control. When customers need additional help or want help to complete the work on their behalf, we connect them with the best human expert from our network of thousands of AI-enabled financial, tax, and bookkeeping experts who can complete a specific task, address specialized questions, or manage the entire workload. Our strategy, combined with our Big Bets that focus on the largest customer problems and growth opportunities, positions us for durable growth. \nIn fiscal 2025, we launched a transformative set of AI agents that provide customers with a virtual team to complete jobs on their behalf, dramatically improving how businesses run and grow. Combined with our AI-enabled human experts, these agents are automating workflows and delivering real-time insights to drive growth and improve cash flow. Our redesigned user interface and new business feed highlights these real-time insights and recommendations and the tasks completed by agents on behalf of the customer. We also launched AI agents in Intuit Enterprise Suite, including accounting, payments, finance, and project management agents, transforming how our small and mid-market business customers manage their finances by automating a variety of day-to-day tasks, and increasing productivity.\nOur innovation has been possible with the investments in our proprietary Generative AI Operating System (GenOS), which have enabled us to fuel innovation with unparalleled speed for our customers. Built for our internal developers, GenOS not only keeps pace with rapid technological industry advances but is setting the pace—by melding the best of artificial intelligence and human intelligence on our platform. This enables us to rapidly deliver a new class of intelligent, autonomous financial solutions that will define the next decade of growth for our customers and for Intuit. Our AI-driven expert platform and products are built in keeping with the company’s commitment to data privacy, security, and responsible AI governance. We safeguard customer data and protect privacy using industry-leading technology and practices, and adhere to responsible AI principles that guide how we operate and scale our platform with our customers’ best interests in mind. \nAs we execute our global AI-driven expert platform strategy, we prioritize resources on our Big Bets across the company. We have driven significant momentum across the company over the past year. Looking ahead, we are doubling down on the areas that drove strong results this year where the combination of AI and human intelligence delivers done-for-you experiences, helps customers put more money in their pockets, and builds our mid-market business.\nAs the external environment evolves, we continue to innovate and adapt our strategy and anticipate our customers’ needs. For more than 40 years, we have been dedicated to developing innovative solutions that are designed to solve our customers' most important financial problems. At Intuit, we believe that everyone should have the opportunity to prosper, and we never stop working to find new, innovative ways to make that possible.\n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES      \nDuring fiscal 2025, we offered our products and services in the four segments described in “Our Business Portfolio” above. The following table shows the percentage of total revenue contributed by each of these segments over the last three fiscal years. \n\n                                     Fiscal 2025                Fiscal 2024                Fiscal 2023\nGlobal Business Solutions               59     %                   59     %                   56     %\nConsumer                                26     %                   27     %                   29     %\nCredit Karma                            12     %                   10     %                   11     %\nProTax                                   3     %                    4     %                    4     %\nTotal international net revenue was approximately 8% of consolidated total net revenue in each of the twelve months ended July 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023.\nFor financial information about our reportable segments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nGlobal Business Solutions\nOur Global Business Solutions segment serves small and mid-market businesses around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. Our vision is to be the connected all-in-one platform with a virtual team of AI agents and AI-enabled human experts that small and mid-market businesses rely on every day to run and grow their businesses.\nSmall and mid-market business owners are constantly faced with challenges and barriers in their journey to success. Universally, businesses at every stage of growth struggle to get customers, pay and get paid, get capital, manage their workforce, get access to advice, and stay compliant. Our all-in-one platform features AI agents, providing actionable, AI-driven insights and automation to help our customers grow and run their businesses with confidence. These AI agents are also able to work alongside our large network of AI-enabled human experts to provide businesses with additional expertise and support.\nGet Customers \nMailchimp.

Our full range of merchant services for small and mid-market businesses includes credit card, debit card, Apple Pay, and ACH payment services for in-person and card-not-present payments. We offer instant deposit and payment dispute protection options for eligible customers. Through seamless onboarding and automated transaction reconciliation, our payment processing solutions are deeply integrated into our QuickBooks Online, Desktop, and Intuit Enterprise Suite offerings.\nQuickBooks Checking. The QuickBooks Checking business bank account comes with a physical and virtual debit card for more spending power, fast payments with no-fee Instant Deposit, and powerful cash flow management with envelopes for partitioning funds for future expenses, all with no fees.\nBill Pay. Our QuickBooks Online offerings and Intuit Enterprise Suite allow small and mid-market businesses to organize bills and make payments online. Small and mid-market businesses can connect with vendors and automatically import bills through our network, resulting in easier and faster payments.\nGet Capital\nCapital. We offer financing options for small and mid-market businesses to help them get the capital they need to succeed. The financing process provides customers with the ability to use their QuickBooks data to qualify to borrow capital, whether from Intuit via our originating bank partner or from partners on our QuickBooks Capital Marketplace. Additionally, QuickBooks Line of Credit provides flexible access to capital through pre-approved credit limits. Qualified small and mid-market businesses can choose to borrow funds through a series of term loans within a maximum approved credit limit.\nManage Their Workforce\nWorkforce Solutions. Our payroll solutions, available as online or desktop solutions, are sold on a subscription basis and integrate with our QuickBooks Online and Desktop offerings and Intuit Enterprise Suite, or may be purchased standalone. Our online payroll offerings include automated tax payments and filings, as well as access to human resources solutions and employee benefits offerings such as health insurance and 401(k) plans. We also offer time tracking solutions, which seamlessly integrate with our online payroll offerings to help businesses easily and accurately track time for their mobile workforce, including tools for project planning, job costing, and tracking billable hours per client.\nAccess Advice\nQuickBooks Live. Businesses can get support through Expert Assisted and Full-Service Bookkeeping. With QuickBooks Live Expert Assisted, businesses have on-demand access to expert bookkeepers who can provide guidance and support on managing their books and making smart business decisions.

These offerings are available either online or as desktop versions in the U.S. and Canada. They are designed to be easy to use yet sophisticated enough for complex tax returns, serving the varied needs of our customers, from those who file simple returns to those who itemize deductions, own investments or rental property, and manage small and mid-market businesses. \nOur do-it-yourself tax products and services are designed for customers who choose to independently prepare and file their tax returns. Our assisted tax products and services, such as TurboTax Live and TurboTax Live Full Service, are designed for customers who seek professional tax advice or who want their returns prepared by an expert. We also offer complementary services, including electronic filing of federal and state income tax returns, faster access to tax refunds, audit defense, and audit support.\nOur online tax preparation, filing, and other services are offered through the websites and mobile apps of thousands of financial institutions, electronic retailers, and other online merchants. Financial institutions can offer our online tax preparation and filing services to their customers through a link to TurboTax Online. \nCredit Karma\nOur Credit Karma segment provides consumers with a financial platform that propels them forward wherever they are on their financial journey, enabling them to understand their financial picture, make smart financial decisions, and stick to their financial plan. The platform offers a number of services to our members: access to their credit scores and reports, credit and identity monitoring, credit building, credit report dispute, tools to help understand net worth and make financial progress, personalized recommendations of credit card, loan, and insurance products, and access to our TurboTax offerings, including tax preparation software and early tax refunds.

Additionally, Credit Karma leverages Lightbox, a first-of-its-kind enterprise platform which allows lenders to leverage thousands of de-identified data points from Credit Karma members to help provide our members with greater certainty that they will be approved if they apply for a financial product. \nProTax\nOur ProTax segment includes our professional tax offerings and serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings consist of Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada. These offerings enable accountants to accurately and efficiently complete and electronically file a full range of federal and state tax returns for individuals and businesses. Lacerte is designed for full-service, year-round accounting firms who handle more complex returns. ProSeries is designed for year-round tax practices handling moderately complex tax returns.

To succeed in these markets, continuous investment is required to innovate, develop new products and services, and enhance existing offerings. Our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy.\nWe develop many of our products and services internally, and we have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring businesses and technologies. We also purchase or license products and technology from third parties and establish other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy.\nOur offerings have rapid development cycles. In addition, developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements, and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project.\nWe continue to make substantial investments in research and development. We expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with done-for-you experiences, financial recommendations, personalization, and ease of use enabled by AI and other advanced technologies. We continue to focus on developing new products and services, including global offerings, and undertaking significant research and development for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings.\n\nSEASONALITY    \nOur Consumer and ProTax offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically heavily concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively. \nWe expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProTax businesses to continue to have a material impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.\n\nMARKETING, SALES, AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS     \nMarkets \nOur primary customers are consumers and small and mid-market businesses. We also provide specialized tax and accounting products to professional accountants. We partner with financial institutions and other partners, who we connect with consumers on our platform. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. The widespread usage of mobile devices and social media, along with the evolution of AI, has accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized how customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services.\nReal-time, personalized online shopping experiences are the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, and other changes in the way we do business.\nMarketing Programs\nWe use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales, develop leads, increase general awareness of the Intuit brand and our product portfolio, and drive sales in retail. These programs include offline marketing, such as TV and radio advertising; digital marketing, such as display and pay-per-click advertising, search and generative engine optimization, and social and affiliate marketing; email marketing; in-product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services; public relations; \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nsponsorships; podcast marketing; mobile marketing; and retail marketing of our consumer tax offerings. Our campaigns are designed to attract new users, retain existing users, and cross-sell additional offerings.\nSales and Distribution Channels\nDirect Channel. We offer our products and services directly through our websites, apps, and call centers. Direct online offerings are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase and other decisions regarding our and our partners’ offerings based on content provided on our websites, or via other online content and word-of-mouth recommendations. For many of our products, assisted sales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers who want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on accountants, bookkeepers, and marketing professionals, and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our business and professional tax solutions. We market certain products directly to mid-market businesses through our direct sales force. \nMulti-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences. Our customers primarily research products and services online. Many customers buy and use our products and services entirely online. Some research online but make their purchase at a retail location. Because many customers shop across multiple channels, we continue to coordinate our online, offline, and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated, multi-channel shop-and-buy model. We also focus on cross-selling complementary Intuit and third-party offerings online and in-product.\nOnline App Stores. We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices.\nPartner and Other Channels. We offer many of our products and services through partners and other channels, including value-added resellers, technology partners with complementary platforms, accountants, bookkeepers, marketing professionals, and professional service providers who help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. These partners combine our products and services with marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. We also sell our TurboTax Desktop offerings at retail locations across the U.S. and Canada and on retailer websites. In Canada, we also rely on distributors who sell products into the retail channel.\n\nCOMPETITION    \nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our businesses across all of our offerings. Competition is rapidly evolving, fragmented, and involves complex interdependencies with many businesses. Competitive pressures in many of the market segments we serve have grown markedly over the past few years, and the marketing and distribution channels continue to evolve. We expect these trends to continue. Our competitors may introduce superior products and services, successfully use and deploy new technologies such as AI that may reduce customer demand for our products or services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing, and other resources, have greater brand recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers and partners, advertise aggressively, or beat us to market with new products and services.\nThe competitive landscape is constantly evolving. This occurs as we expand into new market segments and geographic regions and extend our capabilities, as well as when new companies emerge or existing companies extend their capabilities (either directly or through acquisitions or partnerships) to include the market segments and geographic regions in which we operate. Given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global financial technology company and the customer problems that we aim to solve, we compete with offerings from a variety of organizations across a range of industries, including large global companies, smaller geographically focused companies, startups, and professional services. Entities that offer or provide access to offerings that we may compete with include:\n•business software providers, including industry-specific vertical software providers and embedded software providers, that offer solutions such as accounting, business management and financial software, marketing automation, customer relationship management, inventory management, payroll and workforce management;\n•private and publicly-funded tax preparation and filing service providers, including embedded software providers;\n•accounting, consulting, and tax firms; \n•companies and banks that provide money services, including merchant payment processing, bill pay, checking and savings accounts, financing and point of sale devices; \n•companies that provide personal finance management products and tools, including access to credit scores, credit and identity monitoring, credit-building tools, and tools to help understand net worth and make financial progress;\n•companies that provide a marketplace of consumer financial offerings;\n•financial institutions; \n•credit bureaus; and\n•platform companies that could develop competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face.\nWe believe our most important competitive factors are our innovation and technology capabilities, functionality, ease of use, and security of our offerings, the integration of our offerings with each other and third-party offerings, brand recognition and reputation, quality of support, and cost. We believe that we compete favorably based on these factors and our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance. \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\n\nCUSTOMER SUCCESS     \nFor many of our offerings, we provide support through multiple channels including telephone, email, online and video chat, text messaging, our customer support websites, self-help assets embedded in our products, and online communities where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other.\nWe also provide access to experts, through our TurboTax and QuickBooks Live offerings, who provide tax advice, tax preparation, and bookkeeping services.\nOur customer success staff predominantly consists of Intuit-employed and outsourced experts. We supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch. We augment the services we provide with outsourced partnerships domestically and internationally. A majority of our outsourced customer success personnel are based domestically, with additional international teams located primarily in the Philippines and Canada.\nWe also source staff through our Prosperity Hub program, which is designed to spark economic prosperity in underserved communities. One part of this program is our socially responsible sourcing model, where we both directly and through customer success partner-employers, hire, train, and retain workers who deliver support and services for our customers.\nSelf-help information is offered for free in-product and on our support websites for many of our offerings. Support alternatives and fees vary by product. For example, some product subscriptions receive 24/7 support and additional contact channel options.\n\nMANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION      \nOnline Products and Services\nOur online offerings include QuickBooks Online, Intuit Enterprise Suite, online payroll services, merchant payment processing and bill pay services, Mailchimp’s marketing automation and customer relationship offerings, TurboTax Online, ProConnect Tax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, and Credit Karma offerings. We use public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, for most of our systems, networks, and databases used to operate these online offerings.\nDesktop Software and Supplies\nOur desktop software customers generally electronically download software as demand for physical packaged products has declined. When supplies are ordered, we typically ship the physical product within a few days of receiving an order, and backlog is minimal.\n\nPRIVACY AND SECURITY    \nWe host, collect, process, use, and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal data from our customers, users, workforce, and third-party partners. We are stewards of this data and have designed data stewardship principles to align our organization in collecting, using, and protecting such information. As we believe strongly in these principles, we operate our program to comply with laws and regulations that govern our use, sharing, and protection of personal information, including, for example, laws related to financial services and the handling of tax data. We have established guidelines and practices to help ensure members of our workforce are aware of our program and the role they play in protecting this data. Our privacy statements provide notice of our privacy practices, and provide the opportunity for impacted parties to exercise their rights with respect to their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to inform public policy for privacy and security. \nWe use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information that is given to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration. We use technical and procedural measures designed to help detect and prevent fraud and misuse of data. Whenever sensitive information, such as credit card information or tax return data, is transmitted to us through one of our websites or products, we follow current industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us, and when we store it at rest. We routinely patch our systems with security updates and work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products, as well as internally developed technology, security procedures, and practices.\n\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION      \nWe are subject to federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations that add compliance costs, affect how we operate, and may impact our ability to compete. For example, our Consumer and ProTax segments are subject to federal, state, and international government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. Our Global Business Solutions segment offers products and services to small and mid-market businesses and consumers, such as payroll, payments, financing for small and mid-market businesses, and other financial service offerings, which are also subject to certain regulatory \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nrequirements. Our Credit Karma segment offers personal finance products and services to consumers, such as recommendations of credit card, loan, and insurance products and access to credit scores and reports, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements. For additional information regarding the government regulations to which we are subject, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, including without limitation the risks under “Legal and Compliance Risks.” \n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY      \nOur success depends on the proprietary technology integrated into our offerings. We protect this proprietary technology through a variety of intellectual property mechanisms, including copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, we regularly file applications for patents, copyrights, and trademarks and service marks to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to Intuit’s overall competitive advantage, although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time. We also have a number of registered trademarks that include Intuit, QuickBooks, Lacerte, TurboTax, QB, ProSeries, ProConnect, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp. We have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. Most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.\nWhile our portfolio of patents is growing, our issued patents could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction. In addition, third parties have asserted and may continue to assert infringement claims against us and our customers. These claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages. Litigation, even if without merit, could result in substantial costs and divert resources and management attention. Additionally, third-party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\n\nHUMAN CAPITAL     \nWe consider our employees to be one of our four key True North stakeholders because they are critical to delivering for our customers, our shareholders, and the communities we serve. As of July 31, 2025, we had approximately 18,200 employees in seven countries. During fiscal 2025, we employed on average approximately 12,300 seasonal employees from January to April primarily to support our Consumer segment customers during the peak of tax season. We believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce in all areas of our business. \nIntuit’s Chief People & Places Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, manages our overall workforce policies and strategies, including employee recruitment, workplace environment and culture, engagement and retention, leadership development, succession planning, organization and talent assessment, fair pay, and executive compensation. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight of these programs.\nCulture and Values\nTo deliver on our mission to power prosperity around the world, we are guided by our company values as we strive to create an inclusive, safe, and respectful workplace where employees can do the best work of their lives and be empowered to make an impact, learn and grow, and feel connected. Our values and culture are woven into our hiring and retention practices and are foundational to our ability to attract, retain, and advance top talent.\n•Our value of Integrity Without Compromise means valuing trust above all else, speaking the truth, and doing the right thing even when no one is looking.\n•Our value of Courage means being bold and fearless in how we think and act, holding a high bar for performance, and valuing speed with a bias for learning and action. \n•Our value of Customer Obsession means falling in love with our customers’ problems and delivering solutions that delight our customers.\n•Our value of Stronger Together means we champion an inclusive and respectful workplace, and we thrive on diverse voices to challenge and inform decisions.\n•Our value of We Care and Give Back means we strive to be stewards of the future, strengthen the communities around us, and give everyone the opportunity to prosper. We provide eligible full-time employees paid time off that can be used to do volunteer work during normal work hours for vetted non-profits and for donation matching up to an annual limit.\nTalent Acquisition\nWe have a robust talent acquisition process that begins with cross-functional talent planning to define hiring needs. Candidates are assessed against skills and values as defined by each hiring team. We are an equal opportunity employer and make employment decisions without regard to any basis protected by federal, state, or local law. We do not make \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nemployment decisions based on an individual’s identity. To expand our reach for the best available talent, we have invested in external partnerships with organizations and universities. This includes active participation and having a significant presence at prominent industry conferences and events known for attracting global audiences with varied skills and experience.\nTalent Development and Retention \nWe strive to create an inclusive, safe, and respectful environment that enables our employees to do the best work of their lives. We provide resources that help them make a positive impact, continue to learn, grow professionally, and feel connected to our culture. We promote the development of all of our employees and provide them with access to learning and training based on their needs and interests and the resources they need to grow, thrive, and reinvent themselves over time. We offer learning programs throughout the employee lifecycle, beginning with onboarding and continuing with ongoing career growth programs. We focus on internal mobility, helping our people acquire new skills, take on new responsibilities, and gain new experiences. This approach contributes to our success in serving our customers while helping our employees achieve their individual professional development and other career goals.\nWe are also invested in growing the capabilities of our managers and developing the leadership skills of our executives. Our teams design programs and resources, such as the Intuit Leadership Playbook, focused on leading with a clear vision, building a high-performance culture, and driving winning results for all of our stakeholders.\nAll full-time employees have access to opportunities to develop and learn through company-sponsored learning paths and online courses on topics ranging from AI to accelerating velocity, in support of an employee’s ability to adapt to any work environment.\nEmployees set goals and measure progress through our goal setting tool and have opportunities to focus on growth both during performance assessment conversations and ongoing regular check-ins with their manager.\nEmployee Engagement and Listening\nListening and responding to our employees is at the core of our culture. We value employee feedback and leverage it to continuously improve the employee experience. We regularly collect, analyze, measure, and share insights about the sentiment of our workforce through multiple channels, including surveys, town halls with senior leadership, and other touchpoints, which help to guide the work we do to support our employees.\nTotal Rewards \nOur compensation philosophy aims to attract and retain top talent for today and the future. Intuit’s total target compensation includes base pay, a range of incentive plans that vary based on role, and stock-based awards — all set at market-competitive levels. Incentive compensation plans are part of our pay-for-performance philosophy, including close alignment with Company performance that rewards top performers. Most employees are eligible for stock-based awards, allowing the majority of our employees to share in the Company’s success.\nWe also offer eligible employees a broad range of competitive benefit programs and services designed to address the physical and mental health, well-being, income protection, and family care needs of employees and their family members. These programs include health care, mental health coaching and counseling, programs to save for retirement, tuition assistance, financial counseling, life and family support programs, and paid time off, including annual paid recharge days and family and parental leave.\nWe have a strong culture of transparency, which includes our ongoing focus on fair pay. We are committed to providing fair pay to all of our employees. We regularly examine our performance evaluation practices, including improving practices to ensure equal opportunity for high-performing employees to be promoted.\nStronger Together\nAt the foundation of our culture is our Stronger Together value. It guides our behavior and interactions in everything we do and in how we treat one another. We serve diverse customers around the world. We believe we can solve their toughest problems and deliver unrivaled benefits when our workforce understands and reflects our customers. \nIntuit has established employee resource groups (ERGs) that provide a foundation for a culture of inclusion. These ERGs are employee-driven, volunteer-led, and open to all employees. ERGs offer a sense of community and give all employees the chance to learn from role models, peers, and experts, and to volunteer within their communities, all while aligning with our organization’s overall vision. \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS     \nThe following table shows Intuit’s executive officers and their areas of responsibility as of August 1, 2025.

      "text": "\nITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS     \nOur businesses routinely encounter and address risks, many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. Below, we describe material factors, events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, categorized solely for ease of reference as strategic, operational, legal and compliance, and financial risks, and which you should consider carefully in evaluating our business. The following events and consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, reputation and credit rating, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Some of the factors, events, and uncertainties discussed below may have occurred in the past. However, these disclosures are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events, or uncertainties have occurred in the past, instead they reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events, or uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect us in the future. We could also be affected by other events, factors or uncertainties that are presently unknown to us or that we do not currently consider to present significant risks to our business. These risks may be amplified by the effects of global developments and conditions or events, including macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, which have caused significant global economic instability and uncertainty. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nWe face intense competitive pressures that may harm our operating results.\nWe face intense competition in all of our businesses, and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. Our competitors and potential competitors range from large and established entities to emerging start-ups. Our competitors may introduce superior products and services, successfully use and deploy new technologies such as AI that may reduce customer demand for our products or services, reduce prices, have greater technical, marketing and other resources, have greater name recognition, have larger installed bases of customers, have well-established relationships with our current and potential customers and partners, advertise aggressively or beat us to market with new products and services. In addition, we face competition from existing companies with large established consumer user bases and broad-based platforms, who may change or expand the focus of their business strategies and marketing to target our customers, including small businesses, tax and personal financial management customers.\nWe also face competition from companies with a variety of business models and monetization strategies, including increased competition from providers of free and low cost offerings, particularly in our tax, accounting, payments and consumer finance platform businesses. We have also introduced free offerings in several categories, but we may not be able to attract and retain customers as effectively as our competitors with different business models. In addition, other providers of free offerings may provide features that we do not offer and customers who have formerly paid for our products and services may elect to use our competitors’ free offerings instead. These competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, and harm our ability to acquire and retain customers.\nOur consumer tax business also faces significant, increasing competition from the public sector, where we face the risk of federal and state taxing authorities implementing revenue-raising strategies that involve developing and providing government tax software or other government return preparation systems at public expense. These or similar programs have been and may continue to be introduced or expanded in the future, which may change the voluntary compliance tax system in ways that could cause us to lose customers and revenue. For example, the IRS made available a free direct filing system and has stated it will explore ways to expand eligibility for the program, including partnering with more states. Additionally, the legacy IRS Free File Program enables the IRS to offer free commercial tax software directly to qualifying taxpayers, and taxpayer adoption of this program could expand with increased awareness of and government support for the program.\nThrough these or other programs, federal and state governments are or could become publicly funded direct competitors of the U.S. tax services industry and of Intuit. Government funded services that curtail or eliminate the role of taxpayers in preparing their own taxes could potentially have material and adverse revenue implications on us.\nFuture revenue growth depends upon our ability to adapt to technological change and successfully extend our platform, introduce new and enhanced products, features, services and business models.\nWe operate in industries that are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. To meet the evolving needs and expectations of our customers and partners and attract and retain top technical talent, we must continue to innovate, develop and extend our platform, introduce new products, services, and features, and enhance our ability to anticipate and solve new and existing customer problems, including with emerging technologies, such as AI. If we are not able to do this successfully, we may face a competitive disadvantage and our business could be harmed. We have and will continue to devote significant resources to continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, including AI. There can be no assurance that we or our customers will realize the expected benefits from these investments. Legislation or regulatory changes in these areas may mandate changes in our products that make them less attractive to users and hinder our ability to leverage emerging technologies and build out our platform capabilities. \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nOur consumer and professional tax businesses depend significantly on revenue from customers who return each year to use our updated tax preparation and filing software and services. They include customers who use our free consumer tax products and whose tax scenarios evolve in subsequent years to require paid services. Encouraging continued use of our offerings in successive years can become increasingly difficult if customers do not perceive our offerings to provide continuing or meaningfully incremental value. The growth of our business depends, in part, on our ability to successfully provide customers value in this way. In addition, when customers consent to the use of their data across our platform, we work to provide additional benefits to them through our existing offerings and through the development of new offerings. Our inability to demonstrate value of any of these offerings to existing customers may negatively impact our ability to build new data-driven offerings and our revenue. \nWe may expend a significant amount of resources and management attention on offerings that do not ultimately succeed in their markets. We have encountered difficulty in launching new offerings in the past. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new offerings may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. We have also invested, and in the future, expect to invest in new business models, technologies, geographies, strategies and initiatives. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including a rapidly changing regulatory environment, diversion of management’s attention from current operations, expenses associated with the initiatives, inadequate return on investments, and social or ethical scrutiny. Because these new initiatives are inherently risky, they may not be successful and may harm our financial condition, operating results, or reputation.\nWe rely on intellectual property in our products and services.\nMany of our products and services utilize our own intellectual property, as well as the intellectual property of third parties, which we license under agreements that may need to be renewed or renegotiated from time to time. We may not be able to obtain licenses to these third-party technologies or content on reasonable terms, or at all, in the future. If we are unable to obtain the rights necessary to use certain intellectual property in our products and services, we may not be able to provide the affected offerings, and customers who are currently using the affected product may be disrupted, which may in turn harm our future financial results, damage our brand, and result in customer loss. Also, we and our customers have been and may continue to be subject to infringement claims as a result of the third-party intellectual property incorporated in our offerings, including through our use of AI. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted against us, it could require us to pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our services, require us to change our products, technology, or business practices, or require our compliance with other unfavorable contractual terms. Even if we are not ultimately liable for any potential infringement, pending claims require us to use significant resources, require management attention and could result in loss of customers.\nSome of our offerings include third-party software that is licensed under “open source” licenses, some of which may include a requirement that, under certain circumstances, we make available, or grant licenses to, any modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software. Our established internal review and approval processes may not mitigate these risks, and we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products. Our inability to mitigate the risks associated with the usage of open source software may harm our business.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, domain names and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures and contractual restrictions. However, the efforts that we take to protect our proprietary rights, including through litigation, monitoring, and enforcement programs, may not always be sufficient or effective. We often observe unauthorized copies of our software being sold through online marketplaces, and despite our effort to implement technical countermeasures, we expect piracy to continue to remain a persistent problem that results in lost revenue and increased expenses. In addition, there is uncertainty about the validity and enforceability of intellectual property rights that may result from our use of GenAI. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming and may not be successful in every location. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our brand, and our ability to compete.\nOur business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.\nDeveloping and maintaining awareness of our brands and platform strategy is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and services and is an important element in attracting new customers and expanding our business with existing customers. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events, activities, or views attributed to us, members of our workforce or Board of Directors, agents, third parties we rely on, or our users, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Perceived social harm or unfairness of outcomes relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. Our brand value also depends on our ability to provide secure and trustworthy products and services, as well as our ability to protect and use our customers’ data in a manner that meets their expectations. In addition, a security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers’ sensitive data could cause material reputational harm. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products or \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nservices and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce our stock price.\nOur efforts related to environment, social, and governance matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.\nEnvironmental, social and governance matters continue to be an area of focus for shareholders, regulators, customers, employees, and other stakeholders. Our efforts and reporting on these matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation, operations, and performance. This could happen if we fail, or are perceived to fail, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations or varying state or federal regulatory requirements, or to uphold or achieve our public commitments. Standards and best practices for tracking and reporting these matters continue to evolve and we may not be able to implement new and changing standards and best practices in ways that meet the varied expectations of all of our stakeholders. Any of the foregoing may also expose us to increased scrutiny from stakeholders and negatively impact demand for our products, our ability to attract and retain talent or our relationships with customers, suppliers or other stakeholders. \nOur acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products, technologies and talent that complement our strategic direction, both in and outside the United States. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n•inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology, data assets and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures;\n•inability to realize synergies or anticipated benefits within the expected time frame or at all;\n•disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n•challenges retaining the key employees, customers, resellers and other business partners of the acquired operation;\n•the internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards or with regulatory requirements, and may require significant time and resources to align or rectify;\n•unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, security policies, standards, and practices, intellectual property issues and legal contingencies;\n•failure to successfully further develop an acquired business or technology and any resulting impairment of amounts currently capitalized as intangible assets; \n•risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\n•in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and\n•to the extent we use debt to fund acquisitions or for other purposes, our interest expense and leverage will increase significantly, and to the extent we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share will be diluted.\nWe have divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with our strategic direction or growth targets. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n•inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms;\n•failure to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to buyers;\n•requirements that we retain or indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations;\n•the possibility that we will become subject to third-party claims arising out of such divestiture;\n•challenges in identifying and separating the intellectual property, systems and data to be divested from the intellectual property, systems and data that we wish to retain;\n•inability to reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business; \n•challenges in collecting the proceeds from any divestiture; \n•disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; \n•loss of key employees who leave us as a result of a divestiture; and\n•if customers or partners of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, or the new owners do not handle the customer data with the same level of care, our other businesses may be adversely affected, to the extent that these customers or partners also purchase other products offered by us or otherwise conduct business with our retained business.\n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nIn addition, any acquisition or divestiture that we announce may not be completed if closing conditions are not satisfied. Evolving regulatory expectations and changes in the political environment may make it more challenging to obtain any required regulatory approval. Because acquisitions and divestitures are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition. In particular, if we are unable to successfully operate together with any company that we acquire to achieve shared growth opportunities or combine reporting or other processes within the expected time frame or at all, there may be a material and adverse effect on the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition, and we could experience additional costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, adverse changes in market conditions and other factors, including those listed above, may cause an acquisition to be dilutive to Intuit’s operating earnings per share for a period of time. Any dilution of our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share could cause the price of shares of Intuit Common Stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nSecurity incidents, improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers’ data, or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition.\nWe host, collect, use and retain large amounts of sensitive and personal customer and workforce data, including credit card information, tax return information, bank account numbers, credit report information, login credentials and passwords, personal and business financial data, transaction records, social security numbers and payroll information, as well as our confidential, nonpublic business information. The significant resources we expend to implement security protections designed to shield this data against potential theft and security incidents cannot provide absolute security.\nOur technologies, systems, and networks have been subject to, and are increasingly likely to continue to be the target of, cyberattacks, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, worms, social engineering, malicious software programs, insider threats, denial-of-service attacks and other cybersecurity threats that have in the past, and could in the future, result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, use, loss or destruction of sensitive and personal data of our customers and our workforce, or Intuit's sensitive business data or cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our data, software, and systems. Cybersecurity incidents can be caused by malicious third parties, acting alone or in groups, or more sophisticated organizations, including nation-states or state-sponsored organizations, and the risks could be elevated in connection with significant armed conflicts, acts of war or terrorism. Customers who fail to update their systems, continue to run software that we no longer support, fail to install security patches on a timely basis or inadequately use security controls create vulnerabilities and make it more difficult for us to detect and prevent these kinds of attacks. Further, we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products, and there may be vulnerabilities in open source software that make it susceptible to cyberattacks. In addition, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information change frequently and, as technologies like AI develop rapidly, malicious third parties are using these technologies to create new sophisticated attack methods that are increasingly automated, targeted and coordinated and more difficult to defend against. We have been and may in the future be a more frequent target of cyberattacks because cyber-criminals tend to focus their efforts on well-known offerings that are popular among customers and hold sensitive personal or financial information.\nFurther, the security measures that we implement may not be able to prevent unauthorized access to our products and our customers’ account data. Malicious third parties have in the past, and may in the future, be able to fraudulently induce members of our workforce, customers, vendors, partners, or users by social engineering means, such as email phishing, to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may occur due to inadequate use of security controls by our customers or our workforce. Accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data. Unauthorized persons could gain access to customer accounts if customers do not maintain effective access controls of their systems and software. Inadvertent exposure of data or access to our systems may also be caused by members of our workforce, including by their error or use of AI.\nCriminals may also use stolen identity information obtained outside of our systems to gain unauthorized access to our customers’ data. We have experienced such instances in the past and as the broader accessibility of stolen identity information increases, we may experience further instances of unauthorized access to our systems through the use of stolen identity information of our customers or our workforce in the future. Further, our customers may choose to use the same login credentials across multiple products and services unrelated to our products. Such customers’ login credentials may be stolen from products offered by third-party service providers unrelated to us and the stolen identity information may be used by a malicious third party to access our products, which could result in disclosure of confidential information. In addition, our hybrid workplace model, where our workforce spends a portion of their time working away from our offices, increases the potential for attacks and adds operational complexity that exacerbates our security-related risks.\nFurther, because we have created an ecosystem where customers can have one identity across multiple Intuit products, a security incident may give access to increased amounts of customer data. From time to time, we detect, or receive notices from customers or public or private agencies that they have detected, actual or perceived vulnerabilities in our infrastructure, our software or third-party software components that are distributed with our products or fraudulent activity by unauthorized persons utilizing our products with stolen customer identity information. The existence of such vulnerabilities or fraudulent activity, even if they do not result in a security breach, may undermine customer confidence as well as the confidence of government agencies that regulate our offerings. Such perceived vulnerabilities could also seriously harm our business by tarnishing our reputation and brand and limiting the adoption of our products and services and could cause our stock price to \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\ndecline. In some cases, such vulnerabilities may not be immediately detected, which could exacerbate the risk of a security incident and the related effects on our businesses.\nWhile we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities described herein. The occurrence of any of the foregoing may result in disclosure of confidential information, loss of customer confidence in our products, possible litigation, material harm to our reputation and financial condition, disruption of our or our customers’ business operations, and a decline in our stock price.\nAdditionally, our use of Credit Karma member data is subject to an order issued in 2014 by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that, among other things, requires maintenance of a comprehensive security program relating to the development and management of new and existing products and services and biennial independent security assessments for 20 years from the date of the order. Our failure to fulfill the requirements of the FTC’s order could result in fines, penalties, enforcement inquiries, investigations and claims, and negatively impact our business and reputation.\nA cybersecurity incident affecting the third parties we rely on could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information and significantly damage our reputation. \nWe depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners who are critical to our business. We or our customers may grant access to customer data to these third parties to help deliver customer benefits, or to host certain of our and our customers' sensitive and personal data. In addition, we share sensitive, nonpublic business information (including, for example, materials relating to financial, business and legal strategies) with other vendors in the ordinary course of business.\nIt is possible that malicious third parties may misrepresent their intended use of data or may circumvent our controls, resulting in accidental or intentional disclosure or misuse of our customer or workforce data, despite our efforts to conduct background checks of our workforce, conduct reviews of partners, developers, and vendors and use commercially available technologies to limit access to systems and data. Further, while we conduct due diligence on the security and business controls of our third-party partners, we may not have the ability to effectively monitor or oversee the implementation of these control measures. Malicious third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business controls or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist in these controls, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or workforce information and data. In addition, malicious actors may attempt to use the information technology supply chain to compromise our systems by, for example, introducing malware through software updates. This risk is exacerbated with the advancement of technologies like AI, which malicious third parties are using to create new, sophisticated and more frequent attacks on our third-party partners. \nA security incident involving third parties we rely on may have serious negative consequences for our businesses, including disclosure of sensitive customer or workforce data, or confidential or competitively sensitive information regarding our business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data; make our products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity; cause temporary or sustained unavailability of our software and systems; result in possible litigation, fines, penalties and damages; result in loss of customer confidence; cause material harm to our reputation and brands; lead to further regulation and oversight by federal or state agencies; result in an adverse financial condition; and result in a reduced stock price.\nConcerns about the broader cybersecurity environment could deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services and damage our reputation.\nThe continued occurrence of cybersecurity incidents affecting governments, businesses, and consumers in general indicates that we operate in an external environment where cybersecurity incidents are increasingly more common and frequent. If the global cybersecurity environment worsens, and there are increased instances of security breaches of third-party offerings where consumers’ data and sensitive information is compromised, consumers may be less willing to use online offerings, particularly offerings like ours in which customers often share sensitive financial data. Additionally, political uncertainty and military actions may subject us and our service providers to heightened risks of security incidents. In addition, the increased availability of data obtained as a result of cybersecurity incidents affecting third-party offerings could make our own products more vulnerable to fraudulent activity. Even if our products are not affected directly by such incidents, any such incident could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from adopting our products and services or lead customers to cease using online and connected software products to transact financial business altogether.\nIf we are unable to effectively combat the increasing amount and sophistication of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties, we may suffer losses, which may be substantial, and lose the confidence of our customers and government agencies and our revenues and earnings may be harmed.\nMany of the industries in which we operate have been experiencing an increasing amount of fraudulent activities by malicious third parties, and those fraudulent activities are becoming increasingly sophisticated, including through the use of AI. We have been and may from time to time become targeted by such malicious third parties engaging in fraudulent activities. Any such fraudulent activities may adversely impact our business, and the risk is heightened when our workforce is working away from our offices under our hybrid work model. In addition to any losses that may result from such fraud, which may be substantial, a loss of confidence by our customers or by governmental agencies in our ability to prevent fraudulent activity may seriously harm our business and damage our brand. If we cannot adequately combat such fraudulent activity, governmental authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to offer the affected services, or these services may otherwise be adversely impacted, which could include federal or state tax authorities refusing to allow us to process our customers’ tax returns electronically, resulting \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nin a significant adverse impact on our business, earnings, and revenue. As fraudulent activities become more pervasive and increasingly sophisticated, our fraud detection and prevention measures, and the teams that create and maintain them, must become correspondingly more sophisticated to combat them across the various industries in which we operate. Accordingly, we have implemented and may continue to implement risk control mechanisms that could make it more difficult for legitimate customers to obtain and use our products. These control mechanisms could result in lost revenue and negatively impact our earnings.\nIf we fail to process transactions effectively or fail to adequately protect against disputed or potential fraudulent activities, our business may be harmed.\nOur operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis, especially in our money and personal financial management businesses. It is possible that we may make errors or that funds may be misappropriated due to fraud despite our efforts to ensure that effective processing systems and controls are in place to handle transactions appropriately. The likelihood of any such error or misappropriation is magnified as we increase the volume and speed of the transactions we process. If we are unable to effectively manage our systems and processes, or if there is an error in our products, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our reputation, the willingness of customers to use our products, and our financial results. In our payments processing service business, if a disputed transaction between a merchant and its customer is not resolved in favor of the merchant, we may be required to pay those amounts to the payment or credit card network and these payments may exceed the amount of the customer reserves established to make such payments.\nBusiness interruption or failure of our information technology and communication systems may impair the availability of our products and services, which may damage our reputation and harm our future financial results.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our customers is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure. As we continue to grow our online services, we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communications systems and those of our external service providers, including, for example, third-party Internet-based or cloud computing services. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. We have designed a significant portion of our software and computer systems to utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by public cloud providers. If any public cloud service that we use is unavailable to us for any reason, our customers may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features, which could significantly impact our operations, business, and financial results.\nFailure of our systems or those of our third-party service providers may result in interruptions in our service and loss of data or processing capabilities, all of which may cause a loss in customers, refunds of product fees, material harm to our reputation and operating results.\nOur tax businesses must effectively handle extremely heavy customer demand during critical peak periods. We face significant risks in maintaining adequate service levels during these peak periods when we have historically derived a substantial portion of our overall revenue from the tax businesses. Any interruptions in our online tax preparation or electronic filing service at any time during the tax season, particularly during a peak period, could result in significantly decreased revenue, lost customers, unexpected refunds of customer charges, negative publicity and increased operating costs, any of which could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on internal systems and external systems maintained by manufacturers, distributors, and other service providers to take and fulfill customer orders, handle customer service requests and host certain online activities. Any interruption or failure of our internal or external systems may prevent us or our service providers from accepting and fulfilling customer orders or cause company and customer data to be unintentionally disclosed. Our continuing efforts to upgrade and expand our network security and other information systems as well as our high-availability capabilities are costly, and problems with the design or implementation of system enhancements may harm our business and our results of operations.\nOur business operations, information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, effects of climate change, human error, malicious attacks, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malware, computer denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, public health emergencies and other events beyond our control. For example, we operate under a hybrid workplace model where our workforce spends a portion of their time working in our offices and a portion of their time working away from our offices. This model has introduced risks of disruptions to our operations, which may impair our ability to perform critical functions or could make it considerably more difficult to develop, enhance and support our products and services.\nIn addition, since our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major seismic faults, our recovery in the event of a major earthquake or other catastrophic event may require us to expend significant time and resources and may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Further, the adverse effects of any such adverse event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event. In the event of a major natural or man-made disaster, our insurance coverage may not completely compensate us for our losses and our future financial results may be materially harmed.\n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nWe regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems and software platforms. Should our investments not succeed, or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems and software platforms disrupt our operations, our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on our network infrastructure, data hosting, public cloud, and software-as-a-service providers, and internal technology systems for many of our development, marketing, operational, support, sales, accounting, and financial reporting activities. We are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet existing needs, as well as the growing and changing requirements of our business and customers. If we experience prolonged delays or unforeseen difficulties in updating and upgrading our systems and architecture, we may experience outages, defects or other performance problems, and may not be able to deliver certain offerings or develop new offerings and enhancements that we need to remain competitive. Such improvements and upgrades are often complex, costly, and time consuming. In addition, such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems, or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems. Unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in outages, disruption in our business operations, loss of revenue, or damage to our reputation.\nIf we are unable to develop, manage and maintain critical third-party business relationships, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur growth is increasingly dependent on the strength of our business relationships and our ability to continue to develop, manage and maintain new and existing relationships with third-party partners. We rely on various third-party partners, including software and service providers, platforms, suppliers, credit reporting bureaus, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, accountants, contractors, financial institutions, core processors, licensing partners and development partners, among others, in many areas of our business in order to deliver our offerings and operate our business. Credit Karma generates revenue from its relationships with financial institutions and other partners, which are subject to particular risks that affect their willingness to offer their products on Credit Karma's platform, such as adverse economic conditions, evolving limitations on their capacity to offer products on the platform, the introduction of competing products on their platforms, and an increasing complexity in the regulatory environment. We also rely on third parties to support the operation of our business by maintaining our physical facilities, equipment, power systems and infrastructure. In certain instances, these third-party relationships are sole source or limited source relationships and can be difficult to replace or substitute depending on the level of integration of the third party’s products or services into, or with, our offerings and/or the general availability of such third party’s products and services. In addition, there may be few or no alternative third-party providers or vendors in the market. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately retain third-party contractors engaged to help us operate our business.\nIn particular, we have relationships with banks, credit unions and other financial institutions that support certain critical services we offer to our customers. If macroeconomic conditions or other factors cause any of these institutions to fail, consolidate, stop providing certain services, impose new or higher costs for certain services, or institute cost-cutting efforts, or give rise to speculation relating to such events, it may be more difficult to offer, if at all, those services to our customers, in which case our business and financial results may suffer. For example, if one of the counterparty financial institutions with whom we have significant deposits were to become insolvent, placed into receivership, or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover our assets from such counterparty may be limited, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the business operations of our third-party partners and the third-party partners who support them have been and could continue to be disrupted, including as a result of major technical outages, uncertain macroeconomic conditions, such as trade wars, and global health crises, such as pandemics and endemics. If our third-party partners are unable to help us operate our business or prevent us from delivering critical services to our customers or accepting and fulfilling customer orders, our business and financial results may be negatively impacted. The failure of third parties to provide acceptable and high quality products, services and technologies or to update their products, services and technologies may result in a disruption to our business operations and our customers, which may reduce our revenues and profits, cause us to lose customers and damage our reputation. Alternative arrangements and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or we may experience business interruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.\nAs we cannot control the day-to-day practices of our suppliers and business partners, we cannot ensure their compliance with the law and our policies regarding workplace and employment practices, data use and security, environmental compliance, intellectual property licensing, and other applicable regulatory and compliance requirements. Any violation of laws or implementation of practices regarded as unethical could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation.\nWe increasingly utilize the distribution platforms of third parties like Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store for the distribution of certain of our offerings, benefiting from the strong brand recognition and large user base of these distribution platforms to attract new customers. However, the platform owners have wide discretion to change the pricing structure, terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other developers. Any adverse changes by these third parties could adversely affect our financial results.\nCompetition for our key employees is intense and we may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our strategic objectives.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled employees, including members of our executive team and individuals in technical and other key positions. Experienced individuals with expertise in software as a \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nservice, financial technology, mobile technologies, data science, AI, and cybersecurity are in high demand. We have faced and will continue to face intense competition globally to attract and retain a diverse workforce with these and other skills that are critical to our success. This is especially the case in California and India where a significant number of our employees are located. In cases where existing employees cannot be effectively developed to meet evolving business needs, our ability to attract and retain top-tier talent becomes even more important. The compensation and incentives we have available to attract, retain and motivate employees may not meet the expectations of current and prospective employees as the competition for talent intensifies. For example, our equity awards may become less effective if our stock price decreases or increases at a slower rate than our talent competitors. In addition, our ability to issue significant additional equity to attract or retain employees may be limited by the risks of dilution to our existing stockholders and the related increase in our expenses. We may experience higher compensation costs to retain and recruit senior management and highly-skilled employees that may not be offset by improved productivity or revenue. Other factors may make it more challenging for us to continue to successfully attract, retain and develop key employees. \nUncertainty in the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence in our platform and products and by our customers may result in harm to our business and reputation. \nWe continue to build and invest in systems and tools that incorporate AI technologies, including GenAI for customers, experts, and our workforce. We also use third parties to support this work. As with many innovations, AI presents risks, uncertainties, and challenges that could adversely impact our business. The development, adoption, and use for GenAI technologies are still in their early stages, and ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Intuit or third-party developers or vendors could result in unintended consequences. For example, AI algorithms that we use may be flawed or may be based on datasets that are biased or insufficient. In addition, any latency, disruption, or failure in our AI systems or infrastructure could result in delays or errors in our offerings. Developing, testing, and deploying resource-intensive AI systems may require additional investment and increase our costs. There also may be real or perceived social harm, unfairness, or other outcomes that undermine public confidence in the use and deployment of AI. In addition, third parties may deploy AI technologies in a manner that reduces customer demand for our products and services. Any of the foregoing may result in decreased demand for our products or harm to our business, results of operations or reputation. \nThe legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain including in the areas of intellectual property, cybersecurity, and privacy and data protection. In addition, there is uncertainty around the validity and enforceability of intellectual property rights related to our use, development, and deployment of AI. Compliance with new or changing laws, regulations, or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs and may limit our ability to develop, deploy, or use AI technologies. Failure to appropriately respond to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and reputational harm.\nIf we experience significant product accuracy or quality problems or delays in product launches, it may harm our revenue, earnings and reputation.\nOur customers rely on the accuracy of our offerings. All of our tax products and many of our non-tax products have rigid development timetables that increase the risk of errors in our products and the risk of launch delays. Our tax preparation software product development cycle is particularly challenging due to the need to incorporate unpredictable, ambiguous, and potentially late tax law and tax form changes each year and because our customers expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of these products to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline. Due to the complexity of our products and the condensed development cycles under which we operate, our products have in the past, and may contain in the future unexpected errors that could interfere with the operation of the software or result in incorrect calculations. The complexity of the tax laws on which our products are based may also make it difficult for us to consistently deliver offerings that contain the features, functionality and level of accuracy that our customers expect. When we encounter problems, we may be required to modify our code, work with state tax administrators to communicate with affected customers, assist customers with amendments, distribute patches to customers who have already purchased the product and recall or repackage existing product inventory in our distribution channels. If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our products either late in our development cycle or after release, it may cause us to delay our product launch date or suspend product availability until such issues can be fixed. Any major defects, launch delays or product suspensions may lead to loss of customers and revenue, negative publicity, customer and employee dissatisfaction, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, and increased operating expenses, such as inventory replacement costs, legal fees or other payments, including those resulting from our accuracy guarantee in our tax preparation products. For example, an error in our tax products could cause a compliance error for taxpayers, including the over or underpayment of their federal or state tax liability. While our accuracy guarantee commits us to reimburse penalties and interest paid by customers due solely to calculation errors in our tax preparation products, such errors may result in additional burdens on third parties that we may need to address or that may cause us to suspend the availability of our products until such errors are addressed. This could also affect our reputation, the willingness of customers to use our products, and our financial results. Further, as we develop our platform to connect people to experts, such as connecting TurboTax customers with tax experts through our TurboTax Live offering, or connecting QuickBooks customers with bookkeepers through our QuickBooks Live offering, we face the risk that these experts may provide advice that is erroneous, ineffective or otherwise unsuitable. Any such deficiency in the advice given by these experts may cause harm to our customers, a loss of customer confidence in our offerings or harm to our reputation or financial results. Moreover, as we continue to incorporate emerging technologies, like AI, into our offerings, they may not function as designed \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nor have unintended consequences, any of which could subject us to new or enhanced competitive harm, legal liability, regulatory scrutiny or reputational harm.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n•different or more restrictive privacy, data protection, data localization, and other laws that could require us to make changes to our products, services and operations, such as mandating that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country;\n•difficulties in developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n•stringent local labor laws and regulations;\n•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n•profit repatriation restrictions, and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n•geopolitical events and dynamics, including natural disasters or severe weather events (including those caused or exacerbated by climate change), acts of war and terrorism (including any conflicts in the Middle East) and any related military, political or economic responses, and public health emergencies, including divergent governmental responses thereto affecting the jurisdictions in which we operate or maintain a workforce or facilities;\n•compliance with sanctions and import or export regulations, including those arising from the Russia-Ukraine war;\n•compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and laws and regulations of other jurisdictions prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\n•antitrust and competition regulations;\n•potentially adverse tax developments;\n•economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt;\n•changes in trade policies and regulations, including the threat or imposition of protective trade measures, such as tariffs or other trade restrictions, as well as any retaliatory actions;\n•political or social unrest, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\n•risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws.\nViolations of the rapidly evolving and complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines, criminal actions or sanctions against us, our officers or our broader workforce, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Our policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws cannot ensure that our workforce, contractors and agents are in compliance with our policies. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nClimate change may have an impact on our business.\nOur environmental programs and efforts to partner with organizations that are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks may not be sufficient to mitigate the business risks associated with climate change. Additionally, we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Any of our primary workplace locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, our offices globally have historically experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, cold waves, extreme wind, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Furthermore, it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees to the extent they work away from our offices. Changing market dynamics, global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our third-party suppliers and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. We also expect to face increasing regulatory requirements and regulatory scrutiny related to climate matters, resulting in higher associated compliance costs.\n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nIncreasing and changing regulation of our businesses may adversely affect our ability to operate or harm our operating results.\nWe are subject to an increasing number of local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, and rules and standards. These relate to, without limitation, labor, advertising and marketing, tax, financial services, AI, data privacy and security, electronic funds transfer, money transmission, lending, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, intellectual property ownership and infringement, import and export requirements, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, insurance, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, antitrust and competition, environmental, health and safety, and other regulated activities. \nThe legal and regulatory environment in which we operate is complex, varies across jurisdictions and is subject to frequent change and evolving interpretations. New or amended laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, policies, and enforcement priorities may also be introduced. These dynamics affect our business. As we expand our offerings and evolve our business models, we have, and may in the future, become subject to additional regulatory requirements and heightened regulatory scrutiny. Our ability to adopt emerging technologies, including AI, and to innovate for our customers and operate our business may be harmed by the uncertainty and complexity created by the evolving legal and regulatory environment. For example, in February 2025, the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) went into force regulating AI systems that affect individuals located in the EU. Additionally, countries and states are applying their data and consumer protection laws to AI and/or enacting or considering legal frameworks on AI, including Utah, Colorado, and California. Compliance with these laws, and similar emerging laws, may add significant costs to our business and may require us to change certain business practices to comply. In addition, some of our offerings, such as our lending and payments products, require licenses to operate. Our inability to obtain or maintain a license, or to comply with current or new license requirements, may materially harm our ability to operate in specific jurisdictions or subject us to regulatory fines or penalties.\nThe tax preparation industry continues to receive heightened attention from federal and state governments. New legislation, regulation, public policy considerations, changes in the cybersecurity environment, litigation by the government or private entities, changes to or new interpretations of existing laws may result in greater oversight of the tax preparation industry, restrict the types of products and services that we can offer or the prices we can charge, or otherwise cause us to change the way we operate our tax businesses or offer our tax products and services. We are also required to comply with a variety of state revenue agency standards in order to successfully operate our tax preparation and electronic filing services. Changes in state-imposed requirements by one or more of the states, including the required use of specific technologies or technology standards, may significantly increase the costs of providing those services to our customers and may prevent us from delivering a quality product to our customers in a timely manner.\nAny perceived or actual failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and rules, including new interpretations of existing laws, regulations, and rules, could negatively impact our reputation, expose us to legal liability, fines, penalties, or require us to change our offerings or business operations. In addition, evolving laws, regulations, and rules may require us to modify our business practices or compliance programs in order to continue operating our businesses. Regulatory or legislative changes and other actions that materially affect our business may be announced with little or no advance notice, and we may be unable to respond quickly. As a result, we may face increased operating costs, reduced revenue opportunities, and may be unable to mitigate some or all of the adverse impacts those changes may cause. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our ability to operate and may harm our results of operations.\nComplex and evolving privacy and data protection regulations or changing customer expectations could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties or increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business. \nRegulations related to data privacy, cybersecurity, the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of data, and the use of AI are evolving. Many jurisdictions in which we operate globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, data privacy legislation or regulations aimed at creating and enhancing individual privacy rights. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates the collection, use, and retention of personal information by our offerings in the EU. In addition, in the absence of a unified federal privacy standard, a growing number of U.S. states have enacted or introduced data privacy laws and regulations. Several countries have established specific legal requirements for cross-border data transfers and governmental authorities and privacy advocates around the world continue to propose new regulatory actions concerning data protection. Moreover, several jurisdictions are considering regulatory frameworks for AI that implicate data protection laws. \nIn our efforts to meet the various data privacy regulations that apply to us, we have made and continue to make certain changes to our offerings, business practices, and use of certain third party tools and vendors. Additionally, customer sensitivity to privacy continues to increase and our privacy statements and practices may create additional customer expectations about the collection, use, and sharing of personal information. \nIn addition, the evolution of global privacy treaties and frameworks has created compliance uncertainty and increased complexity. For example, the judicial invalidation of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Safe Harbor frameworks that we relied on to transfer data created additional compliance challenges for the transfer of EU personal data to the U.S. While a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework currently provides a basis for us to transfer personal data from the European Union the U.S., the future of this framework is uncertain because it faces legal challenges in the European courts.\n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nEach of these privacy, security and data protection requirements could impose significant limitations on us, require changes to our business practices, require notification to customers, workers, and others of a security incident, restrict our use or storage of personal information, limit our use of third-party tools and vendors, or cause changes in customer purchasing behavior that may make our business more costly, less efficient or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future products or services, which may make customers less likely to purchase our products and may harm our future financial results. Additionally, any actual or alleged noncompliance with these laws and regulations, or failure to meet customer expectations could result in negative publicity or harm to our reputation and subject us to investigations, claims or other remedies, including demands that we modify or cease existing business practices, and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.\nWe are frequently a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings (including class action lawsuits), claims and regulatory inquiries that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional proceedings, claims and inquiries may arise in the future. The number and significance of these proceedings, claims and inquiries may increase as our businesses evolve. Any proceedings, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be time consuming; result in costly litigation, damage awards, consent decrees, injunctive relief or increased costs of business; require us to change our business practices or products; require significant amounts of management time; result in diversion of significant operations resources; or otherwise harm our business and future financial results. For further information about specific litigation, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”\nThird parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights may cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products.\nWe may become increasingly subject to infringement claims, including patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement claims. Litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others. We have received a number of allegations of intellectual property infringement claims in the past and expect to receive more claims in the future based on allegations that our offerings infringe upon the intellectual property held by third parties. Some of these claims are the subject of pending litigation against us and against some of our customers. These claims may involve patent holding companies or other adverse intellectual property owners who have no relevant product revenues of their own, and against whom our own intellectual property may provide little or no deterrence. The ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and, regardless of outcome, any such claim, with or without merit, may be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management’s time and attention from our business, require us to stop selling, delay shipping or redesign our products, or require us to pay monetary damages for royalty or licensing fees, or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers. Our failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims made against us may harm our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services.\nThe laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information such as online content disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges, and there has been an increasing demand for repealing or limiting the protections afforded by these laws through either judicial decision or legislation. In spite of settled law in the U.S., claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content. Where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the U.S., challenges may be brought under foreign laws which do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the U.S. These challenges in either U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require altering or limiting some of our services or may require additional contractual terms to avoid liabilities for our customers’ misconduct and may further give rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services. Certain of our services include content generated by users of our online services. Claims of intellectual property infringement, defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content, even if that content is not generated by us. Any claims, meritorious or not, may lead to business disruption and costs incurred as a result of this potential liability, which may harm our business.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nThe results of operations of our tax business may fluctuate from period to period due to the seasonality of the business and other factors beyond our control.\nOur tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns. Revenue from income tax preparation products and services has historically been heavily concentrated from November through April, as the tax filing deadline for the IRS and many states is traditionally in April. This seasonality has caused significant fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. In addition, unanticipated changes to federal and state tax filing deadlines may further exacerbate the impact of the seasonality.\nOur financial results from our tax offerings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of other factors, some of which may affect the timing of revenue recognition. These include the timing of the availability of federal and state tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive or process electronic tax return submissions or \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nissue refunds; changes to our offerings that result in the inclusion or exclusion of ongoing services; changes in product pricing strategies or product sales mix; changes in customer behavior; and the timing of our discontinuation of support for older product offerings. Other factors, including unanticipated changes to the tax code or the administration of government programs and payments by tax authorities, may cause variations from year to year in the number of tax filers. Any of the foregoing could negatively impact the number of tax returns we prepare and file and the operating results of our tax business. Other factors that may affect our quarterly or annual financial results include the timing of acquisitions, divestitures, and goodwill and acquired intangible asset impairment charges. Any fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.\nIf actual customer refunds for our offerings exceed the amount we have reserved, our future financial results may be harmed.\nLike many software companies, we refund customers for product returns and subscription and service cancellations. We establish reserves against revenue in our financial statements based on estimated customer refunds. We closely monitor this refund activity in an effort to maintain adequate reserves. In the past, customer refunds have not differed significantly from these reserves. However, if we experience actual customer refunds or an increase in risks of collecting customer payments that significantly exceed the amount we have reserved, it may result in lower net revenue.\nUnanticipated changes in our income tax rates or other indirect tax may affect our future financial results.\nOur future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, by changes in our stock price, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Foreign governments may enact tax laws, including in response to guidelines issued by international organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These continuous examinations may result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities, which may harm our future financial results.\nAn increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales, consumption, value added, or similar taxes. We may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly, or at all. Failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices, or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not, could result in material tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nAdverse global macroeconomic conditions could harm our business and financial condition.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, and perceptions or expectations about current or future conditions, such as volatility or distress in the financial markets, recession or inflationary pressures, slowing growth, rising interest rates, rising unemployment, rising consumer debt levels, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, government shutdowns and austerity programs could negatively affect our business and financial condition. These macroeconomic conditions or global events, such as political instability, sanctions, and war, have caused, and could, in the future, cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets, increased rates of default and bankruptcy, decreases in consumer and small business spending and other unforeseen consequences. It is difficult to predict the impact of such events on our partners, customers, members, or economic markets more broadly, which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments and businesses in response to macroeconomic events, and the effectiveness of those actions. Additionally, adverse developments that affect financial institutions, such as bank failures, or concerns or speculation about similar events or risks, could lead to liquidity challenges and further instability in the financial markets, which may in turn cause third parties, including customers, to become unable to meet their obligations under various types of financial arrangements. Moreover, because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales within the U.S., economic conditions in the U.S. have an even greater impact on us than companies with a more diverse international presence. Macroeconomic conditions, and perceptions or expectations about current or future conditions, could cause potential new customers not to purchase or to delay purchasing our offerings, and could cause our existing customers to discontinue purchasing or delay upgrades of our existing offerings. Some financial institutions and other partners have in the past decreased or suspended their activity on Credit Karma’s platform and could do so in the future. In addition, increased interest rates may make offers from Credit Karma’s partners less attractive to Credit Karma's members. Members may decrease their engagement on the platform or their creditworthiness could be negatively impacted, reducing members' ability to qualify for credit cards and loans. Decreased consumer spending levels could also reduce payment processing volumes, causing reductions in our payments revenue. High unemployment and changes in the tax code and the government programs that are administered by tax authorities have caused, and could in the future cause, a significant decrease in the number of tax returns filed, which may have a significant effect on the number of tax returns we prepare and file. In addition, weakness in our end-user markets could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which could increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue or future sales to these customers. Adverse economic conditions may also increase the costs of operating our business, including vendor, supplier and workforce expenses. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets or increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity positions. Such conditions may also \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nexpose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and negatively impact our future financial results.\nWe provide access to capital to small and mid-market businesses, which exposes us to risk, and may cause us material financial or reputational harm.\nWe provide qualified small and mid-market businesses with access to capital from third-party lenders and then we purchase some or all of those loans from the lender. This activity exposes us to the risk of the borrowers’ inability to repay such loans. We have entered into credit arrangements with financial institutions as a source of funding to purchase some or all of the loans. Any termination or interruption in the financial institutions’ ability to lend to us could interrupt our ability to provide capital to these businesses. Further, the credit decisioning, pricing, loss forecasting, scoring and other models used to evaluate loan applications may contain errors or may not adequately assess creditworthiness of the borrowers, or may be otherwise ineffective, resulting in incorrect approvals or denials of loans. It is also possible that loan applicants could provide false or incorrect information. Moreover, adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation and rising interest rates, have impacted and may continue to impact these businesses, which are disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns, and may increase the likelihood that the borrowers are unable to repay their loans. If any of the foregoing events were to occur, our reputation, relationships with borrowers, collections of loans receivable and financial results could be harmed.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment charges may cause significant fluctuation in our net income.\nOur acquisitions have resulted in significant expenses, including amortization and impairment of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets, and impairment of goodwill. We may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill already recorded and to goodwill arising out of future acquisitions. We test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. The timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that may not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods. New acquisitions, and any impairment of the value of acquired intangible assets, may have a significant negative impact on our future financial results. \nWe have incurred indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nWe have indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional short-term and long-term debt in the future. This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:\n•increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions; and\n•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and our industries.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required, among other things, to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets or reduce or delay planned capital, operating or investment expenditures. Such measures may not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt.\nAdditionally, the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictions on us and require us to comply with certain covenants. For example, our credit facilities restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes limit our ability to create liens on our and subsidiaries’ assets and engage in sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of these covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or the noteholders, as applicable, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any or all of our outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.\nUnder the terms of our 2020 Notes, we may be required to repurchase the notes for cash prior to their maturity in connection with the occurrence of certain changes of control that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the notes. The repayment obligations under the notes may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company. If we were required to pay the notes prior to their scheduled maturity, it could have a negative impact on our cash position and liquidity and impair our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives.\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our unsecured revolving credit facility may increase. In addition, adverse economic conditions or any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may negatively impact the terms of any such financing. There can be no assurance that any refinancing or additional financing would be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, if at all. For further information about our indebtedness, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents\n\nWe cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nWe have a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase our common stock. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Even if our stock repurchase program is fully implemented, it may not enhance long-term stockholder value. Also, the amount, timing, and execution of our stock repurchase programs may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes and because of changes in cash flows, tax laws, and the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value.\nOur stock price is subject to changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or legal proceedings can cause changes in our stock price. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions, including the effects of a general slowdown in the global economy, inflationary pressures, pandemics and endemics, significant armed conflicts, acts of war and terrorism, and the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us, and any announcements by us of acquisitions, major transactions, or management changes may cause volatility in our stock price. Moreover, inflationary pressures, pandemics and endemics, and significant armed conflicts, acts of war and terrorism have caused, and in the future may cause, increased volatility in the global financial markets and, in turn, our stock price. Further, any changes in the amounts or frequency of share repurchases or dividends may also adversely affect our stock price. A significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which may result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business.\n\nIntuit Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K     \nTable of Contents",
