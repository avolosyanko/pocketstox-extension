constantly evolving. Management believes that Truist’s purpose, mission, and values, including a caring client-first approach, are a competitive advantage that strengthens the Company’s ability to provide financial products and services to businesses and individuals in its markets. The Company has recently made significant investments to develop its digital platform, including enhancements to its mobile and online applications to meet its clients’ digital expectations. Legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes, as well as continued consolidation within the industry, have resulted in increased competition from new and existing market participants, which is expected to continue in the future. Truist competes actively with national, regional, and local financial services providers, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment advisers, asset managers, securities brokers and dealers, private-equity funds, hedge funds, mortgage-banking companies, finance companies, and financial technology companies. At the same time, non-banking entities, including financial technology companies, have increased competition by providing financial products and services directly to customers and indirectly through partnerships.\nMany of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which we operate. Some also have greater scale, financial and operational resources, investment capacity, product and service offerings, and brand recognition. Our competitors may be subject to different and, in some cases, less stringent legislative, regulatory, and supervisory regimes than Truist. Certain competitors differ from us in their strategic and tactical priorities and, for example, may be willing to suffer meaningful financial losses in the pursuit of disruptive innovation and client growth or to accept more aggressive business, compliance, and other risks in the pursuit of higher returns and market valuations. Competition affects every aspect of our business, including product and service offerings, rates, pricing and fees, credit limits, and client service. Successfully competing in our markets also depends on our ability to innovate, to invest in technology and infrastructure, to execute transactions reliably and efficiently, to maintain and enhance our reputation, and to attract, retain, and motivate talented teammates, all while effectively managing risks and expenses. We expect that competition will only intensify in the future.\nPurpose, Mission, and Values\nOur purpose is to inspire and build better lives and communities.\nOur mission is to:\n•Provide clients with distinctive, secure, and successful experiences through touch and technology;\n•Create an inclusive and energizing environment that empowers teammates to learn, grow, and have meaningful careers; and\n•Optimize long-term value for stakeholders through safe, sound, and ethical practices.\nOur values are: \n•Trustworthy – we serve with integrity\n•Caring – everyone and every moment matters\n•One Team – together we can accomplish anything\n•Success – when our clients win, we all win\n•Happiness – positive energy changes lives\nStrategy\nOur strategic direction is to build the top super regional bank that grows with our clients with care. Our 2025 strategic objectives are to:\n•Leverage our capital position by growing and capturing additional share within our high growth markets and existing client base in key focus areas in WB and CSBB and in areas, markets, and client solutions where we have invested significantly and have momentum.\n•In WB, deepen and grow existing client relationships in areas like Payments and Wealth, enhance the client digital experience, continue our momentum in Investment Banking and Trading, and capture more share of the commercial middle market.\n•In CSBB, grow core deposits, deepen existing relationships with Premier clients, enhance the client digital experience, and drive additional fee and loan growth through our differentiated consumer lending solutions.\n•Continue to invest in important areas like new and existing talent, technology, risk, and cybersecurity, while maintaining our expense discipline with a goal of driving positive operating leverage.\n•Maintain our credit and risk discipline.\n•Return capital to shareholders through our common stock dividend and share repurchase authorization.\nTruist Financial Corporation 5\n\n\nAlthough mergers and acquisitions are not a top capital deployment priority for Truist, the Company will assess opportunities when strategic and business objectives, profitability, cultural fit, market and regulatory conditions, capital and liquidity, and risk-management considerations favorably align.\nChallenges and unforeseen events could have an adverse impact on Truist’s financial condition, results of operations, and strategy. See the sections titled “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for examples of such challenges and events.\nRegulatory and Supervisory Considerations\nWe are subject to significant regulatory frameworks that affect the products and services that we may offer and the manner in which we may offer them, the risks that we may take, the ways in which we may operate, and the corporate and financial actions that we may take.\nVarious governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations oversee our business activities and therefore supervise and periodically examine us. These agencies and organizations generally have broad authority and discretion in restricting and otherwise affecting our businesses and operations and may take formal or informal supervisory, enforcement, and other actions against us when, in the applicable agency’s or organization’s judgment, our businesses or operations fail to comply with applicable law, comport with safe and sound practices, or meet supervisory expectations.\nThe regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other customers, the DIF, the broader economy, and the stability of the U.S. financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and non-deposit creditors. In addition to banking statutes, regulations, and other laws, Truist is subject to various other laws that directly or indirectly affect its business and operations, including its ability to make distributions to shareholders. Governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations also issue policy statements, interpretive letters, guidance, and other documents and communications that similarly impact Truist. The scope, complexity, intensity, and interpretation of these laws, documents, communications, and actions can vary based on such factors as the state of the economy, the prevailing political environment, and the performance of businesses and operations by us and other financial institutions.\nThe scope of the laws, documents, communications, and actions, including the intensity of the supervision to which the banking industry is subject, have increased in recent years. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Truist expects to remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\nThis section summarizes some relevant provisions of the principal statutes, regulations, and other laws that apply to us. These descriptions, however, are qualified in their entirety by the full text and judicial or administrative interpretations of those laws. This summary also does not cover all possible or proposed changes in laws applicable to us.\nGeneral\nAs a BHC, Truist is subject to the BHCA and to regulation, supervision, and examination by the FRB. Truist Bank, a North Carolina state-chartered commercial bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the NCCOB and the FDIC. Truist Bank and its affiliates are also subject to examination by the CFPB for compliance with most federal consumer financial protection laws.\nTruist and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including those that engage in derivatives transactions, securities underwriting, market making, brokerage, and investment advisory activities, are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations, as well as supervision and examination by other federal and state regulatory agencies and other regulatory authorities, including the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, and NFA. Truist Bank is subject to additional state and federal laws, as well as various regulations, which govern its activities, the investments it may make, and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower.\nExaminations by regulators consider not only compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and supervisory policies of the agency, but also capital levels, asset quality, risk management effectiveness, the ability and performance of management and the Board, the effectiveness of internal controls, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. Following examinations by banking supervisors, Truist and Truist Bank may receive supervisory findings and ultimately are assigned supervisory ratings. Examination reports, supervisory ratings, and other actions under this supervisory framework, which are considered confidential supervisory information, can impact the conduct, growth, and profitability of Truist’s operations, possibly to a significant degree. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for more information on legal, regulatory, and compliance risks.\n6 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nUnder the FRB’s Large Financial Institution Rating System, component ratings are assigned for capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management, and governance and controls. To be considered “well managed” under this rating system, a firm must be rated “broadly meets expectations” or “conditionally meets expectations” for each of its three component ratings.\nDepending on the results of examinations of Truist, federal or state bank regulators can impose significant limitations on our activities and growth. These regulatory agencies generally have broad enforcement authority and discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity. Examples of restrictions and limitations include the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements where the relevant agency determines that the operations of the regulated entity or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner, engage in an unfair, deceptive, abusive act or practice, or do not meet supervisory expectations. The intensity of supervision has increased in recent years.\nFHC Regulation\nTruist has elected to be treated as a FHC, which allows it to engage in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permissible for a BHC, including activities that are financial in nature or incidental thereto, such as securities underwriting or merchant banking. Although FHCs may engage in certain acquisitions of nonbank companies without prior approval of the FRB, any acquisition of a nonbank company or voting shares of a nonbank company with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more would require prior approval of the FRB. To maintain its standing as a FHC, Truist and its affiliated IDI must be well-capitalized and well managed and Truist Bank must have at least a satisfactory CRA rating. If the FRB determines that a FHC is not well-capitalized or well managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the FHC. In such a situation, the FRB may also place limitations on the ability of an FHC to conduct certain business activities that FHCs are generally permitted to conduct, as well as the FHC’s ability to make certain acquisitions. If the failure to meet these standards persists, a FHC may be required to divest its IDI subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by BHCs that are not FHCs. Furthermore, if an IDI subsidiary of a FHC has not maintained a satisfactory CRA rating, the FHC would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities, although the FHC would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities. Federal regulations require a FHC to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. In times of severe financial stress, the obligation to serve as a source of strength could cause Truist to commit significant resources to supporting Truist Bank that otherwise would be available to Truist’s creditors and shareholders.\nResolution Planning\nAs a Category III banking organization, Truist is required to submit to the FRB and FDIC a resolution plan every three years with submissions alternating between a full resolution plan and a targeted resolution plan (a “165(d) Resolution Plan”). Upon review of the plan, the agencies may jointly determine that a resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon making this determination, the agencies would provide a joint notice identifying one or more deficiencies that could undermine the feasibility of the resolution plan. If Truist receives such a notice and fails to submit a timely revised resolution plan or a revised resolution plan that fails to adequately address the deficiencies, the agencies could subject Truist to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on growth, activities, or operations. Truist submitted its inaugural resolution plan to the FRB and FDIC in September 2021. On September 30, 2022, the FRB and FDIC announced that they did not identify any shortcomings or deficiencies in Truist’s resolution plan. Truist’s next full 165(d) Resolution Plan is due October 1, 2025.\nIn addition, Truist Bank, as an IDI, is required by FDIC regulation to file a separate bank level resolution plan every three years (an “IDI Resolution Plan”). Truist Bank submitted its inaugural IDI Resolution Plan to the FDIC in November 2022. In 2024, the FDIC adopted a final rule that significantly modified the required frequency and informational content of IDI Resolution Plans. As a result of the rule, Truist Bank must submit a full IDI Resolution Plan to the FDIC every three years and an interim supplement in the years in which a full IDI Resolution Plan is not due. Further, the final rule introduces a new credibility standard for evaluating the adequacy of IDI Resolution Plan submissions, including increased engagement and capabilities testing. The application of this new credibility standard may require the exercise of a meaningful degree of judgment by the FDIC. A failure by Truist Bank to satisfy the credibility standard, or any other provision of the rule, may cause the FDIC to require Truist Bank to reconsider portions of its IDI Resolution Plan or result in an enforcement action by the FDIC. Truist Bank’s first interim supplement is due July 1, 2025, and its full IDI Resolution Plan submission is due July 1, 2026.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards and Regulatory Tailoring Rules\nU.S. BHCs, including Truist, are subject to a range of prudential standards based on their size and complexity. Truist is subject to more stringent liquidity and capital requirements, leverage limits, stress testing, single-counterparty credit limits, resolution planning, and enhanced risk management standards than those applicable to smaller institutions, while certain larger banking organizations are subject to even more enhanced prudential standards than Truist.\nTruist Financial Corporation 7\n\n\nUnder the Tailoring Rules, Truist is subject to the standards applicable to Category III banking organizations, which generally include BHCs with greater than $250 billion, but less than $700 billion, in total consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in certain risk-related exposures.\nCapital Requirements\nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to certain risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements. These are established by the FRB, for Truist, and by the FDIC, for Truist Bank. These requirements are based on the capital framework developed by the BCBS for strengthening the regulation, supervision, and risk management of banks under Basel III rules, as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These quantitative calculations prescribe minimum capital levels, and the FRB and FDIC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital to operate in a safe and sound manner. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition. These actions could include requiring Truist to commit capital to Truist Bank in abnormal operating conditions which would otherwise be available to Truist’s creditors and shareholders. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on Truist’s or Truist Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval for acquisitions.\nUnder the regulatory capital rules, Truist’s and Truist Bank’s assets, exposures, and certain off-balance sheet items are subject to risk weights under the standardized approach used to determine the institutions’ risk-weighted assets. These risk-weighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for Truist and Truist Bank:\n•CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital primarily includes common shareholders’ equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions, including with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, and AOCI.\n•Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock, and certain qualifying capital instruments.\n•Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, equal to the ratio of total capital, including CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying ALLL. Tier 2 capital also includes, among other things, certain trust preferred securities.\nUnder the FRB’s capital framework for BHCs, Truist is subject to capital requirements, including the SCB, that are determined from the supervisory stress test results. The SCB is equal to the greater of (i) the difference between Truist’s starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test, plus the sum of the dollar amount of its planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of risk-weighted assets, or (ii) 2.5%. The FRB assigned Truist an SCB of 2.8%, which is effective from October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025, at which point a revised SCB will be calculated and provided to Truist. Truist is required to describe its planned capital actions in its CCAR capital plan, but is no longer required to seek prior approval if it makes capital distributions in excess of those included in its CCAR capital plan. Instead, Truist is subject to automatic distribution limitations if its capital ratios fall below its buffer requirements, which include the SCB.\nFor certain large banking organizations, the SCB could be supplemented by a countercyclical capital buffer of up to an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. This buffer is currently set at zero. An FRB policy statement establishes the framework and factors the FRB would use in setting and adjusting the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer. Covered banking organizations would generally have 12 months after the announcement of any increase in the countercyclical capital buffer to meet the increased buffer requirement, unless the FRB determines to establish an earlier effective date. If the full countercyclical buffer amount is implemented, Truist would be required to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 9.8%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 11.3%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 13.3% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary incentive compensation payments. In addition, Truist Bank would be required to maintain a CET1 capital ratio of at least 9.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 11.0%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 13.0%.\nCertain large banking organizations with trading assets and liabilities above certain thresholds, including Truist, are subject to the Market Risk Rule and must adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk of their trading activities. Refer to the “Market Risk” section of the MD&A for additional disclosures related to market risk management.\nTruist and Truist Bank are subject to a Tier 1 leverage ratio, equal to the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets, net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain other deductions. Category III banking organizations are also subject to a minimum 3.0% supplementary leverage ratio. The supplementary leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by total leverage exposure, which takes into account on-balance sheet assets as well as certain off-balance sheet items, including loan commitments and potential future exposure of derivative contracts.\n8 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nThe FRB has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for BHCs to reflect capital requirements imposed under the Basel III Rules. For purposes of certain FRB rules, including determining whether a BHC meets the requirements to be a FHC, BHCs, such as Truist, must maintain a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.0% or greater and a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater to meet the well-capitalized minimum. The FRB may require BHCs, including Truist, to maintain capital ratios in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a BHC’s particular condition, risk profile, and growth plans.\nIn July 2023, the U.S. banking regulators issued a proposal to revise the risk-based capital standards applicable to Truist and Truist Bank. This proposal would introduce new approaches for credit risk, operational risk, market risk, and credit valuation adjustment risk that generally align with the approaches for these risks under the global Basel Accord adopted by the Basel Committee. The proposal would introduce a new measure of risk-weighted assets, which would reflect the proposed new standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk, and credit valuation adjustment risk, as well as a proposed new measure for market risk that would be based on both internal models and standardized supervisory models of market risk. In addition, the proposal requires Category III and IV financial institutions to include certain components of AOCI in the calculation of regulatory capital, as well as change the calculation of certain deductions consistent with standards in place for Category I and II financial institutions. The FRB has indicated the intent to re-propose the revised risk-based capital standards. The potential impacts on Truist and Truist Bank of a final rule remains uncertain.\nRefer to the “Capital” section in MD&A for disclosures containing the minimum regulatory capital ratios and well-capitalized minimum ratios applicable to Category III banking organizations.\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Requirements\nIn addition to the regulatory capital requirements, under the FRB’s CCAR process and related capital plan rule, Truist must submit an annual capital plan to the FRB that reflects its projected financial performance under hypothetical macro-economic scenarios, including stress scenarios designed by Truist and a supervisory severely adverse scenario provided by the FRB.\nThe FRB’s CCAR framework and the Dodd-Frank Act stress testing framework also require BHCs subject to Category III standards, such as Truist, to conduct company-run stress tests and submit to supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB. The company-run stress tests employ stress scenarios provided by the FRB and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act capital actions, which are intended to normalize capital distribution assumptions across large U.S. BHCs. In addition, Truist is required to conduct annual stress tests using internally-developed scenarios intended to stress the unique risk profile of the institution. The FRB also conducts CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests employing internal supervisory models on the supervisory stress scenarios. As a Category III banking organization, Truist is subject to supervisory stress testing on an annual basis and company-run stress testing on a biennial basis.\nTruist is required to submit its next capital plan and the results of its own stress tests to the FRB by April 5, 2025. The FRB is required to announce the results of its supervisory stress tests by June 30, 2025.\nIn addition to the CCAR stress testing for Truist, Truist Bank conducts company-run stress tests on an annual basis, though those tests are only required biennially. Truist and Truist Bank also conduct periodic company-run stress tests that are not related to supervisory stress testing requirements.\nLiquidity Requirements\nCertain BHCs and their bank subsidiaries, including Truist and Truist Bank, are subject to a minimum LCR and NSFR. The LCR rule requires that banking organizations maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient within the parameters of the rule to meet estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of stress. The NSFR rule defines a minimum amount of stable, long-term funding that banking organizations must maintain in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. The NSFR, calculated as the ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding, must exceed 1.0x. Available stable funding represents a weighted measure of a company’s funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated by applying standardized weightings to the company’s equity and liabilities based on their expected stability. Required Stable Funding is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets, derivatives exposures, and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics. As a Category III banking organization, Truist and Truist Bank are subject to LCR and NSFR requirements equal to 85% of the full requirement.\nTruist also is subject to FRB rules that require certain large BHCs to conduct internal liquidity stress tests over a range of time horizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net outflows under the BHC’s 30-day liquidity stress test, and maintain a contingency funding plan that meets certain requirements.\nTruist Financial Corporation 9\n\n\nLong-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements\nIn 2023, the U.S. banking regulators proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total assets to comply with long-term debt requirements and clean holding company requirements that currently apply only to GSIBs. This proposal would also impose a long-term debt requirement on certain categories of insured depository institutions, including insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total assets, such as Truist Bank. If adopted, this proposal would require Truist and Truist Bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible long-term debt amount equal to the largest of (i) 6% of risk-weighted assets, (ii) 2.5% of total leverage exposure, and (iii) 3.5% of average total consolidated assets. Truist Bank would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible long-term debt to Truist, and Truist would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible long-term debt externally. In addition, if adopted as proposed, the clean holding company requirement would limit or prohibit Truist from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution, including, for example, prohibiting Truist from entering into transactions that could spread losses to subsidiaries and third parties, as well as limiting the amount of Truist’s liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt. The timing and form of any final rule implementing the long-term debt requirements and clean holding company requirements remains uncertain.\nPayment of Dividends\nThe Parent Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries, and it depends in part upon dividends received from its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including Truist Bank, to fund its activities, including its ability to make capital distributions, such as paying dividends or repurchasing shares. Under federal law, there are various limitations on the extent to which Truist Bank can declare and pay dividends to the Parent Company, including those related to regulatory capital requirements, general regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices, and federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits, surplus, and available earnings. Certain contractual restrictions also may limit the ability of Truist Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Company. No assurances can be given that Truist Bank will, in any circumstances, pay dividends to the Parent Company.\nThe Parent Company’s ability to declare and pay dividends is similarly limited by federal banking law and FRB regulations and policy. The FRB has authority to prohibit BHCs from making capital distributions if they would be deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for BHCs to pay dividends unless a BHC’s net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In addition, the Parent Company’s ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends and repurchasing shares, is subject to the FRB’s automatic restrictions on capital distributions under the FRB’s capital rules. Truist’s risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements are discussed above in the “Capital Requirements” section.\nNorth Carolina law provides that, as long as a bank does not make distributions that reduce its capital below its applicable required capital, the board of directors of a bank chartered under the laws of North Carolina may declare such distributions as the directors deem proper.\nPrompt Corrective Action\nThe federal banking agencies are required to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The law establishes five categories for this purpose: “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” To be considered “well-capitalized,” an IDI must maintain minimum capital ratios and must not be subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution that fails to remain well-capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens. Such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions, restrictions on asset growth, or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications. The regulations apply only to banks and not to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level, based on the undercapitalized status of the holding company’s subsidiary banking institutions. In certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution, the BHC, in its capacity as a source of strength would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments.\nIn addition, failure to meet capital requirements may cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital. Federal law further mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards generally relating to operations and management, asset quality, and executive compensation; and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards. Failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies, including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities, termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and, under certain conditions, the appointment of a conservator or receiver.\n10 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nTransactions with Affiliates\nThere are various legal restrictions on the extent to which Truist and its nonbank subsidiaries may borrow or otherwise engage in certain types of transactions with Truist Bank. Under the Federal Reserve Act and FRB regulations, Truist Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit, purchases of assets, and certain other transactions involving its nonbank affiliates. In addition, transactions between Truist Bank and its nonbank affiliates are required to be on arm’s length terms and must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness.\nAcquisitions\nTruist is subject to numerous laws that may require regulatory approval for acquisitions. For example, under the BHCA, a BHC may not directly or indirectly acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any BHC or bank or merge or consolidate with another BHC without the prior approval of the FRB. The BHCA and other federal laws enumerate the factors the FRB must consider when reviewing the merger of BHCs, the acquisition of banks or the acquisition of voting securities of a bank or BHC. These factors include the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets; the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction; the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the U.S.; the organizations’ compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served; and the records of performance under the CRA of the IDIs involved in the transaction.\nFederal law authorizes interstate acquisitions of banks and BHCs without geographic limitation, and a bank headquartered in one state is authorized to merge with a bank headquartered in another state, subject to market share limitations, regulatory approvals, and any state requirement that the target bank shall have been in existence and operating for a minimum period of time. The market share limitations impose conditions that the acquiring BHC, after and as a result of the acquisition, control no more than 10% of the total amount of deposits of IDIs in the U.S. and no more than 30%, subject to variation by state law, of such deposits in applicable states. FRB rules also prohibit a FHC from combining with another company if the resulting company’s liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies.\nAfter a bank has established branches in a state through an interstate merger transaction, the bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state where a bank headquartered in that state could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law. These regulatory considerations are applicable to privately negotiated acquisition transactions.\nThe standards by which bank and financial institution acquisitions are evaluated have been undergoing review and change by the federal agencies. As a result, it is uncertain how these new policies will be applied.\nIn July 2024, the FDIC released a proposed rule to amend its regulations under the Change in Bank Control Act, which generally provides that no person may directly or indirectly acquire control of an insured depository institution unless the person has given the appropriate federal banking agency prior notice of the proposed transaction and the agency has not disapproved it. The FDIC’s regulations contain a rebuttable presumption that the acquisition of voting securities of a holding company like Truist that directly or indirectly controls an insured state nonmember bank like Truist Bank constitutes such an acquisition of control requiring prior notice to the FDIC if, immediately after the transaction, the acquiring person will own, control, or hold with power to vote 10% or more of any class of voting securities of the holding company and other specified conditions are met. The proposed rule removes an explicit exemption for transactions where the FRB reviews a notice under the Change in Bank Control Act. We continue to evaluate this proposal and its potential impacts, if adopted as proposed, on Truist and Truist Bank.\nIn September 2024, the FDIC adopted a final statement of policy regarding its review of Bank Merger Act applications. The final policy statement addresses, among other things, the scope of transactions subject to FDIC approval, a more rigorous FDIC process for evaluating Bank Merger Act applications, and the FDIC Board’s heightened expectations with respect to the Bank Merger Act’s statutory factors. As a result, Bank Merger Act applications to the FDIC will now require additional information and transactions that would result in a bank with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets will be subject to heightened scrutiny. It is unclear whether and how the FDIC will implement its final statement of policy on bank mergers.\nIn addition, the U.S. DOJ clarified that it will assess competition considerations in connection with bank and bank holding company mergers using its 2023 Merger Guidelines, which is the general merger review framework the U.S. DOJ now uses to evaluate transactions in all segments of the economy, and a newly-issued 2024 Banking Addendum (“2024 Banking Addendum”). Previously the U.S. DOJ assessed bank and bank holding company mergers under the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, which focused primarily on concentrations of deposits and branches. Since the 2024 Banking Addendum allows for consideration of theories of harm and relevant markets not considered in the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines, it remains uncertain how the U.S. DOJ will ultimately apply this new merger review framework to bank mergers.\nTruist Financial Corporation 11\n\n\nOther Safety and Soundness Regulations\nThe FRB has supervisory and enforcement powers over BHCs and their non-banking subsidiaries. The FRB has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound practices or constitute violations of law, rule, regulation, administrative order, or written agreement with a federal regulator. These powers may be exercised through the issuance of confidential supervisory actions, cease and desist orders, civil monetary penalties, or other actions.\nThere also are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on BHCs and their IDI subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to depositors and the DIF in the event the IDI is insolvent or is in danger of becoming insolvent. For example, the FRB requires a BHC to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary IDIs and to commit financial resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so otherwise.\nBanking regulators also have broad supervisory and enforcement powers over Truist Bank, including the power to impose confidential supervisory actions, fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver in order to conserve the assets of Truist Bank for the benefit of depositors and other creditors. The NCCOB also has the authority to take possession of a North Carolina state bank in certain circumstances, including when it appears that such bank has violated its charter or any applicable laws, is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to transact its business or has an impairment of its capital stock.\nDIF Assessments\nTruist Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits, which is currently $250,000 per account ownership type. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for an IDI based on an assessment rate calculator, which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each IDI poses to the DIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as defined under the Dodd-Frank Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly.\nThe FDIC implemented a special assessment to recoup losses to the DIF associated with bank failures in 2023. The assessment is based on an insured depository institution’s estimated uninsured deposits reported as of December 31, 2022. The special assessment for Truist Bank was $64 million and $507 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Truist Bank may be subject to additional adjustments due to change in the estimated relevant losses to the DIF reported by the FDIC. In June 2024, the FDIC provided notification that the collection period will be extended an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight quarterly installments. The special assessment will be paid in ten quarterly installments, which began in the second quarter of 2024. The ultimate amount of expenses associated with the special assessment will also be impacted by the finalization of the losses incurred by the FDIC in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, which could result in additional expense.\nConsumer Protection Laws and Regulations\nIn connection with its lending and leasing activities, Truist Bank is subject to federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. The CFPB examines Truist and Truist Bank for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to deposit products, credit card, mortgage, automobile, student, and other consumer loans, and other consumer financial products and services offered. The federal consumer financial protection laws that are subject to the CFPB’s supervision and enforcement powers include, among others, the Truth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Electronic Funds Transfer Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The CFPB also has authority to take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive, or abusive, and to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service.\n12 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nIn October 2024, the CFPB finalized a rule under the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires certain entities, including Truist and Truist Bank, to, among other things, make available to a consumer, upon request, information in its control or possession concerning the consumer financial product or service that the consumer obtained from that entity. The rule also requires data providers holding a consumer account, such as Truist Bank, to establish a developer interface satisfying certain data security specifications and other standards, through which the data provider can receive requests for, and provide, specific types of data covered by the rule in electronic, usable form to authorized third parties, including data aggregators. Data providers are prohibited from charging consumers or third parties fees for processing these consumer data requests. The rule also places certain data security, authorization, and other obligations on third parties accessing covered data from data providers, which could include Truist and Truist Bank when acting in certain capacities. The rule also requires such third parties to limit their collection, use, and retention of the data received from the applicable data provider to only what is reasonably necessary to provide the applicable consumer’s requested product or service, including uses that are reasonably necessary to improve the product or service. The compliance date for a data provider that is a depository institution with over $250 billion in total assets is April 1, 2026; however, the final rule is subject to ongoing litigation that could impact whether and when Truist and Truist Bank are required to comply with the rule. We continue to evaluate the final rule and the potential impacts on Truist and Truist Bank.\nThe CFPB may issue additional regulations that impact products and services offered by Truist or Truist Bank. The regulations could reduce the fees that Truist and Truist Bank receives, alter the way products and services are provided, or increase the risk of private litigation or regulatory enforcement action.\nBSA and Patriot Act\nFinancial institutions, including Truist Bank, are subject to the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism requirements of the BSA and its implementing regulations. The BSA was amended by the Patriot Act to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to cooperate in the prevention, detection, and prosecution of international money laundering and the financing of terrorism and was further amended by the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020. The BSA, as amended, contains anti-money laundering measures affecting IDIs, broker-dealers and certain other financial institutions. The BSA requires those financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism and grants the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury broad authority to issue regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions’ operations. The BSA further imposes substantial obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures, and processes to detect, prevent, and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, or restrictions on business. In addition, the Patriot Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and BHC acquisitions.\nBSA/AML and Sanctions\nFinancial institutions that are subject to the BSA are subject to examinations and ongoing monitoring to assess compliance with BSA/AML and OFAC laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the financial system, consumers, and financial institutions from bad actors and illicit activities by requiring financial institutions to develop and implement BSA/AML programs designed to deter and when possible detect and prevent the use of the financial system to facilitate the funding of criminal activities. In addition, financial institutions are also required to comply with sanctions programs administered by OFAC and the U.S. Department of State, which prohibit financial transactions involving certain individuals, entities, countries, and territories and impose other restrictions on certain investments and dealings.\nFederal law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal financial institution regulators, OFAC, and the U.S. DOJ, among other government agencies, with respect to AML and OFAC laws and regulations. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines, or restitution; to issue cease and desist or prohibition orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against financial institutions and institution-affiliated parties. These enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations, or for unsafe and unsound practices.\nPrivacy, Data Protection, and Cybersecurity\nVarious federal and state laws and regulations contain extensive data privacy, data protection and cybersecurity provisions, and the regulatory framework for data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity is rapidly evolving. The FRB, FDIC, and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential, personal customer information. These guidelines require each financial institution, under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, to create, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to support the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. In addition, various U.S. regulators, including the FRB and the SEC, have increased their focus on cybersecurity through guidance, examinations, and regulations.\nTruist Financial Corporation 13\n\n\nAt the federal level, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions to, among other things, implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. In general, the statute requires that financial institutions provide explanations to consumers on their policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required by law, prohibits disclosing such personal information except as provided in the financial institution’s policies and procedures.\nA joint regulation from the FRB, OCC, and FDIC requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulators as soon as possible and within 36 hours after identifying a “computer-security incident” that the banking organization believes in good faith has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade its business or operations in a manner that would, among other things, jeopardize the viability of its operations, result in customers being unable to access their deposit and other accounts, result in a material loss of revenue, profit or stock price, or pose a threat to the financial stability of the U.S.\nIn addition, once implementing regulations are finalized, the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (“CIRCIA”) will require, among other things, covered entities to report significant cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks, to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (“CISA”) within 72 hours from the time the covered entity reasonably believes the incident occurred (and within 24 hours of making a ransom payment as a result of a ransomware attack). The CISA proposed a rule under the CIRCIA in April 2024 that would clarify the scope of cyber incidents to be reported and would further define covered entities subject to the CIRCIA to include banking organizations like Truist.\nTruist’s nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to rules and regulations issued by the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including with respect to data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. Moreover, the U.S. Congress has recently considered, and is expected to continue to consider various proposals for, more comprehensive data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity legislation.\nLike other lenders, Truist Bank uses credit bureau data in its underwriting activities. The Fair Credit Reporting Act regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates, and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on Truist Bank.\nStates are also increasingly proposing or enacting legislation that relates to data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity such as the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act. Truist may be subject to similar laws in other states where Truist does business or in states where Truist may collect personal information of residents. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states generally require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to individuals whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach.\nMoreover, the New York Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Regulation is driving significant cybersecurity compliance activities for Truist. This regulation includes phased compliance periods as well as attestation of compliance by certain Truist entities.\nTruist has undertaken significant efforts to comply with these laws and regulations and continues to assess their requirements and applicability to Truist. These laws and regulations, as well as proposed legislation and regulation, are subject to revision or formal guidance and may be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with the Company’s understanding, which may result in further uncertainty and require Truist to incur additional costs to comply. Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for more information on the risks related to compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations.\nCRA\nThe CRA requires the FDIC to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve,” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” This assessment is considered for any bank that applies to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an IDI, or to open or relocate a branch office. The CRA record of each subsidiary bank of a FHC also is assessed by the FRB in connection with the review of any proposed acquisition or merger application. For its most recent CRA examination period, Truist Bank received the highest possible overall rating of “Outstanding” from the FDIC.\n14 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nIn October 2023, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC issued a final rule to amend their regulations implementing the CRA. The rule materially revises the current CRA framework, including the assessment areas in which a bank is evaluated to include activities associated with online and mobile banking, the tests used to evaluate the bank in its assessment areas, new methods of calculating credit for lending, investment, and service activities, and additional data collection and reporting requirements. The rule was expected to result in a significant increase in the thresholds for large banks to receive “Outstanding” ratings in the future. The rule was expected to take effect on April 1, 2024, with most of the provisions becoming applicable on January 1, 2026. Reporting of the collected data will not be required until 2027. Several banking industry groups filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the CRA final rule, in which they argued that the federal banking agencies exceeded their statutory authority. In March 2024, a federal judge granted an injunction to extend the CRA final rule’s effective date. The effective date will be extended each day the injunction remains in place, pending the resolution of the lawsuit. It is unknown whether and when the CRA final rule will become effective.\nAutomated Overdraft Payment Regulation\nThere are federal consumer protection laws related to automated overdraft payment programs offered by financial institutions. The CFPB prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service. Financial institutions must also provide consumers with a notice that explains the financial institution’s overdraft services, including the associated fees and the consumer’s choices. In addition, FDIC-supervised institutions must monitor overdraft payment programs for “excessive or chronic” client use and undertake “meaningful and effective” follow-up action with clients that overdraw their accounts more than six times during a rolling 12-month period. Financial institutions must also impose daily limits on overdraft charges, review and modify check-clearing procedures, prominently distinguish account balances from available overdraft coverage amounts, and provide for board and management oversight regarding overdraft payment programs. In response to direct client feedback, Truist offers checking accounts that are not subject to overdraft fees.\nIn December 2024, the CFPB issued a final rule to financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets to either limit the cost of overdraft services to the amount of their costs and losses, or adhere to a fee cap of $5. The rule was expected to take effect on October 1, 2025. Several banking industry groups seeking to invalidate the rule through litigation are arguing, among other things, that the CFPB did not have the statutory authority to issue the rule under the Truth in Lending Act. It is unknown whether the litigation or other government actions in the future will impact the effective date or substance of the rule.\nVolcker Rule\nTruist is prohibited under the Volcker Rule from (i) engaging in proprietary trading activities, and (ii) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with covered private funds. The fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including Truist and its affiliates. The Volcker Rule regulations contain exemptions or exclusions, including for market-making, hedging, underwriting, trading in U.S. government and agency obligations, and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of funds. They also permit the offering and sponsoring of funds under certain conditions. Truist maintains compliance programs in response to the significant compliance obligations mandated by the Volcker Rule regulations.\nRegulatory Regime for Swaps\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive regulatory regime for the OTC swaps market, aimed at increasing transparency, and reducing systemic risk in the derivatives markets, including requirements for central clearing, exchange trading, capital adequacy, margin, reporting, and recordkeeping. The Dodd-Frank Act requires that certain swap dealers and security-based swap dealers register with one or both of the SEC and CFTC, depending on the nature of the swaps business. Truist Bank is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and is conditionally registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer, subjecting Truist Bank to requirements under the CFTC’s and SEC’s regulatory regimes. This includes trade reporting and recordkeeping requirements, business conduct requirements (including daily valuations, disclosure of material risks associated with swaps and disclosure of material incentives and conflicts of interest), and mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements for certain standardized swaps designated by the CFTC. The NFA is the primary self-regulatory organization for Truist’s swap dealer. Truist Bank’s uncleared swaps and security-based swaps are subject to variation margin and initial margin requirements.\nTruist Financial Corporation 15\n\n\nBroker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation\nTruist’s broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the SEC. FINRA is the primary self-regulatory organization for Truist’s registered broker-dealer subsidiaries. Truist’s broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries also are subject to additional regulation by states or local jurisdictions. The SEC and FINRA have active enforcement functions that oversee broker-dealers and investment advisers and can bring actions that result in fines, restitution, a limitation on permitted activities, disqualification to continue to conduct certain activities and an inability to rely on certain favorable exemptions. Certain types of infractions and violations also can affect Truist’s ability to issue new securities expeditiously. In addition, certain changes in the activities of a broker-dealer require approval from FINRA, and FINRA takes into account a variety of considerations in acting upon applications for such approval, including internal controls, capital levels, management experience and quality, prior enforcement and disciplinary history, and supervisory concerns.\nFDIC Recordkeeping Requirements\nTruist is subject to certain enhanced deposit insurance recordkeeping requirements adopted by the FDIC. To facilitate prompt payment of FDIC-insured deposits when large IDIs fail, FDIC rules require IDIs with two million or more deposit accounts to maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity and to develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner by ownership right and capacity.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nTruist is subject to examinations by federal and state banking regulators, as well as the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, NFA, various taxing authorities, and various state securities regulators. Truist periodically receives requests for information on business and accounting practices from regulatory authorities in various states, including state attorneys general, securities regulators, and other regulatory authorities. Such requests are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business.\nHuman Capital\nTruist works as One Team—unified by its purpose, mission, and values—to meet clients’ needs, uplift communities, empower teammates, and promote effective risk management and controls to drive performance. Truist recognizes that attracting the best talent, making investments in teammates, caring to better understand their backgrounds and experiences, and helping to bolster their career trajectories ultimately leads to more engaged and productive teammates, which can contribute to better client service and business outcomes for Truist overall.\nTruist’s Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees Truist’s compensation and benefit programs consistent with its compensation philosophy. This committee provides oversight of Truist’s human capital strategy that supports attracting, developing, and retaining qualified teammates.\nTruist strives to provide rigorous and dynamic talent practices, which develop teammates for success in a broad set of roles.

When a risk factor spans several risk categories, the risks have been listed by their primary risk category. The risks described are not all inclusive. Additional risks that are not presently known or risks deemed immaterial may have an adverse effect on Truist’s financial condition, results of operations, business, and prospects.\nMarket Risks\nThe levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies, general economic and market conditions, including heightened levels of inflation, the political and regulatory environments, business and consumer sentiment, competitive pressures, and expectations about the future, including future changes in interest rates and the frequency and timing of such changes. Refer to the later risk factor titled Changes in monetary, fiscal, and other policies, and changes in the U.S. political environment, could adversely affect us. Our net interest income has in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be adversely affected by policies, laws, and events that have the effect of flattening or inverting the yield curve (that is, the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates), depressing the interest rates associated with our earning assets to levels near the rates associated with our interest expense, increasing the volatility of market rates of interest, including the rate of change, or changing the spreads among different interest rate indices.\nThe levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect us beyond our net interest income, including by increasing the cost or decreasing the availability of deposits or other variable-rate funding instruments, reducing the yield on or demand for loans or increasing the prepayment speed of loans, increasing client or counterparty delinquencies or defaults, and reducing the value of our loans, retained interests in securitizations, and fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio and the efficacy of our hedging strategies. Certain of our investment securities, notably MBS, are sensitive to changes in rates. Generally, when rates rise, market values will decline, prepayments of principal will decrease and the duration of MBS will increase. Conversely, when rates fall, market values will rise, prepayments of principal will increase and the duration of MBS will decrease.\nThe levels of and changes in market rates of interest, and the related risks and uncertainties, are beyond our control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while an accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by spurring economic activity among our clients, such a policy may ultimately cause us more harm by inhibiting our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. A heightened interest rate environment, which we have experienced in recent years and may continue to experience, can pose different challenges, such as potentially slowing the demand for credit, increasing delinquencies and defaults, and reducing the values of our loans and fixed income securities. Market volatility in interest rates, including the rate of change, can create particularly difficult conditions. Refer to the “Market Risk” section of the MD&A and “Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments.”\nThe Company’s hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Company employs various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. The Company’s hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, the Company may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, the Company may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as its hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies. The Company’s hedging strategies are not designed to eliminate all interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks.\n22 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nChanges in monetary, fiscal, and other policies, and changes in the U.S. political environment, could adversely affect us.\nChanges in monetary and fiscal policies, including those established by the FRB and other central banks, and uncertainty concerning the future path of interest rates, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding for the government, and tariffs and other trade policies, can cause volatility in the financial markets and adversely affect our business and operations—for example, the conditions for commercial and consumer lending, the creditworthiness of our clients, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets. Truist cannot control or predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, fiscal, or other policies or the precise effects such changes may have on the Company’s activities and financial results. These policies can:\n•Meaningfully influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, and the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets;\n•Significantly impact the cost of funds, as well as the return on assets, both of which can have an impact on interest income;\n•Adversely affect borrowers through higher debt servicing costs and potentially increase the risk they may fail to repay their loan obligations; and\n•Artificially inflate asset values during prolonged periods of accommodative policy, which could in turn cause volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values during times of restrictive monetary and fiscal policies.\nA fractious or volatile political environment in the U.S., including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. We also could be negatively impacted by political scrutiny of the financial services industry in general or our business or operations in particular.\nFinancial results, lending, and other business activities could be adversely affected by weak or deteriorating economic conditions.\nOur businesses are driven by robust economic and market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. A prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. economy as a whole or in any regional markets that Truist serves, or any deterioration in economic conditions or the financial markets, may disrupt or dampen the economy, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results.\nIf economic conditions deteriorate, the Company could see lower demand for loans by creditworthy clients, reducing the Company’s interest income. In addition, if unemployment levels increase or if real estate prices decrease, the Company could incur higher charge-offs and could incur higher expenses due to increased credit loss provisions. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer borrowers but also commercial and industrial and commercial real estate borrowers, especially for those businesses that rely on the health of industries or properties that may suffer from deteriorating economic conditions. The ability of these borrowers to repay their loans may be reduced, causing the Company to incur higher credit losses. In addition, inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer and clients’ purchasing power, and adversely affect demand for our products and services, reducing the Company’s income.\nA weakening or deterioration of economic conditions also could adversely affect financial results for the Company’s fee-based businesses. Truist earns fee income from, among other activities, investment banking, managing assets for clients, and providing brokerage and other investment advisory and wealth management services. Investment management fees are often based on the value of assets under management and a decrease in the market prices of those assets could reduce the Company’s fee income. Changes in stock or fixed income market prices or client preferences could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other fees earned from the Company’s brokerage business. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial markets would likely adversely affect the Company’s financial advisory and capital markets-related businesses.\nIn addition, the bank failures in 2023 focused market attention on the industry’s interest rate and deposit risks due to rapidly rising interest rates, which, among other things, resulted in unrealized losses on longer duration securities and loans held by banks. A decrease in the supply of deposits or significant increase in competition for deposits could result in substantial increases in costs to retain and service deposits. Increased adoption of consumer banking technology can result in reduced deposit demand due to the relative ease with which depositors may transfer deposits to a different depository institution in the event that the Bank’s products and services are less competitive or confidence is lost in the Bank. The cost of resolving the bank failures in 2023 also prompted the FDIC to issue a special assessment to recover costs to the DIF. Refer to the “Regulatory Considerations” section in Item 1 “Business” for additional details related to the FDIC’s special assessment.\nTruist Financial Corporation 23\n\n\nGeopolitical conditions, the outbreak or escalation of hostilities, acts or threats of terrorism, and related volatility and instability in global economic and market conditions could adversely affect us.\nInstability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, disruptions in foreign relations of the U.S. could adversely affect industries and markets on which our business depends. The macroeconomic environment in the U.S. is susceptible to geopolitical events and volatility in financial markets. For example, trade and other negotiations between the U.S. and other nations remain uncertain and could adversely impact economic and market conditions for the Company and its clients and counterparties.\nGeopolitical conditions, including tensions in foreign relations of the U.S., the outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region, and acts or threats of terrorism, could have an adverse effect on the global economy, financial markets, and on Truist’s business operations. Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyberattacks, could expand or escalate in unpredictable ways, with potentially catastrophic consequences. Geopolitical events and instability could result in worldwide economic disruption, heightened volatility in financial markets, severe declines in asset values, disruption of global trade and supply chains, higher and more volatile commodity and food prices, and diminished consumer, business, and investor confidence. Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on the U.S. economy, and, as a result, Truist’s operations and earnings. Truist, its service providers, and participants in the financial system could also experience increasing levels and more aggressive cyberattacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.\nCredit Risks\nThe Company is subject to credit risk, and the Company’s allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover realized and future losses.\nTruist incurs credit risk, which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising when a borrower, obligor, issuer, or counterparty does not meet its financial obligations to us. Credit risk is primarily incurred through lending activities in the Company’s WB and CSBB operating segments. A number of products expose the Company to credit risk, including loans and leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading assets, and investment securities. Changes in credit quality can have a significant impact on the Company’s earnings and capital position. The Company estimates and establishes contractual lifetime reserves for credit risks and credit losses inherent in its determination of credit exposure. This process, which is critical to the Company’s financial results and condition, requires complex calculations and extensive use of judgment, considering both external and borrower-specific factors that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. If the Company fails to identify all pertinent factors, or fails to accurately estimate the impacts of factors identified, the Company’s allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover realized and future losses.\nCredit losses may exceed the amount of the Company’s reserves due to changing economic conditions, falling collateral values, falling commodity prices, higher unemployment, losses on a client / sector where Truist has an outsized exposure, or other factors such as changes in borrower behavior. There is no assurance that reserves will be sufficient to cover all credit losses. In the event of significant deterioration in current or projected future economic conditions, the Company could experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults. In addition, the Company could be required to increase reserves in future periods, which would reduce the Company’s earnings and potentially impact its capital.\nThe Company could have more credit risk and higher credit losses if our underwriting standards and practices are inadequate, we adopt more liberal underwriting standards for competitive or other reasons, or our concentration and other risk limits are not well calibrated.\nThe Company’s credit risk and credit losses can increase if the Company’s loans are concentrated in borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or in borrowers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic conditions or market conditions, including as a result of climate change or natural disasters. Increased delinquencies or defaults could also result from our failing to appropriately underwrite loans and other products that we originate or purchase or from our adopting—for strategic, competitive, or other reasons—more liberal underwriting standards. There can be no assurance that our forecasts of economic conditions, our assessments and monitoring of credit risk, and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting and investment policies, loss-mitigation strategies, and diversification are or will be sufficient to prevent an adverse impact to our business and financial results.\nThe Company may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in weak, deteriorating, or stressed economic or market conditions.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Company’s credit risk may be further increased if it fails to realize the expected value of the collateral it holds, collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to Truist, or counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons. Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility, or illiquidity, and Truist could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to obtain additional collateral from counterparties, manage declines in the value of collateral, or realize the expected value of collateral.\n24 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nLiquidity Risks\nOur inability to retain and grow deposits or a change in deposit costs or mix could negatively impact our funding strategy and financial results.\nDeposits are a relatively low cost and stable source of funding. Truist competes with banks and other financial institutions for deposits and as a result, the Company could lose deposits in the future, clients may shift their deposits into higher yielding or alternate savings vehicles, or the Company may need to raise interest rates to avoid deposit attrition. Funding costs may also increase if deposits lost are replaced with wholesale funding. Higher funding costs reduce Truist’s net interest margin, net interest income, and net income. For example, in 2024, maintaining and growing deposits continued to be challenging with the FRB continuing to reduce the size of its balance sheet through quantitative tightening and sustained increased interest rates giving clients an incentive to move deposits to money market funds and other higher-yielding alternatives. In addition, our ability to maintain, grow, or favorably price deposits may be constrained by gaps in our product and service offerings, changes in consumer trends, our scale relative to other financial institutions, competition from fintech companies and emerging financial-services providers, any failures or deterioration in our client service, or any loss of confidence in our brand or our business.\nTruist’s liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access short-term funding, an unforeseen outflow of cash, or an inability to monetize liquid assets.\nLiquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable costs. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their reliance on demand or short-term deposits to fund longer-term loans or other extensions of credit. We, like other financial-services companies, rely to a significant extent on external sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings, for the liquidity needed to conduct our business and operations. A number of factors beyond our control, however, could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on our liquidity. When volatility or disruptions occur in the wholesale funding markets, the Company’s ability to access short-term liquidity could be impaired. In addition, idiosyncratic factors, including realization of other risks described herein, as well as other factors outside of the Company’s control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties, could impair the Company’s ability to access short-term or contingent funding sources or create an unforeseen outflow of cash due to, among other factors, draws on unfunded commitments or deposit attrition. The Company’s inability to monetize liquid assets without unacceptable losses or to access short-term funding or capital markets could constrain the Company’s ability to make new loans or meet existing lending commitments and could ultimately jeopardize the Company’s overall liquidity and capitalization. While our policies and controls are designed to enable us to maintain adequate liquidity to conduct our business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment, our liquidity position could still become compromised. Such an event could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt regulatory intervention and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of client and investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened.\nA disruption in our access to the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for liquidity could negatively affect us.\nTruist sells a portion of the mortgage loans that it originates to reduce the Company’s retained credit risk and to provide funding capacity for originating additional loans. The GSEs could limit their purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints or other changes in their eligibility criteria for conforming loans (e.g., maximum loan amount or borrower eligibility). This potential reduction in purchases could limit the Company’s ability to fund new loans.\nProposals have been presented to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The extent and timing of any such regulatory reform of the housing finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on the Company’s business and financial results, are uncertain.\nThe Company’s cost of funding or access to the banking and capital markets could be adversely affected if our credit ratings are downgraded or otherwise fail to meet investor expectations.\nCredit ratings are influenced by many factors, including the Company’s profitability, asset quality, capital levels, liquidity, business mix, operations, and risk management practices. Credit ratings may also be influenced by other factors, some of which are outside the Company’s control, such as recent and anticipated economic trends, geopolitical risk, legislative and regulatory developments, including implied levels of government support during a crisis, environmental, social, and governance considerations, and litigation, as well as changes to the rating agencies’ methodologies. There can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our current ratings and outlooks. Truist’s failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect funding costs and increase the Company’s cost of capital. A ratings downgrade could affect the Company’s ability to attract or retain funding, including deposits from commercial and corporate clients. Additionally, a downgrade to Truist’s credit ratings might also adversely impact the Company’s ability to conduct derivatives business with certain clients and counterparties and could trigger obligations to make cash or collateral payments to certain clients and counterparties.\nTruist Financial Corporation 25\n\n\nThe Parent Company could have less access to funding sources and its liquidity could be constrained if the Bank becomes unable to pay dividends.\nThe Parent Company relies upon capital markets access and dividends from affiliates for funding and has less access to contingent funding sources than the Bank. If the Bank were subject to a financial stress, its dividends to the Parent Company could be reduced or eliminated in order to support Bank capital ratios or other regulatory requirements. This would increase the Parent Company’s reliance on capital markets at a time when credit spreads and funding costs are likely elevated due to the stress impacting the Bank and would also impair the Parent Company’s ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries.\nThe financial system is highly interrelated, and financial or systemic shocks or the failure of even a single financial institution or other participant in the financial system could adversely impact us.\nAdverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of other financial institutions, the financial services industry as a whole, the macroeconomic climate, and the U.S. Treasury market could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments. In addition, adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships could also negatively impact perceptions about us. These perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face.\nTruist may be impacted by actual or perceived soundness of other financial institutions, including as a result of the financial or operational failure of a major financial institution, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a financial institution or its ability to fulfill its obligations, which can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the financial markets and increased expenses, including FDIC insurance premiums or special assessments, and could affect our ability to attract and retain depositors and to borrow or raise capital. The failure of other banks and financial institutions and the measures taken by governments, businesses, and other organizations in response to these events could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. Truist has exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, central counterparties, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional investors and clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally, in the past have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by Truist or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of the Company’s counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by Truist cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the Company’s exposure. Any such losses could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nTechnology Risks\nThe Company’s operating systems and infrastructure, as well as operational capabilities managed or supplied by third parties on whom we rely, could fail or be interrupted, which could disrupt the Company’s business and adversely impact the Company’s operations, financial condition, prospects, and reputation, and cause significant legal and financial exposure.\nThe Company’s operational and security systems, networks, and infrastructure, including computer systems and networks, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to the Company’s performance. The Company’s business relies on the secure collection, transmission, storage, use, retrieval, and other processing of confidential, proprietary, and other sensitive information in the Company’s information systems, networks and those of third parties. In addition, to access the Company’s systems, networks, products, and services, the Company’s clients and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of the Company’s control and network environments. The Company’s operating systems and infrastructure are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failure, and human error. These risks may increase in the future as Truist continues to evolve its internal and external operating systems and infrastructure. \n26 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout the Company’s business, and because of the Company’s interactions with and reliance on third parties, is not limited to the Company’s own internal operational functions. Truist’s vendors, service providers, and other third parties may expose the Company to risk as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, or a failure or breach of systems, networks, and infrastructure. In addition, third-party system breakdowns or failures, could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Company or result in lost or compromised information of the Company or its clients. Truist cannot be certain that it will receive timely notification of such incidents or be able to exert any meaningful control or influence over how and when they are addressed. The Company’s ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any such significant disruptions to third parties with whom the Company interacts or relies upon.\nIn addition, as a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems and networks, a technology failure that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems, networks, or data of one or more financial entities could have an adverse impact on counterparties or other market participants. This consolidation, interconnectivity, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect the Company’s ability to conduct transactions, service the Company’s clients, manage the Company’s exposure to risk, or expand the Company’s business.\nTruist is heavily reliant on technology, and a failure to effectively anticipate, develop, and implement new technology could negatively impact our financial results, business, operations, or security.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including those related to AI and migration to the cloud. Truist has invested in technology to automate functions previously performed manually, to facilitate the ability of clients to engage in financial transactions and otherwise to enhance the client experience with respect to the Company’s products and services.\nTruist expects to make additional investments in innovation and technology to address technological disruption in the industry and improve client offerings and service. Although changes are designed to allow the Company to better serve the Company’s clients and to reduce costs, many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial financial, human, and other resources. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, they are not always implemented, and may not in the future be implemented, on time, within budget, or without negative financial, operational, or client impact. In addition, these initiatives do not always perform, and may not in the future perform, as we or our clients expect.\nThe Company’s continued success depends, in part, upon the Company’s ability to address clients’ needs by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy client demands, including demands for faster, simpler, and more secure payment services, to create efficiencies in the Company’s operations, and to integrate those offerings with legacy platforms or to update those legacy platforms. A failure to maintain or enhance the Company’s competitive position with respect to technology, whether because of a failure to anticipate client expectations or keep pace with new or enhanced product or service offerings by competitors, a failure in the performance of technological developments, or an untimely roll out of developments, may cause the Company to lose market share or incur additional expense.\nOur use of systems and other technologies also depends on rights or interests in the underlying intellectual property, which we or our service providers may own or license. If we or a service provider were alleged or found to be infringing on the intellectual-property rights of another person or entity, we could be liable for significant damages for past infringement, substantial fees for continued use, and deprivation of access to or use of such intellectual property for limited or extended periods of time without the practical availability of an alternative, or we could enter into a settlement agreement to resolve such claims. For example, in 2023 we settled a lawsuit brought by another financial institution alleging that our mobile remote deposit capture systems infringed patents owned by the other financial institution.\nThe Company faces risks associated with the quality, availability, and retention of key data for operational, strategic, regulatory, and compliance purposes.\nThe Company’s financial and regulatory reporting, public disclosures, and key business decisions are reliant on the quality, availability, and retention of data, including personal information. A control failure, for example, may lead to data breaches, data loss, data misuse, and data integrity and quality risks. These failures may result in inaccuracies in financial and regulatory reports, inhibited management decision-making, financial loss, reputational risk, and regulatory compliance risk, including data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity compliance risks. We also can experience enforcement and other supervisory actions, damage to our reputation, and private litigation as a result of these failures.\nTruist Financial Corporation 27\n\n\nThe Company and its suppliers and service providers face a wide array of cybersecurity risks, which could result in the loss, alteration, or disclosure of confidential, proprietary, personal, and other sensitive information; adversely impact the Company’s operations, financial condition, prospects, and reputation; and cause significant legal and financial exposure.\nThe Company’s computer systems and network infrastructure and those of its suppliers and service providers are continuously targeted in cyberattacks and vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, fraud, denial of service attacks, social engineering schemes (such as phishing), hacking, malware or ransomware intrusion, data corruption attempts, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Such incidents have exposed and may continue to expose security vulnerabilities in the Company’s systems, networks, or other security measures, or those of third parties, and have resulted and could result in the unauthorized access, gathering, monitoring, misuse, release, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, or other sensitive information, including personal information. Such incidents could also damage the Company’s systems and networks by introducing material disruptions to the network access or business operations of the Company, its clients, or other third parties.\nIn addition, Truist’s clients, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to and will continue to be the target of cyberattacks and other similar incidents. The Company also faces cybersecurity risks relating to partners and other third parties that the Company relies upon to facilitate or enable business activities, including vendors, service providers, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. While the Company performs cybersecurity due diligence on its vendors and service providers, the Company does not control its vendors or service providers and its ability to monitor their cybersecurity is limited. Therefore, the Company cannot ensure that the cybersecurity measures they take will be sufficient to protect information the Company shares with them or prevent disruption arising from a cyberattack. In addition, the existence of cyberattacks or security breaches at third-party vendors and service providers with access to the Company’s data and systems may not be disclosed to the Company in a timely manner.\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years and will likely continue to increase, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to facilitate and conduct financial transactions. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, state-sponsored actors, disgruntled teammates or vendors, hackers, activists, and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage, any of which may see their effectiveness enhanced by the use of AI, including the use of generative AI to conduct more sophisticated social engineering attacks on the Company or its clients. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cybersecurity threat actors change frequently and may not be recognized until launched or well after a breach has occurred. \nA successful penetration or circumvention of system or network security could cause serious negative consequences, including loss of clients and business opportunities; costs associated with maintaining business relationships after a cyberattack or security breach; significant disruption to the Company’s operations and business; misappropriation, exposure or destruction of the Company’s confidential, proprietary, and other sensitive information, including personal information, and funds and those of the Company’s clients; damage to the Company’s or the Company’s clients’ or third parties’ computers, systems, or networks; and a violation of applicable laws and regulations, including those related to data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity. This could result in litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties, loss of confidence in the Company’s security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, which could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from any of the foregoing, our existing insurance coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all, and our insurers may deny coverage as to any future claims.\nIn addition, cybersecurity and data-privacy risks have received heightened legislative, regulatory, and supervisory attention. Legislation and regulations on cybersecurity and data privacy, as well as related supervisory expectations, can compel us to enhance or modify our systems and infrastructure, invest in new systems and infrastructure, change our service providers, augment our scenario and vulnerability testing, and alter our business practices or our policies on security, data governance, and privacy. Any of these, in turn, can cause a significant increase in the complexity and costs of our operations and expose us to enforcement and other supervisory actions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, reputational damage, and a loss of client or investor confidence.\n28 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nOther External Risks\nPhysical, transition, and other risks associated with climate change, together with governmental responses to them, may negatively impact our business, operations, reputation, and clients.\nClimate change presents physical risks from the direct impacts of changing climate patterns and acute weather events, such as damage to physical assets and service disruptions, and transition risks from changes in regulations, disruptive technologies, and shifting market dynamics towards a lower carbon economy. The physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding, hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Physical risks may alter the Company’s strategic direction in order to mitigate certain financial risks. Such events could also disrupt the Company’s operations or those of its clients or third parties the Company relies on, not only through direct damage to assets, but also from indirect impacts due to supply chain disruption and market volatility. Physical risks ultimately could result in declines in asset values (which could be exacerbated by specific portfolio or geographic concentrations), reduced availability and therefore increased costs of insurance for our clients and third parties, interruptions of supply chains and business operations, and population migration or depressed economies and increased unemployment in affected regions, any or all of which could result in increased credit risk to Truist or have other negative impacts.\nTransition risks, including changes in consumer preferences, longer-term shifts in market dynamics, additional regulatory requirements or taxes, and additional counterparty or client requirements, could have an adverse impact on asset values and the financial performance of Truist’s businesses, and those of its clients, and could be exacerbated in specific industries that may be more sensitive or vulnerable to a transition to a low carbon economy. Climate change could also present incremental risks to the execution of the Company’s long-term strategy. While material impact from climate change is expected to occur over a longer time horizon, the acceleration of a transition to a low-carbon economy could present idiosyncratic risks for individual companies. Additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy will entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market initiatives. Transition risks could result in the sudden devaluation of assets, increased costs for energy and operations, and therefore could have unforeseen and negative consequences on business models for us, our clients and other third parties.\nGovernments have been focused on the effects of climate change and environmental issues, and how they act to mitigate related risks could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. This focus could ultimately result in legislation or regulations that could, among other things: directly or indirectly compel us to alter our businesses or operations in ways that would be detrimental to our results of operations and prospects; negatively impact our capital plans; or cause us to incur additional capital, compliance, and other costs.\nAdditionally, the Company faces potential reputational risks as a result of its practices related to climate change, including as a result of the Company’s direct or indirect involvement, or lack of involvement, in certain industries, as well as any decisions management makes in response to managing climate risk, especially as views on climate-related matters become subject to increased polarization. Further, there is increased scrutiny of climate change-related policies, goals, and disclosures, which could result in litigation and regulatory investigations and actions or reputational damage. We may incur additional costs and require additional resources as we evolve our strategy, practices, and related disclosures with respect to these matters.\nThe Company is at risk of increased losses from fraud.\nIncreased and evolving activity perpetrated by bad actors intending to defraud, misappropriate property, or circumvent the law using different channels, products. and means may outpace and outmaneuver the Truist control environment and monitoring activities impacting clients, teammates, and stakeholders. Fraud attacks in the banking sector have surged in recent years, driven by increasingly sophisticated and rapid techniques. Many bad actors, often linked to large criminal organizations, share strategies to execute schemes, such as debit and credit card fraud, peer-to-peer payment fraud, counterfeit checks, social engineering, ATM skimming, and phishing, and recent advances in artificial intelligence may make it more difficult to detect fraud. Fraudulent schemes exploit products like real-time payments, ACH, and wire transfers to steal funds. Fraudsters impersonate legitimate clients using stolen identities, employ other individuals to interact with Truist, or create fraudulent identities. In some cases, fraud is even committed by existing clients. A failure to detect, prevent, and address fraud could result in financial loss to the Company or its clients, loss of confidence in the Company’s security measures, client dissatisfaction, litigation exposure, regulatory investigations, fines, penalties or intervention, reimbursement, or other compensatory costs (including the costs of credit monitoring services), additional compliance costs, and harm to the Company’s reputation, all of which could adversely affect the Company.\nTruist Financial Corporation 29\n\n\nNatural disasters, pandemics, and other catastrophic events could adversely impact us.\nThe occurrence of, or increased severity and frequency of, natural disasters, extreme weather events, health crises, disease outbreaks or pandemics, or other catastrophic events, as well as government actions or other restrictions in connection with such events, could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Truist has significant operations and clients along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts as well as other regions of the U.S., which could be adversely impacted by hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, tornadoes, and other severe weather in those areas. Rising insurance costs as well as decreasing insurance provider options resulting from natural disasters, extreme weather events, and other catastrophic events could cause supply chain issues, population migration, or the weakening of economic conditions in certain regions. In addition, natural and other types of disasters, including as a result of climate change, could disrupt the Company’s operations or the ability or willingness of the Company’s clients to access the financial services offered by Truist, and could adversely impact Company borrowers’ ability to timely repay their loans and the value of any collateral held. These events could reduce the Company’s earnings and cause volatility in the Company’s financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Although Truist has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there can be no assurance that such business continuity plans will be effective.\nCompliance Risks\nTruist is subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe banking and financial services industries are highly regulated. Truist is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by regulators, including the FRB, FDIC, NCCOB, SEC, CFTC, CFPB, FINRA, MSRB, NFA, and various other federal and state regulatory agencies. The regulatory and supervisory framework applicable to banking organizations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and other customers, the DIF, the broader economy, and the stability of the U.S. financial system, rather than for the protection of shareholders and non-deposit creditors. In addition to banking statutes, regulations, and other laws, Truist is subject to various other laws that directly or indirectly affect its business and operations, including its ability to make distributions to shareholders. Governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations also issue policy statements, interpretive letters, guidance, and other documents and communications that similarly impact Truist. The scope, complexity, intensity, and interpretation of these laws, documents, communications, and actions can vary based on such factors as the state of the economy, the prevailing political environment, and the performance of business and operations by us and other financial institutions.\nTruist is also subject to heightened requirements under the enhanced prudential standards and increased supervisory scrutiny, including, for example, single counterparty credit limits, heightened expectations with respect to governance, risk management and internal controls, and additional capital and liquidity requirements.\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, rules, and regulations varying across Truist’s lines of business, corporate functions, and jurisdictions, and include risks related to financial products and services, relationships and interactions with clients, and teammate activities. Compliance risks include those associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, and the laws, rules, and regulations related to the offering of financial products and services. Compliance risk is also inherent in Truist’s fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care to act in the best interest of fiduciary clients or to treat fiduciary clients fairly.\nThe regulation and supervision of Truist significantly affects the way that we conduct our business and operations. Laws and regulations that are applicable to us, and Truist’s inability to act in certain instances without receiving prior regulatory approval, affect Truist’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to repurchase common stock, and ability to pursue strategic acquisitions, among other activities. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation and the continued heightening of regulatory requirements could affect Truist in substantial and unpredictable ways. Federal and state banking regulators also possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These supervisory actions may result in higher capital and liquidity requirements, higher deposit insurance premiums, higher compliance expenses, changes to our business or operations, and monetary penalties. These actions could also negatively impact the products and services that we offer and our ability to engage in business opportunities. The restrictions imposed by any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our operations, strategy, profitability, and reputation.\nTruist has elected to be treated as an FHC, which permits us to engage in a number of financial and related activities beyond banking, including securities, advisory, and merchant banking activities. Truist and Truist Bank are subject to ongoing requirements for Truist to qualify as an FHC. If a BHC or any of its insured depository institutions were found not to be well capitalized or well managed, as defined under applicable law, the BHC can be restricted from engaging in the broader range of financial and related activities permitted for FHCs, including the ability to acquire companies engaged in those activities, and can be required to discontinue these activities or even divest any of its insured depository institutions. In addition, if an insured-depository-institution subsidiary of a BHC were to fail to achieve a satisfactory or better rating under the CRA, the ability of the BHC to expand its financial and related activities or make acquisitions could be restricted.\n30 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nFinancial regulators’ prudential and supervisory authority gives them broad power and discretion to direct Truist’s actions, and they have assumed an active oversight, examination, and enforcement role across the financial services industry on both the federal and state levels. Areas of focus in the recent past have been with respect to climate change, deposits, interest-rate risk management, commercial real estate, risk governance and controls, capital, liquidity, long-term debt requirements, consumer loan practices, data privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, overdraft and other fees, retention and recordkeeping of electronic communications, reimbursement for fraudulent transactions, and other compliance matters.\nTruist must comply with laws and regulations relating to AML, economic sanctions, embargo programs, and anti-corruption, which can increase its risks of non-compliance and costs associated with the implementation and maintenance of complex compliance programs. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the financial system, consumers, and financial institutions from bad actors and illicit activities by requiring financial institutions to develop and implement programs designed to deter and when possible detect and prevent the use of the financial system to facilitate the funding of criminal activities. Federal law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal financial institution regulators, OFAC, and the U.S. DOJ, among other government agencies, with respect to these laws and regulations. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to: assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines, or restitution; issue cease and desist or prohibition orders; and initiate injunctive actions against financial institutions and institution-affiliated parties, including individual teammates. These enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations or unsafe and unsound practices. Additionally, actual or alleged misconduct by teammates, including unethical, fraudulent, improper, or illegal conduct, or unfair, deceptive, abusive, or discriminatory practices, can result in litigation, or government investigations and enforcement actions, and cause significant reputational harm to Truist, even if allegations are ultimately unsubstantiated.\nThe Company and other large financial institutions have become subject to increased scrutiny, more intense supervision and regulation, and more supervisory findings and actions, with increased operational and compliance costs, as well as impacts on geographic expansion and acquisitions, which may continue. The financial services industry has faced and may continue to face a stricter and more aggressive enforcement of laws at federal, state, and local levels—particularly in connection with business and other practices that may harm or appear to harm consumers or affect the financial system more broadly. Truist expects to remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. Any potential new regulations or modifications to existing regulations would likely necessitate changes to Truist’s existing regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure and could result in increased compliance costs.\nOur regulatory and supervisory environments, whether at federal, state, or local levels, are not static. No assurance can be given that applicable statutes, regulations, and other laws will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws will not be adopted, or that any of these laws will not be enforced more aggressively, including as a result of changes to control of branches of the U.S. government. Truist could become subject to future legislation and regulatory requirements beyond those currently proposed, adopted, or contemplated in the U.S. or abroad, including limits on acquisitions, more stringent capital and liquidity requirements, policies and rulemaking related to emerging technologies, cybersecurity, and data, and climate risk management, governance, and reporting, including emissions and sustainability disclosure. In addition, concerns over climate change may prompt changes in regulations that, in turn, could have an adverse impact on asset values and the financial performance of Truist’s businesses and its clients. The cumulative effect of such legislation and regulations on Truist’s business, operations, and profitability cannot be accurately predicted. Such regulatory changes may reduce Truist’s revenues, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer, alter the investments it makes, affect the manner in which it operates its businesses, increase its litigation and regulatory costs, and increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products. Further, our noncompliance with applicable laws, whether as a result of changes in interpretation or enforcement, system or human errors, or otherwise and, in some cases, regardless of whether noncompliance was inadvertent, can result in the suspension or revocation of authority to conduct business operations and in the initiation of supervisory actions, enforcement proceedings, or private litigation.\nTruist also relies upon third parties who may expose the Company to compliance and legal risk. New or existing legal requirements also could heighten the reputational impact of perceived misuses of client data by the Company and third parties. See additional disclosures in the “Regulatory Considerations” section in Item 1 “Business.”\nRegulatory capital and liquidity standards and future revisions to them may negatively impact our business and financial results.\nTruist is subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements established by the FRB and the FDIC. These regulatory capital and liquidity requirements are typically developed at an international level by the BCBS and then applied, with adjustments, in each country by the appropriate domestic regulatory bodies. Domestic regulatory agencies have the ability to apply stricter capital and liquidity standards than those developed by the BCBS. In several instances, the U.S. banking agencies have done so with respect to U.S. banking organizations.\nTruist Financial Corporation 31\n\n\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of capital and liquidity and regulatory expectations as to the quality of the Company’s capital and liquidity may prevent the Company from taking advantage of opportunities in the best interest of shareholders or force the Company to take actions contrary to their interests. For example, Truist may be limited in its ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. In addition, these requirements may impact the amount and type of loans the Company is able to make. Truist may be constrained in its ability to expand, either organically or through mergers and acquisitions. These requirements may cause the Company to sell or refrain from acquiring assets where the capital requirements appear inconsistent with the assets’ underlying risks. In addition, liquidity standards require the Company to maintain holdings of highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the Company’s ability to invest in less liquid assets, even if more desirable from a balance sheet return or interest rate risk management perspective. As a Category III banking organization, Truist is subject to additional capital and liquidity requirements. For example, Truist is subject to a requirement to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve for review that include, among other things, projected dividend payments and repurchases of capital stock. As part of the capital planning and stress testing processes, our capital actions are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirements in the event of a stressed market environment. If we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirements, including the SCB, our ability to undertake capital actions may be restricted.\nIn addition to the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to Truist and Truist Bank, the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements established by the SEC.\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements receive periodic review and revision by the BCBS and the U.S. banking agencies. Proposed changes to applicable capital and liquidity requirements, such as the Basel III proposal and the long-term debt proposal, could result in increased expenses or cost of funding, which could negatively affect our financial results or our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchases. For more information concerning our legal and regulatory obligations with respect to Basel III and long-term debt requirements, please see “Regulatory Considerations” in Item 1 “Business.”\nTruist is subject to risks related to originating and selling loans, including repurchase and indemnification obligations.\nWhen loans are sold or securitized, it is customary to make representations and warranties to the purchaser about the loans, including the manner in which they were originated, and to agree to repurchase the loans or indemnify the buyer in the event of a breach of the sale agreement, including a breach of these representations or warranties. An increase in the number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers related to representations and warranties on sold loans could result in an increase in the amount of losses for loan repurchases. Truist also bears a risk of loss from borrower defaults for multi-family commercial mortgage loans sold to FNMA.\nIn addition to repurchase claims from GSEs, Truist could be subject to indemnification claims from non-GSE purchasers of the Company’s loans. Claims could be made if the loans sold fail to conform to statements about their quality, the manner in which the loans were originated and underwritten, or their compliance with state and federal law.\nAdditional factors affecting the extent to which we may securitize loans and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and receivables, the demand for consumer asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. In addition, proposals regarding reform to the U.S. housing finance market could impact our decisions regarding which loans should be securitized in the future.\nTruist faces risks as a servicer of loans.\nThe Company acts as servicer for a range of assets and products, primarily for loans in securitizations and unsecuritized loans owned by investors. As servicer for loans, the Company has certain contractual obligations to the securitization trusts, investors, or other third parties, including foreclosing on defaulted loans or, to the extent consistent with the applicable securitization or other investor agreement, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales. Generally, the Company’s servicing obligations are set by contract, for which the Company receives a contractual fee. However, GSEs can amend their servicing guidelines unilaterally for certain government guaranteed mortgages, which can increase the scope or costs of the services required without any corresponding increase in the Company’s servicing fee. Federal and state laws that impose additional servicing requirements could increase the scope and cost of the Company’s servicing obligations. As a servicer, the Company also advances expenses on behalf of investors, which it may be unable to collect.\n32 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nA material breach of the Company’s obligations as servicer may result in contract termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing the Company to lose servicing income. In addition, the Company may be required to indemnify the securitization trustee or other holder of the loan against losses from any failure by the Company, as a servicer, to perform the Company’s servicing obligations or any act or omission on the Company’s part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. For certain investors and certain transactions, Truist may be contractually obligated to repurchase a loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. The Company may be subject to increased repurchase or indemnity obligations as a result of claims made that the Company did not satisfy its obligations as a servicer. The Company may also experience increased loss severity on repurchases, which may require a material increase to the Company’s repurchase reserve. While the number of such indemnification claims has been small, these could increase in the future.\nTruist faces substantial risks in safeguarding personal and other sensitive information.\nTruist’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules, and regulations governing data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, particularly with respect to the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. Individuals whose personal information may be protected by law can include the Company’s clients (and in some cases its clients’ clients), prospective clients, job applicants, teammates, and the employees of the Company’s vendors, and other third parties. Complying with the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the Company’s disclosure, collection, use, sharing, storage, and other processing of personal information can increase operating costs, impact the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency. Any mishandling or misuse of personal information by the Company or a third-party affiliated with the Company could expose the Company to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions.\nAdditional risks could arise from the failure of the Company or third parties to provide adequate disclosure or transparency to the Company’s clients about the personal information collected from them and the use of such information; to receive, document, and honor the privacy preferences expressed by the Company’s clients; to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure; or to maintain training on data privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity practices for all teammates or third parties who have access to personal information. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of Truist’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause Truist to lose existing or potential clients, and thereby reduce Truist’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by the Company to comply with applicable data privacy, data protection, or cybersecurity laws, rules, or regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations, and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions. Any of these could damage Truist’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the inappropriate disclosure, collection, use, sharing, storage, and other processing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information by companies. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules, and regulations relating to the disclosure, collection, use, sharing, storage, and other processing of personal information. Truist will likely be subject to new and evolving data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity laws, rules, and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, which could result in additional costs of compliance, litigation, regulatory fines, and enforcement actions. These types of laws, rules, and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as Truist from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict Truist’s use of personal information when developing or offering products or services to clients. These restrictions could also inhibit Truist’s development or marketing of certain products or services or increase the costs of offering them to clients.\nFor more information concerning our legal and regulatory obligations with respect to data privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity, please see “Privacy, Data Protection, and Cybersecurity” in Item 1 “Business.”\nDifferences in regulation and supervision can affect the Company’s ability to compete effectively.\nThe content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. Large institutions, such as the Company, often are subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and supervision than smaller institutions. In addition, financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same regulatory priorities or supervisory requirements as the Company’s regulators. These differences in regulation can impair the Company’s ability to compete effectively with competitors that are less regulated and do not have similar compliance costs.\nTruist Financial Corporation 33\n\n\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nThe Company may incur damages, fines, penalties, and other negative consequences from past, current, or future supervisory actions and regulatory or other legal violations, including inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nTruist maintains systems and procedures designed to support its compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective. In addition to fines and penalties, the Company may suffer other negative consequences from supervisory actions and regulatory violations, including restrictions on certain activities and damage to the Company’s reputation, which in turn might adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.\nFederal and state law grants substantial enforcement and supervisory powers to federal and state banking regulators and law enforcement agencies if the regulated entities fail to comply with applicable laws or to maintain a risk and control environment that meets the standards and expectations of the regulators. This enforcement and supervisory authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines, or restitution; to issue cease and desist or removal orders; to issue formal and informal enforcement orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties. These enforcement and supervisory actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations or unsafe and unsound practices. In addition, governmental authorities have, at times, sought criminal penalties against companies in the financial services sector for violations, and, at times, have required an admission of wrongdoing, criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms from financial institutions in connection with resolving such matters. Criminal convictions or criminal pleas or admissions of wrongdoing in a settlement with the government can lead to greater exposure in civil litigation, reputational harm, and other significant collateral consequences, such as restrictions on engaging in new activities or acquisitions, loss of clients, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time.\nThe Company could become subject to a significant regulatory investigation or supervisory action and be unable to disclose specific information concerning it to the public if such a disclosure would violate the Company’s obligations under applicable rules and regulations to maintain the confidentiality of confidential supervisory information. Regulatory investigations, examinations or other initiatives by governmental authorities may subject the Company to litigation, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require the Company to engage in remediation, provide restitution to customers or to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. Any of these potential outcomes could harm the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects or reputation or could result in collateral or ancillary consequences. In addition, our exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the Company’s accruals for those matters.\nPending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of its business, the Company is subject to lawsuits, claims, and formal and informal enforcement activity, including regulatory investigations, either directly or indirectly through our ownership interests in other entities. The volume of legal proceedings against participants in the financial services industry, including the Company, is substantial, and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities are becoming more common in the current regulatory environment. Legal proceedings against financial services firms may increase depending on factors such as market downturns, changes in law, and increased regulatory scrutiny.\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny or the results of an investigation or examination may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Those actions could result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against Truist. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings by multiple federal and state agencies and officials. In addition, if one or more financial institutions are found to have violated a law or regulation relating to certain business activities, this could lead to investigations by regulators or other governmental agencies of the same or similar activities by other financial institutions, including Truist, and large fines and remedial measures that may have been imposed in resolving earlier investigations for the same or similar activities at other financial institutions may be used as the basis for future settlements.\nTruist can also be subject to lawsuits, claims, and enforcement activity indirectly through its ownership of interests in other entities. These other entities can themselves be subject to government regulation, supervision, and examination, and their failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or regulatory requirements or expectations could have negative consequences for Truist, including a decrease in the value of Truist’s investment in the other entity, damage to Truist’s reputation from being an owner or otherwise associated with the other entity, or a requirement for Truist and the other owners to contribute funds to pay for judgments, settlements, fines, or client redress arising from the lawsuits, claims, or enforcement activity. Failure by another entity in which Truist has an ownership stake to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or regulatory requirements or expectations could also lead to lawsuits, claims, or enforcement activity directly against the owners of the other entity, including Truist.\n34 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nClaims and legal actions, including class action lawsuits and enforcement proceedings, could involve large monetary amounts, significant defense costs, and result in settlements, judgments, or orders that include penalties, fines, injunctions, or other forms of relief that are adverse to the Company. Responding to inquiries, investigations, lawsuits, and other proceedings is time-consuming and expensive and can divert senior management attention from Truist’s business.\nThe outcome of any such legal proceedings, as well as the timing of any ultimate resolutions, may be difficult to predict or estimate. Actual legal and other costs arising from claims and legal actions may be greater than the Company’s accruals. Further, the Company may not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of significant loss. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding or significant regulatory or government action against the Company could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition or cause significant reputational harm, which may adversely impact the Company’s business prospects. Further, the Company may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Refer to the Legal Proceedings and Other Matters section in “Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies” for additional information.\nStrategic Risks\nIneffective execution of strategic initiatives could adversely affect investor sentiment and our business and financial results.\nThere is no guarantee that our strategic initiatives, including initiatives to drive focused growth, achieve operational excellence and efficiency, and leverage modern and scalable technology, will be successful and improve profitability or allow us to return capital to shareholders. Our execution of strategic initiatives may be impacted by internal factors, such as maintaining a level of earnings appropriate to support growth objectives, the ability to maintain dividends in various economic cycles, or the successful delivery of innovation and technology strategies. In addition, our execution of our strategies may be impacted by our response to external factors, including geopolitical, macroeconomic, social, cultural, competitive, and regulatory factors. To the extent we are impeded or unable to execute effective strategic initiatives, our prospects for growth, earnings, capital levels, and stock price, as well as stakeholder confidence in Truist, could be adversely affected.\nCompetition may reduce Truist’s client base or cause Truist to modify the pricing or other terms for products and services, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nTruist operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive with growth in areas such as digital financial service providers and other nonbank platforms. Increased competition could arise from technological advancements, legislative and regulatory changes, as well as competition from other financial services companies, some of which may be subject to less extensive regulation than Truist. The Company’s success depends, in part, on the Company’s ability to adapt its offering of products and services to evolving industry standards and client expectations. The widespread adoption of new technologies has required and will continue to require substantial investments to modify existing products and services or to develop new products and services. In addition, there is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices further reducing contribution margins. The Company may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology or those new products may not achieve market acceptance.\nTruist also competes with nonbank companies and, in some cases, with companies other than those traditionally considered financial sector participants. In particular, technology companies are increasingly focusing on the financial sector, either in partnership with competitor banking organizations or on their own. These companies generally are not subject to the same regulatory oversight as main street financial institutions and may accordingly realize certain cost strategies and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the client. This competition could result in the loss of clients and revenue in areas where fintechs are operating. As the pace of technology and change advance, continuous innovation is expected to exert long-term pressure on the financial services industry.\nThe adoption of new technologies by competitors, including internet banking services, mobile applications, advanced ATM functionality, AI, and cryptocurrencies, could require the Company to make substantial investments to modify or adapt the Company’s existing products and services or even radically alter the way Truist conducts business. These and other capital investments in the Company’s business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure.\nTruist Financial Corporation 35\n\n\nAcquisitions, mergers, and divestitures introduce a broad range of anticipated and unanticipated risks, including unforeseen or negative consequences from supervisory or regulatory action that may limit Truist’s ability to pursue and complete them.\nWe may from time to time seek to acquire other financial-services companies or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including inaccurate financial and operational assumptions, incomplete or failed due diligence, lower than expected performance, higher than expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management’s attention from other business activities, adverse market or other reactions, changes in relationships with clients or counterparties, the potential loss of key personnel, and the possibility of litigation and other disputes. An acquisition also could be dilutive to our existing shareholders if we were to issue common stock to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. We, moreover, may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing expected value from acquisitions. There is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and we may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms. No assurance can be given that we will pursue future acquisitions, and our ability to grow and successfully compete may be impaired if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions.\nThe Company must satisfy a number of meaningful conditions before completing an acquisition of another bank or BHC, including federal and state regulatory approvals. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank or BHC acquisition, bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition; financial condition and future prospects, including current and projected capital ratios and levels; the competence, experience, and integrity of management; the supervisory relationship; record of compliance with laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the CRA; the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities; and public comments. In addition, U.S. regulators must take systemic risk to the U.S. financial system into account when evaluating whether to approve a potential acquisition transaction involving a large financial institution like Truist. There is no certainty as to when or if or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted for any potential acquisition. In specific cases, Truist may be required to divest certain operations, including branches, or take other actions as a condition to receiving regulatory approval. An inability to satisfy other conditions necessary to consummate an acquisition transaction, such as third-party litigation, a judicial order blocking the transaction, or lack of shareholder approval, could also prevent the Company from completing an announced acquisition.\nIn addition, we may decide to divest certain businesses or assets. Divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, and any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Divestitures may involve significant uncertainty and execution complexity, which may cause us not to achieve our strategic objectives, realize expected cost savings, or obtain other benefits from the divestiture. The significant risks and uncertainties involved in divestitures may include:\n•the inability to sell such businesses or assets on satisfactory price and terms and in a timely manner, including potentially long and costly sales processes and unsuccessful attempts by a buyer to receive required regulatory approvals, satisfy other conditions to closing, or obtain equity or debt financing in order to satisfy its payment obligations related to the transaction,\n•disruption to other parts of our business and distraction of management,\n•loss of key teammates or clients,\n•exposure to contingencies, including, among other things, those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses being sold, or\n•ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, including through transition services arrangements, and other adverse financial impacts.\nWhether such divestitures are completed or not, their pendency could have a number of negative effects on our current business, including potentially disrupting our regular operations and diverting the attention of our workforce and management team. It could also disrupt existing business relationships, make it harder to develop new business relationships, or otherwise negatively impact the way that we operate our business. In the event of a termination of a divestiture transaction before it is consummated, the payment of a termination fee may not fully compensate us for our losses.\nTruist has businesses other than banking that are subject to a variety of risks.\nTruist is a diversified financial services company. This diversity subjects the Company’s earnings to a broader variety of risks and uncertainties. Other businesses in addition to banking that the Company operates include investment banking, securities underwriting and market making, loan syndications, investment management and advice, and retail and wholesale brokerage services offered through the Company’s subsidiaries. These businesses entail significant market, operational, credit, compliance, technology, legal, and other risks that could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.\n36 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nReputational Risks\nNegative public opinion, whether real or perceived, or our failure to successfully manage it could damage the Company’s reputation and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nTruist’s earnings, capital, and stock price are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. Negative public opinion could result from the Company’s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending, sales, training, quality assurance, client complaint resolution, and other operating practices, incentive compensation design and governance, corporate governance, acquisitions, a data breach of client or teammate information, or the failure of any product or service sold to meet clients’ expectations or applicable regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that the Company’s processes and actions will meet regulatory or other stakeholders’ standards or expectations. Findings from self-identified or regulatory reviews require responsive actions, which may include increased investments in compliance systems and teammates or the payment of fines, penalties, increased regulatory assessments, or client redress and may increase legal or reputational risk exposures. In addition, the public perception that a cyberattack on the Company’s systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage the Company’s reputation with clients and third parties with whom the Company does business. Any cybersecurity breaches, attacks, and other similar incidents, including the compromise of personal information, could significantly harm Truist’s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operation.\nNegative public opinion could also result from heightened and differing stakeholder expectations regarding environmental and social considerations that may affect Truist and clients of Truist. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the real or perceived events discussed above could impact our reputation and business. Negative public opinion could adversely affect the Company’s ability to attract and retain clients and teammates and can result in litigation and regulatory actions. Actual or alleged conduct by one of the Company’s businesses can result in negative public opinion about the Company’s other businesses. Actual or alleged conduct by another financial services company can result in negative public opinion about the financial services industry in general and, as a result, adversely affect Truist.\nOur efforts to identify, measure and monitor reputational risk and communicate, internally and externally, such risks to key stakeholders, may be ineffective, untimely, or otherwise result in adverse effects on the Company.\nTalent Management Risks\nWe could be harmed by an inability to attract, develop, retain, and motivate qualified teammates while effectively managing recruiting and compensation costs amid highly competitive and rapidly changing market conditions.\nThe Company’s success depends, to a large degree, upon the continued services of executive officers and other key teammates who have extensive experience and expertise in the industry, and the Company’s ability to attract, develop, and retain high performing, and well-qualified teammates. The Company faces significant competition in the recruitment of highly motivated teammates who can deliver Truist’s purpose, mission, and values. Changes in teammate preferences for work environments, in particular the desire of teammates to work remotely for many or all of their hours, may impact our ability to attract and retain qualified teammates. The Company’s business or its ability to execute its business strategy and provide high quality service may suffer: due to the loss of key or highly-skilled teammates or a failure to successfully transition key roles; if the Company is unable to recruit, develop, or retain a sufficient number of qualified teammates; or if the costs of teammate compensation or benefits increase substantially. The U.S. banking agencies have jointly issued comprehensive guidance to support incentive compensation policies and practices that do not undermine the safety and soundness of banking organizations by encouraging teammates to take imprudent risks. This guidance significantly affects the amount, form, and context of incentive compensation that may be provided to teammates and could negatively affect Truist’s ability to compete for talent relative to non-banking companies.\nTruist Financial Corporation 37\n\n\nThe Company’s operations rely on its ability, and the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately staffed workforces and on the competence, trustworthiness, health, and safety of teammates.\nTruist’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence, integrity, health, and safety of its teammates. Truist is similarly dependent on the workforces of other parties on which its operations rely, including vendors and other service providers. Truist’s businesses could be adversely affected by the ineffective implementation of business decisions; any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train teammates with respect to those risks and controls; or staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets. Changes in law or regulation in jurisdictions in which our operations are located that affect teammates may also adversely affect our ability to hire, develop, and retain qualified teammates in those jurisdictions. In addition, the Company’s business could be adversely impacted by a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud, or other unlawful conduct, or other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by a teammate of Truist or a teammate of another party on which Truist’s operations depend. Truist’s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to support the health and safety of its teammates are ineffective, or if any external party on which Truist relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its teammates.\nRisks Related to Estimates and Assumptions\nOur business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed.\nTruist relies on models to measure risks, estimate certain financial values, and inform certain business decisions. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.\nPoorly designed, implemented, or incorrectly used models present the risk that certain Truist business decisions may be adversely affected by inappropriate model output. In addition, models based on historical data may degrade over time due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements, or client behavior and liquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic events). Also, information Truist provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or incorrectly used models could be inaccurate or misleading. Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to Truist’s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the perception of insufficient model quality or incorrect model use.\nWe use estimates and assumptions in determining the value or amount of many of our assets and liabilities, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected if these prove to be incorrect.\nAccounting policies and processes are fundamental to how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the Company’s assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of the Company’s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect or are adjusted periodically, the Company may experience material losses.\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments, and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the realization of income and expense or the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Company’s financial statements. Truist has established policies and procedures that are intended to provide for these critical accounting estimates and judgments to be well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to establish a process for changing methodologies in an appropriate manner. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the Company’s judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, the Company cannot guarantee that adjustments to accounting policies or restatement of prior period financial statements will not be required.\nFurther, from time to time, the FASB and SEC adopt new accounting standards or change existing financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s financial statements. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond the Company’s control, can be hard to predict and could materially affect how the Company reports its financial results and condition. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\n38 Truist Financial Corporation\n\n\nDepressed market values for the Company’s stock and adverse economic conditions sustained over a period of time may require the Company to write down all or some portion of the Company’s goodwill.\nGoodwill is periodically tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is greater than the carrying amount, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. The fair value of a reporting unit is impacted by the reporting unit’s expected financial performance and susceptibility to adverse economic, regulatory, and legislative changes. Based on the Company’s annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 1, 2023, the Company incurred a $6.1 billion non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2023 based on the carrying values of certain reporting units being in excess of their respective fair values. Future adverse changes in economic conditions or expected financial performance, a sustained decrease in Truist’s stock price, a decline in industry peer multiples, an increase in the applicable discount rate, or a deterioration in a reporting unit’s forecast may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to be below its carrying amount, resulting in an additional goodwill impairment charge. The estimated fair values of the individual reporting units are assessed for reasonableness by reviewing a variety of indicators, including comparing these estimated fair values to the Company’s market capitalization over a reasonable period of time. While this comparison provides some relative market information about the estimated fair value of the reporting units, it is not determinative and needs to be evaluated in the context of the current economic environment. However, significant and sustained declines in the Company’s market capitalization could be an indication of potential goodwill impairment. Refer to the “Critical Accounting Policies” section for additional details related to the Company’s intangible assets and goodwill.\nOperational Risks\nTruist relies extensively on third parties to provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure, and their failure to perform to our standards or our failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships could adversely affect us.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure and while we have implemented a supplier risk management program, we do not control third-party service providers, their actions, or their businesses. No assurance can be provided that third-party service providers will perform to our standards, adequately represent our brand, comply with applicable law, appropriately manage their own risks, including cybersecurity, remain financially or operationally viable, abide by their contractual obligations, or continue to provide us with the services that we require.\nOur use of third-party service providers exposes us to the risk that such third parties may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties. We may need to incur substantial expenses to address risks or issues with a service provider, and if such risks or issues cannot be acceptably resolved, we may not be able to timely or effectively replace the service provider due to contractual restrictions, the unavailability of acceptable alternative providers, or other reasons. In addition, a failure to appropriately assess and manage our relationships with third parties, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services, or other critical activities, could adversely affect Truist by resulting in potential harm to clients, and any liability associated with that harm; supervisory actions, regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions; lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues; increased operational costs; or harm to Truist’s reputation.\nThe Company is not insured against all types of losses as a result of third-party-related failures, and the insurance coverage that does exist may be inadequate to protect the Company from all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company’s business infrastructure could interrupt its operations or increase the costs of doing business.\nThe Company’s risk management framework may fail to identify and manage the risks that we face.\nTruist has policies, processes, and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which the Company is subject, including liquidity, credit, market, operational, technology, reputational, strategic, and compliance risk, among others. Notwithstanding such risk management framework, however, we cannot guarantee that we adequately or effectively identify and manage the risks in our business and operations currently, or that we will adequately or effectively identify and manage such risks in the future. For example, some of the Company’s methods of identifying and managing risk are based upon the Company’s use of observed historical market behavior and management’s judgment. These methods may not accurately predict future exposures, which could be significantly greater than historical measures indicate. Moreover, as the risks that we face continue to evolve, despite our ongoing efforts to improve the design and implementation of our risk-management framework, those efforts may not be adequate or effective. If the Company’s risk management framework fails to identify and manage the risks that we face, we could suffer unexpected losses and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nTruist Financial Corporation 39\n\n\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, Truist depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties, and Truist could be negatively impacted if the information is not accurate or complete.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, Truist relies on the completeness and accuracy of representations made by and information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. If the information provided is not accurate or complete, the Company’s decisions about extending credit or entering into other transactions with clients or counterparties could be adversely affected, and the Company could suffer defaults, credit losses, or other negative consequences as a result.\nTruist can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services, and delivery platforms.\nWhen Truist launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or invests in a business or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish Truist’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in potential liability to clients and counterparties, and result in increased operating expenses. The Company could also experience higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions, reputational damage, impairment of Truist’s liquidity, regulatory intervention, or weaker competitive standing. Any of the foregoing consequences could adversely affect Truist’s businesses and results of operations.\n40 Truist Financial Corporation",
