      "text": "ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.\nWe are a leading creator and manufacturer of food, beverage, health & biosciences, scent and pharma solutions and complementary adjacent products, including natural health ingredients, which are used in a wide variety of consumer products. Our products are sold principally to manufacturers of dairy, meat, beverages, snacks, savory, sweet, baked goods, grain processors and other foods, personal care products, soaps and detergents, cleaning products, perfumes, dietary supplements, food protection, infant, elderly and animal nutrition, functional food, pharmaceutical and oral care products. As a result, we hold global leadership positions in the Food & Beverage, Home & Personal Care and Health & Wellness markets, and across key Tastes, Textures, Scents, Nutrition, Enzymes, Cultures, Soy Proteins, Pharmaceutical Excipients and Probiotics categories.\nSales in 2024 were $11.484 billion. Our business is geographically diverse, with sales in the U.S. representing approximately 28% of sales in 2024. No other country represented more than 10% of sales. In 2024, no customer accounted for 10% or more of sales.\nOur Product Offerings\nAs of December 31, 2024, our business consisted of four segments: Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions.\nNourish\nAs a leading creator of ingredients and solutions, we help our customers deliver on the promise of healthy and delicious foods and drinks that appeal to consumers. We create products in our regional creative centers which allows us to satisfy local customer preferences, while also helping to ensure regulatory compliance and production standards. We develop thousands of different Nourish offerings, most of which are tailor-made, and we continually develop new ingredients and solutions to meet changing consumer preferences and customer needs.\nOur Nourish segment consists of an innovative and broad portfolio of natural-based ingredients to enhance nutritional value, texture and functionality in a wide range of beverage, dairy, bakery, confectionery and culinary applications and consists of Ingredients and Flavors.\nIngredients include a diversified portfolio across natural and plant-based specialty food ingredients derived from herbs and plants that provide texturizing solutions used in the food industry, food protection solutions used in food and beverage products, as well as specialty soy and pea protein with value-added formulations, emulsifiers and sweeteners. Natural food protection ingredients consist of natural antioxidants and anti-microbials used for natural food preservation and shelf-life extension for beverages, cosmetic and healthcare products, pet food and feed additives. Ingredients also includes savory solutions (such as spices, marinades, mixtures) and inclusion products (such as products combining flavorings with fruit, vegetables and other natural ingredients), formerly part of Food Designs. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we announced our entry into an agreement to sell a portion of the Savory Solutions business and completed the divestiture on May 31, 2023.\nFlavors include a range of flavor compounds and natural taste solutions that are ultimately used by our customers in savory products (soups, sauces, meat, fish, poultry, snacks, etc.), beverages (juice drinks, carbonated or flavored beverages, spirits, etc.), sweets (bakery products, candy, cereal, chewing gum, etc.), and dairy products (yogurt, ice cream, cheese, etc.). Flavors also include value-added spices and seasoning ingredients for meat, food service, convenience, alternative protein and culinary products.\nHealth & Biosciences\nOur Health & Biosciences segment consists of the development and production of an advanced biotechnology-derived portfolio of enzymes, food cultures, probiotics and specialty ingredients for food and non-food applications. Among many other applications, this biotechnology-driven portfolio includes cultures for use in fermented foods such as yogurt, cheese and fermented beverages, probiotic strains, many with documented clinical health claims for use as dietary supplements and through industrial fermentation the production of enzymes and microorganisms that provide product and process performance benefits to household detergents, animal feed, ethanol production and brewing. Health & Biosciences is comprised of Health, Cultures & Food Enzymes, Home & Personal Care, Animal Nutrition and Grain Processing.\nHealth provides ingredients for dietary supplements, functional food and beverage, specialized nutrition and pharma.\nCultures & Food Enzymes provides products that aim to serve the global demand for healthy, natural, clean label and fermented food for fresh dairy, cheese, bakery and brewing products. Such products contribute to extended shelf life, stability, taste and texture, helping our customers to improve their product offerings. The business’s enzyme solutions also allow our customers to provide low sugar, high fiber and lactose-free dairy products.\n 3\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHome & Personal Care produces enzymes for laundry and dishwashing detergents, cleaning and textiles to help enhance the product and process performance of products in the fabric and home care, textiles and industrials and personal care markets. The business also produces patented enzymatic polymers that are renewable, biodegradable alternatives to functional ingredients used in home cleaning and beauty care products.\nAnimal Nutrition produces feed enzymes and animal health solutions that help to improve nutrition, welfare, performance and sustainability of livestock animal farming.\nGrain Processing produces yeasts and enzymes for biofuel production and carbohydrate processing.\nScent\nOur Scent segment creates fragrance compounds and fragrance ingredients that are integral elements in the world’s finest perfumes and best-known household and personal care products. Consumer insights, science and creativity are at the heart of our Scent business, and, along with our unique portfolio of natural and synthetic ingredients, global footprint, innovative technologies and know-how, and customer intimacy, we believe make us a market leader in scent products. The Scent segment is comprised of Fragrance Compounds and Fragrance Ingredients. We completed the divestiture of our Cosmetic Ingredients business, previously within the Scent segment, on April 2, 2024.\nFragrance Compounds are unique and proprietary combinations of multiple fragrance ingredients that are ultimately used by our customers in their consumer goods. Our creative and commercial teams within fragrance compounds are organized into two broad categories: fine fragrances and consumer fragrances.\nOur perfumers harness creativity and leverage our innovative captive molecules, sustainable natural ingredients obtained with innovative processes, biotech ingredients, data science, and consumer insights to create unique and inspiring fragrances driving consumer preferences.\nOur fine fragrances focus on perfumes and colognes, creating global and local namesake brands, from high luxury to mass market, from market leading to ultra-niche products.\nOur consumer fragrances include three end-use categories of products:\n•Fabric Care, including laundry detergents, fabric softeners and specialty laundry products;\n•Home Care, including household cleaners, dishwashing detergents and air fresheners; and\n•Body Care, including personal wash, hair care and toiletries products.\nFragrance Ingredients are natural and synthetic, and active and functional ingredients that are used internally and sold to third parties, including competitors, for use in the preparation of compounds. While the principal role of our fragrance ingredients facilities is to support our fragrance compounds business, we utilize excess manufacturing capacity to manufacture and sell certain fragrance ingredients to third parties, enabling us to leverage our fixed costs while maintaining the security of our supply for our perfumers and ultimately our customers. We completed the divestiture of our Flavor Specialty Ingredients business on August 1, 2023. The Flavor Specialty Ingredients business previously comprised of natural flavor extracts, specialty botanical extracts, distillates, essential oils, citrus products, aroma chemicals and natural gums and resins, which are used for food, beverage and flavors, and are often sold directly to food and beverage manufacturers who use them in producing consumer products.\nPharma Solutions\nOur Pharma Solutions segment produces, among other things, a vast portfolio of cellulosics and seaweed-based pharmaceutical excipients, used to improve the functionality and delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including controlled or modified drug release formulations, and enabling the development of more effective pharmaceutical finished dosage formulations. Our excipients are used in prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. Our Pharma Solutions products also serve a variety of other specialty and industrial end-uses including coatings, inks, electronics, agriculture and consumer products. During March 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell the Pharma Solutions business disposal group, that is primarily made up of most businesses within the Company’s existing Pharma Solutions reportable segment as well as certain adjacent businesses. During October 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its nitrocellulose business, which is within the Company’s existing Pharma Solutions reportable operating segment. Both transactions are expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.\nOrganization in 2025\nAs previously announced in 2024, starting January 1, 2025, our Nourish segment has been separated into two newly named business units, Taste and Food Ingredients. With small additional adjustments, our Flavors business, formerly part of Nourish, has been renamed Taste, and our Ingredients business, formerly part of Nourish, has been renamed Food Ingredients. Thus, \n 4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nstarting in the first quarter of 2025, our business segments will consist of Taste, Food Ingredients, Health & Biosciences, Scent, and, until the completion of the sale of the Pharma Solutions business disposal group, Pharma Solutions.\nConsumer Insights, Research and Product Development Process\nThe markets in which we compete require constant innovation to remain competitive. Consumer preferences tend to drive change in our markets, and as science evolves and sustainability continues to be a key factor to customers and consumers, we must continue to strengthen our research and development platforms and adapt our capabilities to provide differentiated products.\nConsumer Insights\nWe believe that the first step to creating an innovative and unique product experience begins with gaining insight into the consumer and emerging industry trends. By developing a deep understanding of what consumers value and prefer through our consumer insight programs, we are better able to focus our research and development and creative efforts.\nOur consumer science, insight and marketing teams interpret trends, monitor product launches, analyze quantitative market data and conduct numerous consumer interviews annually.\nBased on this information, we develop innovative and proprietary programs to evaluate potential products that enable us to understand the emotional connections between a prospective product and the consumer. We believe this ability to pinpoint the likelihood of a product’s success translates into stronger brand equity, resulting in increased returns and greater market share gains for our customers as well as for IFF.\nResearch and Development\nWe consider our research and development infrastructure to be one of our key competencies and critical to our ability to provide differentiated products to our customers. We have strong product and application development pipelines built upon a global network that includes research and development, as well as regulatory and product stewardship capabilities.\nWe focus and invest substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative molecules, compounds, formulations and technologies and the application of these to our customers’ products. Using the knowledge gained from our consumer insights programs and business unit needs, we strategically focus our resources around key research and development platforms that address or anticipate consumer needs or preferences. Our innovation-based platforms are aligned with key consumer insight-led growth themes: improving home and personal care, empowering wellbeing and healthy lives, transforming food systems and accelerating climate solutions. By aligning our capabilities and resources to these platforms, we ensure the proper support and focus for each program so that our products can be further developed and eventually accepted for commercial application.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have 894 granted U.S. patents, and 458 pending U.S. patent applications, as well as thousands of other granted patents and pending patent applications around the world. We have developed many unique molecules and delivery systems for our customers that are used as the foundations of successful products around the world.\nOur principal basic research and development activities are located in Union Beach, New Jersey; Wilmington, Delaware; Palo Alto, California; Brabrand, Denmark; and Leiden, The Netherlands. At those locations, our scientists and application engineers, while collaborating with our other research and development centers around the world, support the:\n•discovery of new materials;\n•development of new technologies, such as delivery systems;\n•creation of new compounds; and\n•enhancement of existing ingredients and compounds.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 3,400 people globally in research and development activities (including innovation, creation and design activities).\nCreative Application\nThrough our global network of creative centers and application laboratories, we create or adapt the basic Nourish, Health & Biosciences, Scent and Pharma Solutions products that we have developed in the research and development process to commercialize for use in our customers’ consumer products. Our global creative teams consist of marketing, consumer science, consumer insights and technical application experts, from a wide range of cultures and nationalities. In close partnership with our customers’ product development groups, our creative teams create the experiences that our customers are seeking in order to satisfy consumer demands in each of their respective markets.\nNew product development is driven by a variety of sources including requests from our customers, who are in need of specific products for use in a new or modified consumer product, or as a result of internal initiatives stemming from our \n 5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nconsumer insights program. Our product development team works in partnership with our scientists and researchers to optimize the consumer appeal and relevance of our offerings. We use a collaborative process between our researchers, our product development team and our customers to perfect our offerings so they are ready to be included in the final consumer product.\nIn addition to creating new products, our researchers and product development teams advise customers on ways to improve their existing products by moderating or substituting current ingredients with more readily accessible or less expensive materials enhancing their yield, or helping to increase or improve functionality of their formulations. This often results in creating a better value proposition for our customers.\nMost of our formulas are treated as trade secrets and remain our proprietary assets. Our business is not materially dependent upon any individual patent, trademark or license.\nSupply Chain\nWe strive to provide our customers with consistent and quality products on a timely and cost-effective basis by managing all aspects of the supply chain, from raw material sourcing through manufacturing, quality assurance, regulatory compliance and distribution.\nProcurement\nIn connection with the manufacture of our products, we use natural and synthetic ingredients. As of December 31, 2024, we purchased approximately 20,000 different raw materials sourced from an extensive network of domestic and international suppliers and distributors.\nNatural ingredients are derived from flowers, fruits and other botanical products, as well as from plant, animal and marine products, and commodity crops like wheat, corn and soy. They contain varying numbers of organic chemicals that are responsible for the fragrance, flavor, antioxidant properties and nutrition of the natural products. Natural products are purchased directly from farms or in processed and semi-processed forms. Some natural products are used in compounds in the state in which they are obtained and others are used after further processing. Natural products, together with various chemicals, are also used as raw materials for the manufacture of synthetic ingredients by chemical processes.\nIn order to ensure our supply of raw materials, achieve favorable pricing and provide timely transparency regarding inflationary trends to our customers, we continue to focus on:\n•purchasing under contract with fixed or formula-based pricing for set time periods;\n•entering into hedging for raw materials we purchase that can be hedged against liquid commodity assets;\n•entering into supplier relationships to gain access to supplies we would not otherwise have;\n•implementing indexed pricing;\n•reducing the complexity of our formulations;\n•evaluating the profitability of whether to buy or make an ingredient;\n•sourcing from local countries with our own procurement professionals; and\n•periodically assessing our supply base with a view towards greater cost efficiencies and improvements.\nManufacturing and Distribution\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 150 manufacturing facilities, creative centers and application laboratories located in approximately 40 different countries. Our major manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, The Netherlands, Spain, Germany, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, Slovenia, China, India, Ireland, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Belgium and Singapore.\nOur supply chain initiatives are focused on increasing capacity and investing in key technologies. Within our more mature markets, we tend to focus on consolidation and cost optimization as well as the implementation of new technologies. In addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we develop relationships with third parties, including contract manufacturing organizations, that expand our access to the technologies, capabilities and capacity that we need to better serve our customers.\nFor more detailed information about risks related to our supply chain, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” – “Supply chain disruptions, geopolitical developments, climate-change events, natural disasters, public health crises, tariffs and trade wars, and other events may adversely affect our business, our procurement of raw materials, and our development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products, and thus may impact our productivity, business and financial results.”\nSustainability \nIn 2021, we launched a refreshed and comprehensive sustainability roadmap, the ‘Do More Good Plan’ (“the Plan”), which aligns with IFF’s strategy for long-term growth and value creation. Supported by a set of ambitious 2030 goals, the Plan \n 6\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncomprises four interconnected pillars that capture the areas where we believe we can have the greatest positive impact: Sustainable Solutions, Climate & Planetary Health, Equity & Wellbeing, Transparency & Accountability.\nSustainable Solutions\nWe deliver solutions that seek to transform industries and empower our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives, beginning with our commitment to responsible sourcing and then leveraging our research and development program to drive environmentally and socially-conscious innovation. \nClimate & Planetary Health\nOur science-based approach to environmental sustainability across our own operations includes investing in energy-efficient systems and expanding our use of renewable energy as we work to achieve our ambition for net zero greenhouse gas emissions. We partner across our value chain to reduce our footprint by advancing our climate action strategies, reducing our water use and striving for zero waste to landfill. \nEquity & Wellbeing\nWe are advancing our commitment to people and communities by ensuring an equitable and inclusive environment for all employees, while continuously improving our safety program by striving for an injury-free workplace and achieving world-class safety performance.\nTransparency & Accountability\nConducting our business with the highest integrity is essential to fulfilling our Do More Good vision. Our robust and transparent corporate governance framework is designed to ensure compliance with our policies, as well as with laws and regulations. Our employees are expected to act ethically, speak up and seek advice when in doubt, and our leaders are accountable for upholding our values and advancing toward our goals.\nAcross these four pillars, the Company continued to achieve notable recognitions in 2024. For example, we qualified as a constituent of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, North America, for the fifth consecutive year, a best-in-class benchmark for investors who recognize that sustainable business practices are critical to generating long-term shareholder value. This distinction validates IFF’s leadership position in sustainability performance and underscores our commitment to executing on key sustainability priorities. We were also awarded the 2024 EcoVadis Platinum sustainability rating for the fourth consecutive time, placing IFF among the top 1% of companies assessed. In addition, we continue to support transparency and accountability through our submission to CDP Climate Change, Water Security and Forests. IFF continues to be listed in the FTSE4Good Index series as well as being named as one of America’s Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek.\nGovernmental Regulation \nWe develop, produce and market our products in a number of jurisdictions around the world and are subject to federal, regional and local legislation and regulations in various countries. Our products, which among other industries, are intended for use in food, beverage, pharmaceutical and dietary supplements, home and personal care, and feed, are subject to strict quality and regulatory standards and environmental laws and regulations. We in turn are required to meet strict standards which, in recent years, have become increasingly stringent and affect both existing as well as new products. While the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations leads to higher overall capital expenditure, which can be significant in certain periods, we do not currently anticipate any material capital expenditures necessary to comply with such laws and regulations. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations and while the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty, compliance has not had, and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on capital expenditure, earnings or competitive position.\nOur products and operations are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in each of the markets in which we operate. These agencies include (1) the Food and Drug Administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate flavors, pharmaceutical excipients and other ingredients in consumer products, (2) the Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent international agencies that regulate our manufacturing facilities, as well as fragrance products (including encapsulation systems), (3) the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and equivalent international agencies that regulate the working conditions in our manufacturing, research laboratories and creative centers, (4) local and international agencies that regulate trade and customs, (5) the Drug Enforcement Administration and other local or international agencies that regulate controlled chemicals that we use in our operations, (6) the Chemical Registration/Notification authorities that regulate chemicals that we use in, or transport to, the various countries in which we manufacture and/or market our products, and (7) the U.S. Department of Agriculture and equivalent international authorities with respect to, among other things, labeling of consumer products. We have seen an increase in registration and reporting requirements concerning the use of certain chemicals in a number of countries, such as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulations in the European Union, as well as similar regulations in other countries.\n 7\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we are subject to various rules relating to health, work safety and the environment at the local and international levels in the various countries in which we operate. Our manufacturing facilities throughout the world are subject to environmental standards relating to air emissions, sewage discharges, the use of hazardous materials, waste disposal practices and clean-up of existing environmental contamination. In recent years, there has been an increase in the stringency of environmental regulation and enforcement of environmental standards, and the costs of compliance have risen significantly, a trend we expect will continue in the future.\nFor more detailed information about risks related to governmental regulation applicable to the Company, please refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors” – “If we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards, including those regarding product safety, quality, efficacy and environmental impact, we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations.”\nCompetition\nThe markets for our products are part of a larger market that supplies a wide variety of ingredients and compounds used in consumer products. Our products are sold principally to manufacturers of dairy, meat, beverages, snacks, savory, sweet, baked goods, grain processors and other foods, personal care products, soaps and detergents, cleaning products, perfumes, dietary supplements, food protection, infant, elderly and animal nutrition, functional food, pharmaceutical and oral care products.\nThe global market for our products has expanded, primarily as a result of an increase in demand for, and an increase in the variety of, consumer products.\nThe market for our products is highly competitive. Our main competitors consist of (1) other large global companies, such as Givaudan, DSM-Firmenich, Symrise, Kerry, ADM, and Novonesis, (2) mid-sized companies, (3) numerous regional and local manufacturers and (4) consumer product companies who may develop their own competing products.\nWe believe that our ability to create products with the sustainability related attributes customers expect and compete successfully in the various sub-market is based on:\n•our in-depth understanding of consumers,\n•vertical integration,\n•innovation and technological advances from our research and development activities and, as applicable, our scientists,\n•our ability to tailor products to customers’ needs,\n•our ability to manufacture products on a global scale, and\n•broad-based regulatory capabilities.\nIn certain industries, large multi-national customers and, increasingly, mid-sized customers, may limit the number of their suppliers by placing some on “core lists,” giving them priority for development and production of their new or modified products. To compete more successfully, we must make continued investments in customer relationships and tailor our research and development efforts to anticipate customers’ needs, provide effective service and secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists.”\nPrivate label manufacturers, mostly medium-sized, local or small food manufacturers, constitute a growing segment in certain markets where we are active. Over the last decade, with the strengthening of supermarket chains, online platforms and growing consumer price consciousness, consumption of private label products has grown at a faster rate than the brand food industry rate. We believe that new business opportunities will continue to arise from these clients as they are increasing their demand for products that are similar to existing products in the market, distinctive premium products, as well as more innovative products.\nOur People\nThe success of our business is built on our talented employees. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 22,400 employees worldwide, of whom approximately 24% are employed in the United States. Our workforce plans and talent management programs support our employees to best deliver the business strategy and ensure their development and engagement.\nCulture and Values\nOur culture is based on our four corporate values of passion, partnership, persistence and principled, and the expression of these values can be seen and felt throughout our history. Our employees appreciate that they contribute to products that touch and enhance the lives of millions of people around the world. Our robust culture ambassador and colleague community program continues to engage a broad portion of the IFF community in building common identity and shared purpose and strengthen engagement and motivation by providing programming on IFF values and providing recognition of individuals who exemplify them.\n 8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIFF strives to have a culture on inclusion and belonging where all employees can thrive. Our programs focus on inclusive talent processes, employee experiences, and external engagement. In 2024 we continued to be recognized by external parties such as EDGE, DisabilityIN and Workplace Pride, and employee sentiment on inclusion increased to 82% (compared with 80% in 2023).\nLeadership and Development\nOur leadership development efforts empower employees to become forward-looking, inspiring and capable decision-makers, agents of change and great leaders. A full portfolio of proprietary leadership development programs and an overarching talent management system is in place to support growth of leaders and at all levels. To cultivate our employees’ talent and build sustainable long-lasting careers at IFF, we provide tools that enable our employees to envision their career journeys in the form of articulated career “ladders” and “frameworks”. We offer corresponding development opportunities to include specialized courses for employees globally by partnering with leading institutions and universities to help provide the latest training and development offerings at all levels. We also offer to our employees an extensive library of on-demand courses and materials on leadership, management and professional skills development. Those learning resources are integrated into our human capital platform, allowing managers and employees to establish digitalized learning plans that are ultimately captured as a part of their employee profile. Further, those offerings complement our talent acquisition strategy and organized and personalized feedback process, supported by industry-leading assessment tools.\nOccupational Health & Safety\nEmployee safety is one of the cornerstones of our business. Our occupational health and safety management system requires and encourages employees and supervised contractors at sites globally to uphold IFF’s protocols, report any incidents and suggest improvements that improve the safety of work sites. Our safety management system is based on U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards which apply to all of our sites in conjunction with any local regulations. To work toward a safer workplace, we have put in place a set of protocols and programs related to three areas of focus: (a) safety governance (setting and updating comprehensive safety policies and procedures), (b) safety training of employees based on IFF policies and local requirements, and (c) safety culture characterized by awareness and communication.\nAvailability of Reports\nWe make available free of charge on or through the “Investors” link on our website, www.iff.com, all materials that we file electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such materials with, or furnishing them to, the SEC.\nThe SEC maintains an Internet website, www.sec.gov, that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information that we file electronically with the SEC.\nA copy of our By-Laws, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Codes of Conduct, and the charters of the Audit Committee, Human Capital & Compensation Committee, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee and Innovation Committee of the Board of Directors are posted on the “Investors” section of our website, www.iff.com.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 521 West 57th Street, New York, New York 10019 and 200 Powder Mill Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19803.\nExecutive Officers of Registrant\nBelow is a list of the executive officers of the Company and other significant employees who are members of our Executive Leadership Team as of February 28, 2025.\n 9\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nName                                                  Age                                                                Position\nJ.

      "text": "ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS. \nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following summary highlights some of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Changes to management, including turnover of our top executives, and significant shortfalls in recruitment, retention or transition of employees or our management team could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals.\n•If we are unable to successfully market to our expanded and diverse customer base, our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected.\n•Any impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our profitability.\n•Our funding obligations for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\n•If we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards, including those regarding product safety, quality, efficacy and environmental impact, we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations.\n•Defects, quality issues (including product recalls), inadequate disclosure or misuse with respect to the products and capabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\n 12\n\n\nTable of Contents\n•Failure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close, relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels, and expose us to civil or criminal liability, which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\n•We could be adversely affected by violations, by us or our counterparties, of U.S. or foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, applicable sanctions or competition laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or ethical business practices and related laws and regulations.\n•Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\n•Changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results.\n•The N&B Transaction could result in significant tax liability, and we may be obligated to indemnify DuPont for any such tax liability imposed on DuPont.\n•If we fail to comply with data protection laws in the U.S. and abroad, we may be subject to fines, penalties and other costs.\nRisk Factors\nWe routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business. Some of these risks may cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate. Below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business. How we react to material future developments, as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments, could also affect our future results.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could materially adversely affect, among other things, our financial condition, our ability to return capital to our shareholders, needed investments into our business and our credit ratings.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our total debt was $8.977 billion. There may be circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on our debt could adversely affect our cash flows, our operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders. In addition, our existing Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan are also at variable interest rates, exposing us to potentially material interest rate risk at our current level of indebtedness.\nFurthermore, our degree of leverage could adversely affect our future credit ratings. If we are unable to maintain or improve our current investment grade rating or improve our leverage, it could adversely affect our future cost of funding, liquidity and access to capital markets. The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its senior unsecured debt. However, any downgrade in our credit rating may, depending on the extent of such downgrade, negatively impact our ability to raise additional debt capital, our liquidity and capital position, and may increase our cost of borrowing for new capital raises. In addition, our existing Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan have pricing grids that are based on credit rating, such that our cost of borrowing may increase if our public debt rating decreases. The pricing grid rates have increased by 0.125% for the duration that financial covenant relief (as described below) is provided.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan contain various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers, including the requirement for us to maintain, at the end of each fiscal quarter, a maximum ratio of net debt for borrowed money to credit adjusted EBITDA in respect of the previous four fiscal quarters. On September 19, 2023, we entered into further amendments to our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan that extend certain relief with respect to this financial covenant by providing that during the relief period our leverage ratio shall not exceed as of the end of the fiscal quarter (for the period of the four fiscal quarters then ended): (i) 5.25x for any fiscal quarter ending on or before March 31, 2024, (ii) 4.75x for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024, (iii) 4.50x for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024, (iv) 4.25x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before March 31, 2025, (v) 4.00x for any subsequent fiscal quarter ending on or before September 30, 2025 and (vi) 3.75x for the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2025. The financial covenant relief provided in the September 2023 amendments superseded the ratios and step downs set forth in prior amendments to these credit facilities entered into on August 4, 2022 and March 23, 2023.\nDuring the financial covenant relief period, the amendments prohibit us from (i) effecting share repurchases, (ii) declaring and paying dividends in cash on common stock in excess of $0.81 per share per fiscal quarter (for an aggregate amount of $3.24 per fiscal year) and (iii) creating liens to secure debt in excess of the greater of $300 million and 3.65% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets, in each case subject to certain exceptions set forth in the amendments. During the financial covenant relief period, the Term Loan is subject to a mandatory prepayment provision whereby certain asset sale proceeds must be used to pay down amounts outstanding thereunder. See Note 14 for additional information on the amendments to the debt agreements.\n 13\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur current level of leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing, lead to a reduction or suspension of our dividend payments, decrease our flexibility in responding to or preparing for changes in the industry in which we operate and our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic projects or opportunities, including necessary investments into our business or large acquisitions. Our level of indebtedness, as well as a failure to comply with covenants under our debt instruments, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or our ability to return capital to our shareholders and any additional debt modifications, instruments or covenant reliefs may subject us to additional covenants and restrictions.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our strategic transformation, including our portfolio optimization, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a part of our ongoing strategic transformation and our portfolio optimization strategy, we continue to evaluate and work towards divestitures or strategic transactions. For instance, during the second and third quarter of 2024, we completed divestitures of our Cosmetic Ingredients business and our Flavors and Essences UK business, respectively. Additionally, during March 2024 and October 2024, we entered into agreements for the sale of our Pharma Solutions business disposal group and our nitrocellulose business, respectively, which are each expected to close in the second quarter of 2025. Strategic transactions are generally dependent on many factors which we cannot fully control, including, among other things, relevant industry dynamics or macroeconomic conditions, the interest of potential buyers and their ability to finance such transactions (which is also impacted by general economic and financial conditions and market dynamics), the performance of the underlying assets or business, requisite regulatory approvals, and related separation activities. \nImplementing such transactions can be complex, costly and time-consuming and may also result in additional expenses and unanticipated issues, such as competitive responses, employee turnover or impact on our commercial relationships. For instance, divestitures involve separation costs and efforts that may divert management’s and employees’ attention and also result in stranded costs and dis-synergies for the Company. Moreover, divestitures often entail post-closing third-party agreements, such as supply arrangements (including with “take or pay” provisions), product manufacturing, cross-licensing, transitional, or site services agreements (“ancillary agreements”), that may bind the Company for certain periods after closing, during which market or Company conditions may change. Any failure to enter into, complete or potential delays in closing any such transaction, any failure to avoid potential post-closing disputes, any failure to mitigate or manage the associated costs of such transactions, or obtain appropriate terms for ancillary agreements, could result in significant costs, adversely affect the successful implementation of our portfolio optimization strategy as well as our financial condition, including our leverage ratio. Even if such initiatives are implemented successfully, the full benefits may not be realized or may not be realized within the desired timeframe. The failure to meet the challenges involved in implementing our strategic transformation could result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulatory, consumer and economic trends may result in significant costs or adversely affect demand for our products which may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny or uncertainty towards artificial or other ingredients and certain chemical substances in the U.S. or other jurisdictions, may result in significant costs due to, among other things, delays in developing, manufacturing or marketing of new or existing products, potential required changes in business practices, higher compliance costs, or capital expenditures. See, also “—If we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards, including those regarding product safety, quality, efficacy and environmental impact, we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations.” At the same time, changes in consumer trends driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness, as well as the development of new weight management pharmaceutical products such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, may affect consumer behavior. In addition, there has been growing pressure by consumers, non-governmental organizations and, in some cases, governmental agencies for more transparency in product labeling (including related to biotechnology applications, such as gene editing and mapping). Our customers have been taking steps to address these trends, including by voluntarily providing product-specific ingredients disclosure, which may impact consumer behavior. These and other consumer and regulatory trends could affect the types and volumes of our ingredients and compounds that our customers include in their consumer product offerings and, therefore, the demand for our products, which, among other things, can impact our ability to meet certain productivity levels.\nMany of our products are ingredients in a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world. Changes in the global, regional or local economic conditions have, and may in the near future, adversely impact demand for consumer products at a regional or global level. Such parameters include, but are not limited to, increased inflation, unemployment and underemployment, salaries and wage rates stagnation, low growth rates, and impacts of supply disruptions, climate events, or geopolitical developments. See, also “—International economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements, operations and growth.”\nChanges in demand by our customers, including by regulatory, consumer or economic trends, may translate in changed orders by our customers, including reduced quantities or order cancellations. The timing or volumes in our customers’ orders \n 14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nare generally at our customers’ discretion. Customers may cancel, reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these trends in a timely and cost-effective manner, our productivity, results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to legal claims, disputes, investigations and litigation, including the ongoing antitrust and competition investigations and related class action lawsuits.\nFrom time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims, regulatory investigations, shareholder litigation and other litigation, including claims related to intellectual property, product liability, competition and antitrust, personal injury, environmental matters and indirect taxes. For instance, product liability claims may arise due to the fact that we supply products to the food and beverage, functional food, pharma/nutraceutical and personal care industries. Our manufacturing and other facilities may expose us to environmental claims, claims of personal injury (including from alleged exposure to facilities’ emissions), regulatory investigations and potential fines. \nIn addition, and as further described in our consolidated financial statements, we are subject to antitrust and competition investigations in the United States and Europe, as well as class action lawsuits against us and certain of our competitors in the United States and Canada, alleging violations of antitrust laws and related claims. We may face additional civil suits in the United States or elsewhere relating to such alleged conduct. At this time, we are unable to predict or determine the scope, duration, or outcome of these investigations and lawsuits.\nAntitrust and competition enforcement actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and other regulators may result in regulators imposing fines, penalties, or restrictions on a company’s business practices in a manner that may significantly impact its results of operations. Our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable outcomes in these or other pending or future claims, disputes, investigations or litigation. Poor results of operations, liquidity or financial condition-particularly as we work towards implementation of our ongoing strategic transformation and our portfolio optimization strategy-may increase the likelihood of shareholder litigation.\nIn addition, in light of our product offerings into functional food, nutraceuticals, natural antioxidants or pharmaceutical products, we may also be subject to claims of false or deceptive advertising claims relating to the efficacy, health benefits or other performance attributes of such offerings in the U.S., Europe and other foreign jurisdictions in which we offer these types of products. These claims can arise as a result of function claims, health claims, nutrient content claims and other claims that impermissibly suggest such benefits or attributes for certain foods or food components. The cost of defending these claims or our obligations for direct damages and indemnification if we were found liable could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur insurance may not be adequate to protect us from potential material expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. Any of these factors could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nSupply chain disruptions, geopolitical developments, climate-change events, natural disasters, public health crises, tariffs and trade wars, and other events may adversely affect our business, our procurement of raw materials, and our development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products, and thus may impact our productivity, business and financial results.\nWe, directly or indirectly through our suppliers, are subject to risks, inherent in agriculture, development, manufacturing, distribution or sale on a global scale, including natural disasters, global or local health crises, international conflicts, terrorist acts, geopolitical developments, trade wars, industrial accidents, environmental events, climate change events (including severe weather events), strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, political or economic crises (such as uncertainty related to protracted U.S. federal government funding negotiations or inflation), disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites, product quality control, safety and environmental compliance issues, regulatory requirements, as well as other external factors over which neither our suppliers nor we have control. \nWe use many different raw materials for our business, such as essential oils, extracts and concentrates derived from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and other botanicals, animal products, raw fruits, organic chemicals and petroleum-based chemicals, as well as, gelatin, glycols, cellulose products and cellulose processed grains, guar, locust bean gum, organic vegetable oils, peels, saccharides, seaweed, soybeans, and sugars and yeasts. In connection with our manufacturing of our products, we often rely on third-party suppliers for such raw materials. If our suppliers are unable to supply us with sufficient quantities of ingredients and raw materials to meet our needs, we would need to seek alternative sources of such materials (which may result in higher procurement costs) or pursue our own production of such ingredients or direct acquisition of such raw materials. However, for certain of our ingredients and raw materials, we rely on a limited number of suppliers where there are not readily available alternatives. If we are unable to obtain or manufacture alternative sources of such ingredients or raw materials at a similar cost, we may seek to (i) reformulate our products and/or (ii) increase pricing to reflect the higher supply cost. To mitigate our sourcing risk, we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items. However, if we do not accurately estimate the \n 15\n\n\nTable of Contents\namount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials or competitively price our products, our margins could be adversely affected.\nEnvironmental events may affect our facilities, customers or suppliers and the availability, quality and pricing of raw materials. There is growing evidence that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather and precipitation patterns, growing and harvesting conditions (both on land and in the sea), and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters, such as floods, wildfires, droughts and water scarcity. Environmental or climate change events may disrupt our facilities and have a negative impact on, among other things, crop size and quality, supply chain, energy or transportation costs, affecting as a result our manufacturing processes and the availability, quality, and pricing of affected raw materials. Climate related policies and energy production restrictions and pricing, or the lack or failure of such policies and restrictions, may exacerbate such negative impacts.\nAs we source many of our raw materials globally, we are subject to additional risks. Supply chain disruptions, as demonstrated by the disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in increased costs, delays or limited availability related to raw materials, strain on shipping and transportation resources, and higher energy prices, which can negatively impact our margins and operating results. Energy prices (including the price of fuel and alternative energy sources) are in and of themselves subject to significant volatility caused by, among other things, market fluctuations, supply and demand changes, currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, and other world events, as well as geopolitical developments and climate change related conditions discussed above. \nIn addition, the imposition of or changes in customs, tariffs, other trade protection measures (including with respect to China, Canada, Mexico, European Union or other jurisdictions by the U.S.), import or export licensing requirements, and sanctions on trade with certain countries, imposed by the U.S. or other countries as well as related retaliatory actions or ensuing uncertainty related to such trade measures, could adversely affect demand for our products, our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our products to other markets.\nSimilarly, geopolitical developments, such as the US-China relations, escalating tensions between China and Taiwan, the Russia-Ukraine war, the Israel-Hamas war and wider Middle East developments (including disruptions to the Red Sea passage or such conflicts spreading further in the relevant regions), could also impact, among other things, certain raw material, energy and transportation costs, certain of our suppliers, distributors, customers and local markets, global and local macroeconomic conditions, and cause further supply chain disruptions (including by delaying the delivery times of raw materials needed for our business or our products to customers). We maintain operations in both Russia and Ukraine and export products to customers in Russia and Ukraine from operations outside the region. As the Russia-Ukraine war has prolonged, it continues to impact our sourcing of certain raw materials for future years, and we continue to look for alternative suppliers or adjust the types of raw materials used in our products. In response to the events in Ukraine, the Company has limited the production and supply of ingredients in and to Russia and Belarus to only those that meet the essential needs of people, including food, hygiene and medicine, and as a result, our operating performance in Russia remains lower compared to previous years and may not reverse in the near future. The Israel-Hamas war and wider Middle East developments have impacted and may continue to impact our operations in Israel and certain of our customers, local markets and suppliers.\nWhile we operate research and development, manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world, many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our research and development or creative laboratories facilities are uniquely situated to support our research and development efforts while certain of our manufacturing facilities are the sole location where a specific ingredient or product is produced. If our research and development, manufacturing and distribution facilities were disrupted, including due to the risks outlined above, the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial, which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins, operating results and future growth. \nIf we are not able to successfully mitigate such risks, we could experience disruptions in production or increased costs, which may result in decrease in our gross margin or reduced sales, and have a material adverse effect on our productivity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInflationary trends and pricing uncertainty, including in the price of our input costs, such as raw materials, transportation and energy, could adversely affect our business and financial results in the short term and result in uncertainties in the long term.\nInflationary pressure and price uncertainty may continue in 2025. As a result of the broader inflationary environment and supply chain disruptions we have experienced, and may continue to experience, volatility and increases in the price of input costs, such as certain raw materials, transportation and energy costs. We might also suffer from supply disruptions from supplier exits as higher costs may become unaffordable for certain suppliers. In addition, though many central banks have paused monetary policies such as increasing interest rates to counter inflation, rates remain at historical highs and may continue to remain at such levels. These and other monetary policies to counter inflation could negatively affect our borrowing costs and those of our customers and suppliers, as well as exchange rates and other macroeconomic factors.\n 16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to increase the prices of our products to our customers to offset inflationary cost trends, or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, we could fail to meet our cost expectations, and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected. Our ability to price our products competitively to timely reflect higher input costs is critical to maintain and grow our sales. Increases in prices of our products to customers or the impact of the broader inflationary environment on our customers may continue to lead to declines in demand and sales volumes. Further, we may not be able to accurately predict or hedge for price fluctuations of input costs, or predict the volume impact of the price increases in our products, while our competitors may be able to more successfully adjust to such input cost volatility. Increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to rely less on our products, which could have an adverse long-term impact on our results of operations. Increased cost volatility trends may also impact the business and financial situation of our customers or suppliers, which could in turn affect the demand or supply, respectively, by such parties. Future inflationary and deflationary trends are beyond our control, and we may not be able to sufficiently mitigate any impact on our business and financial situation.\nOur performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory and/or working capital balances.\nWe evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life, expected sourcing levels, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our product/sales mix. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success, financial returns and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product/sales mix to meet our customers’ demands, without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels, customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory, which can adversely impact our financial results. Current supply-chain related issues could also lead to raw material shortages and inventory depletion, which may adversely affect our operations. See “—Supply chain disruptions, geopolitical developments, climate-change events, natural disasters, public health crises, trade wars, and other events may adversely affect our productivity, business, our procurement of raw materials, and our development, manufacturing, distribution or sale of our products, and thus may impact our business and financial results.” Additionally, we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage, our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected.\nWe sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under “factoring” agreements, some of which are sponsored by certain customers. Should we choose not to participate, or if these programs were no longer available, it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends.\nOur business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer.\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive. We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multi-national and specialized companies active in flavors, fragrances, enzymes, pharmaceutical excipients, nutrition and specialty ingredients, as well as consumer product companies which may develop their own competing products. For instance, in the flavors industry, we face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings. Some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product sub-segments, while others participate in many of our product sub-segments. In addition, some of our global competitors may have more resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can. Moreover, there has been increased consolidation among our competitors, and such consolidation or partnerships among our competitors may exacerbate these risks.\nAs we continue to enter into adjacent markets, such as functional foods, specialty fine ingredients and nutrition products, we may face greater competition-related risks in these markets than with our other businesses. For example, the specialty fine ingredients market is more price sensitive than the flavors market and is characterized by relatively lower profit margins. Some fine ingredients products are less unique and more replaceable than competitors’ products. There is no assurance that operating margins will remain at current levels, which could substantially impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCompetition in our business is based, among other things, on innovation, product quality, regulatory compliance, pricing, quality of customer service, the support provided by marketing and application groups, and understanding of consumers. It is difficult for us to predict the timing, scale and success of our competitors’ actions in these areas. In particular, the discovery and development of new products, protection of our intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are critical to our ability to effectively compete in our business. Advancement in technologies have also enhanced the ability of our competitors to develop substitutable products. Increased competition by existing or future competitors, including aggressive \n 17\n\n\nTable of Contents\nprice competition, could result in the loss of sales, reduced pricing and margin pressure and could adversely impact our sales and profitability.\nFailing to identify and make capital expenditures to achieve growth opportunities, being unable to make new concepts scalable, or failing to effectively and timely reinvest in our business operations, could result in the loss of competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales is generated from a limited number of large multi-national customers, which are currently under competitive pressures that may affect the demand for our products and profitability. \nDuring 2024, our 25 largest customers, a majority of which were multi-national consumer products companies, collectively accounted for approximately 33% of our sales in the aggregate. Large multi-national customers’ market share, especially in the consumer product industry, continues to be pressured by new smaller companies and specialty players that cater to or are more adept at adjusting to the latest consumer trends, including towards natural products and clean labels, changes in the retail landscape (including e-commerce and consolidation), and increased competition from private labels, which have resulted and may continue to result in decreased demand for our products by such multi-national customers and volume erosion, especially in our Nourish business. Furthermore, consolidations amongst our customers have resulted in larger and more sophisticated customers with greater buying power and additional negotiating strength. If such trends continue, our sales could be adversely impacted if we are not able to replace these sales.\nIn addition, large multi-national customers and increasingly middle market customers continue to utilize “core lists” of suppliers to improve margins and profitability in the flavors and fragrance segments. Typically, these “core list” suppliers are then given priority for new or modified products. These customers are making inclusion on their “core lists” contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable terms, including rebates, which could adversely affect our margins. We must either offer competitive cost-in-use solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on these “core lists” or seek to manage the relationship without being on the “core-list.” If we choose not to pursue “core-list” status due to profitability concerns or if we are unable to obtain “core-list” status, our ability to maintain our share of these customers’ future purchases could be adversely affected and therefore our future results of operations.\nWe may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers’ needs, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers’ needs, and ultimately appeal to consumers. Innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals, such as the development of new molecules, new and expanded delivery systems and other technologies. In 2024, we spent approximately 5.8% of our sales on research and development, and we expect to continue investment in research and development and innovation initiatives. This investment level may vary in the future if available resources to invest in research and development are limited due to our ongoing integration and restructuring efforts or from adverse macroeconomic or supply chain factors. We also may need to devote more resources to enhancing our existing product portfolios. Our research and development investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers’ specifications, are at an acceptable cost and achieve acceptance by the targeted consumer market. Furthermore, there may be significant lag times from the time we incur research and development costs to the time that these research and development costs may result in increased revenue.\nConsequently, even when we “win” a project, our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer, economic and other risks that are outside of our control, including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product, the level of promotional support for the launch, poor performance of our third-party vendors, anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands, or disruptive innovations by competitors.\nA significant data breach or other disruption to our information technology systems could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information or personal data, and adversely impact our reputation, productivity, business or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems, including some managed by third-party providers, to conduct business and to support our business processes, including those relating to product formulas, product development, manufacturing, sales, order and invoice processing, production, distribution, internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory (including SEC), tax or legal requirements, and collecting and storing customer, supplier, employee and other stakeholder information.\nTo address the risks to our information technology systems and the associated costs, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology and information security policies and controls, cybersecurity insurance, cybersecurity governance and compliance, employee/consultant awareness training, table-top exercises, logging and monitoring \n 18\n\n\nTable of Contents\nand routine testing of our information technology systems. We believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against information security breaches/incidents and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks, however, cybersecurity incidents, data breaches and operational disruptions are constantly evolving, becoming more sophisticated, including through the increasing use of AI, and conducted by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, including foreign governments, cyber terrorists, cyber criminals, malicious employees and other insiders and outsiders. Additionally, continued geopolitical turmoil, including the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine, heightened the risk of cyber incidents. We and our third-party providers are subject to the risks posed by such incidents, which can take many forms, including code anomalies, “Acts of God,” data leakage, hardware or software failures, human errors, cyber extortion, password theft or introduction of viruses, malware and ransomware, including through phishing emails.\nA disruption to our information technology systems could result in the loss of confidential business, customer, supplier or employee information, litigation or fines, and may require substantial investigations, repairs or replacements or impact our ability to summarize and report financial results in a timely manner, affecting our productivity or resulting in significant financial, legal and relational costs and potentially harming our reputation and adversely impacting our operations, customer service and results of operations. Additionally, the increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing and AI, may lead to potential loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of personal data and proprietary information that was collected, used, stored, or transferred with respect to our business, and to dissemination or destruction of confidential information, unintentionally or otherwise, stored in our or in our third-party providers’ systems or through use of AI, which may significantly increase our business and information security costs, and expose us to reputational harm, penalties, or legal liability. As we complete integration of systems of prior acquired companies with IFF’s systems and prepare for the announced divestitures, we reduce our risk profile. Additionally, an information security or data breach could require us to devote significant management and financial resources to address the problems created, and, as a result of the private rights of action provided for under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and other laws relating to data protection and privacy in other jurisdictions, in the event of such breaches, additional private litigation against us may result. These types of adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity or availability of company, customer, supplier or employee information are compromised due to a data loss by us or a trusted third party. We or the third parties with which we share information may not discover any such incidents and/or loss of information for a significant period of time after the incident occurs. In addition, our hybrid and remote work arrangements could introduce operational risk, including cybersecurity and IT systems management risks.\n We have experienced threats to our data and our systems and although we have not experienced a material incident to date, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident. Additionally, while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks in place, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the potential use of AI in our own operations and by third-party partners that we may engage with.\nIFF has been increasingly using or considering using AI tools in its operations, research and development and other areas. Many of our third-party partners also utilize or are considering utilizing certain AI tools. IFF may be exposed to risks in cases where IFF utilizes AI in connection with certain business activities now or in the future, in cases where, whether known or unknown to IFF, IFF personnel, use AI for our business or at IFF locations, or in cases where our third-party partners, whether or not known to IFF, use AI in their business activities (which we may not be in a position to control).\nThe use of AI by us, our employees or any of our third-party partners may result in unauthorized disclosure of personal data, proprietary information and trade secrets, commercially sensitive or confidential information of IFF, our employees or our partners. Similarly, we may become, through the use of AI and unbeknownst to us, recipients or users of such information provided by other parties, which may enable, among other things, third parties to claim that we infringed on their intellectual property rights. Such unauthorized disclosures or uses of information can result, among other things, in reputational harm, loss of confidence by our customers or employees, penalties, litigation costs, or legal liability.\nAdditionally, the use of AI may lead to the weakening or loss of intellectual property rights, where AI-generated inventions or creations may not be properly attributed to the rightful inventors, potentially resulting in disputes over intellectual property ownership and inventorship rights. Further, the use of AI to draft patent applications may lead to inaccuracies or omissions in the applications, potentially resulting in weakened patent protection or possible outright rejection based on intellectual property ownership and inventorship.\nAnalyses, results or business processes relying on AI may also be deficient, inaccurate, or biased and we may fail to identify in a timely fashion or at all, if or to the extent that is the case. Furthermore, AI can exacerbate our cybersecurity or IT risks. See “—A significant data breach or other disruption to our information technology systems could disrupt our operations, result in the loss of confidential information or personal data, and adversely impact our reputation, productivity, business or \n 19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nresults of operations.” With new and evolving AI comes a continually changing AI regulatory environment, which may create additional compliance costs and risks. At the same time, AI is already changing and has the potential to further significantly change the way we or our competitors do business by, among other things, accelerating research and development, creating efficiencies, improving supply chain, productivity and other processes, customer experience, talent management and decision-making. Any failure to capitalize on the AI benefits to the same degree or with the same speed as our competitors may put us in a disadvantageous position and render our intellectual property portfolio less valuable.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage these risks, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets, which exposes us to certain risks.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence, sales organization and product offerings in these markets, and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets. In addition to the currency and international risks described below, our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks. Emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly. As a result, a decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy.\nFurther, there is no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or otherwise. In addition, emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights, exchange controls, unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes, subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency. In conducting our business, we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in trade, customs and tax regimes in these markets. If we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe have significant operations outside the U.S., the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future, with the fluctuations being particularly pronounced in certain emerging markets. Changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales, profitability, assets and/or liabilities. Along with other macroeconomic uncertainty we are experiencing such as a highly inflationary global environment and supply chain disruptions discussed elsewhere in these risk factors, we have experienced and continue to expect volatility in global foreign currency exchange rates. Changes to interest rate policy as managed by the Federal Reserve Bank to counter inflationary trends and potential changes in trade policy may further impact such exchange rates. Further volatility or unfavorable movements in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows or liquidity. Although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities, we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nInternational economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our financial statements, operations and growth.\nWe operate on a global basis, with manufacturing and sales facilities in or supply arrangements with companies based in the U.S., Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Greater Asia. During 2024, approximately 72% of our combined net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations. As a result, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by location, include the following:\n•governmental laws, regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic and macroeconomic conditions, such as increases in taxes, austerity measures that may impact consumer spending, monetary policies that may impact inflation rates, employment regulations, currency fluctuations or controls and sustainability of resources;\n•changes in environmental, health and safety permits or regulations, such as regulations related to biodiversity or the continued implementation and evolution of the European Union’s REACH regulations and similar regulations that are \n 20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbeing evaluated and adopted in other markets, or the ban on microplastics recently adopted by the European Commission (“EC”) and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations which may differ significantly across jurisdictions;\n•increased product labeling and ingredient prohibitions in specific markets that may impact consumer preferences, products costs and/or customer acceptance;\n•the imposition of or changes in customs, tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, and sanctions on trade with certain countries, imposed by the U.S. or other countries, which could adversely affect our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our products to other markets;\n•risks and costs arising from our ability to cater to local demand and customer preferences, language and cultural differences;\n•the movement for increased unionization in the U.S. and internationally may lead to labor instability, employee turnover, increased labor costs or production and operation disruptions;\n•changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which we operate, including the risk of expropriation or nationalization, the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that we generate in these countries;\n•risks and costs associated with negative publicity on social media as a result of increased regulatory scrutiny, potential misinformation and/or targeted campaigns;\n•risks and costs associated with complying with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws;\n•risks and costs associated with complying with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, similar U.S. or foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, applicable sanctions or competition laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or ethical business practices and related laws and regulations;\n•risks and costs associated with political and economic instability, bribery and corruption, anti-American sentiment, and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate;\n•difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel;\n•natural disasters, global or local health crisis, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), epidemics or international conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Hamas war) or geopolitical tension (such as deteriorating U.S.-China relations), including trade wars, terrorist acts, political crisis, national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which we operate, which could endanger our personnel, interrupt our operations or adversely affect the demand for our products, the results of certain regions or our global supply chain; or\n•the risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to increasing customer, consumer, shareholder and regulatory focus on sustainability, which may result in additional costs in order to meet new requirements, including adversely affecting our stock price, results of operations and access to capital.\nOur customers, consumers and shareholders are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental-related and other long-term sustainability issues. At the same time, we face increasing regulatory reporting requirements related to sustainability topics.\nThe increased focus on sustainability has resulted and may continue to result in new and changing regulations, including the need to comply with different regulatory regimes in different jurisdictions, and customer requirements that could affect us. These could cause us to incur additional capital expenditure and other costs or to make changes to our operations or reporting systems in order to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements. We could also lose revenue, including as a result of negative publicity, if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements. Increased regulatory scrutiny, consumer or customer legal actions, shareholder activism with respect to sustainability, shifting public and investor sentiment on environmental, social and governance matters could also lead to increased costs and disruption to operations. These potential costs, changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to successfully enter into or close collaborations, joint ventures, partnerships, acquisitions, or divestitures, or successfully manage such transactions, it could adversely affect our business and growth opportunities.\n 21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, we evaluate and enter into collaborations, joint ventures or partnerships to enhance our research and development efforts, expand our product portfolios and technology, or modify or enter into new distribution arrangements. The process of establishing and maintaining such relationships is difficult and time-consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be able to successfully negotiate such arrangements, the terms of the arrangements may not be as favorable as anticipated, or such arrangements may result in commercial or legal disputes post-closing. Furthermore, our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners’ abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements and these collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner, or at all. In addition, from time to time, we have acquired, and we may acquire, only a majority or partial interest in companies and provided or may provide earnouts for the former owners along with the ability, at our option, or obligation, at the former owners’ option, to purchase the minority interests at a future date at an established price. These investments may have additional risks and may not be as efficient as other operations as we may have fiduciary or contractual obligations to the minority investors and may rely on former owners for the continuing operation of the acquired business. If we are unable to successfully establish and manage these collaborative relationships and investments, it could adversely affect our future growth.\nIn addition, from time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates and conduct acquisitions that may strategically fit our business, our growth or productivity objectives. If we are unable to successfully identify and acquire such candidates or integrate and develop acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings, productivity gains, including any expected increase in revenues and operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquisition target may fail to further the Company’s business strategy as anticipated, and expose the Company to additional liabilities associated with the acquired business, technology or other asset or arrangement. Conducting acquisitions also creates additional risks, including the potential of incremental liabilities or failing to adequately mitigate or address risks in an acquisition agreement, or potential other post-closing disputes. We may also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions if we fail to maintain and integrate the acquired businesses and such impairments charges would reduce our earnings.\nLikewise, from time to time, we conduct divestiture transactions relating to certain of our businesses or assets. In conducting such transactions, we enter into a process and execute agreements which could create incremental liabilities and exposures relating to the divested businesses or assets, as well as risks associated with enforcing such agreements. See, also “—If we are unable to successfully execute our strategic transformation, including our portfolio optimization, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.”\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to certain considerations.\nDividends are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including:\n•cash available for dividends;\n•our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations;\n•our financial condition, including our current or forecasted future cash flows provided by our operating activities (after deducting anticipated future capital expenditures and other commitments required to carry out our operations and business strategy);\n•our operating expenses;\n•restrictions in our credit agreement related to the issuance of dividends, including minimum capital requirements; and\n•other general and economic conditions or other factors our Board of Directors deems to be relevant.\nWe expect to continue to pay dividends to our shareholders; however, our Board may reduce, suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. The Company announced in February 2024 that it had updated its dividend policy, reducing the expected quarterly dividend approximately 50% to enable faster deleveraging of the balance sheet and provide improved financial flexibility.\nAny reduction in the amount of dividends we pay to shareholders could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business and our management team. Changes to management, including turnover of our top executives, and significant shortfalls in recruitment, retention or transition of employees or our management team could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals.\nAttracting, developing, and retaining talented employees is essential to the successful delivery of our products and has become more difficult and costly in the current labor market. Furthermore, as we continue to focus on innovation, our need for scientists and other professionals will increase and may result in increased labor costs. The ability to attract and retain talented \n 22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nemployees is critical in, among other things, meeting productivity goals as well as the development of new products and technologies, which is an integral component of our growth strategy.\nCompetition for employees can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and reward our employees, we may not be able to retain them. If we are unable to retain our employees or attract new employees in the future, our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected. Changing worker and talent market expectations around flexible work models and relocation has also impacted our ability to retain talent.\nIn addition, the loss of any member of our senior management could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy. We may not find an adequate replacement in a timely fashion, or at all and any replacement may view the business differently than current members of management. Future executives may make changes to our strategic focus, operations, business plans or financial guidance and outlook, with corresponding changes in how we report our results of operations. We can make no assurances that we would be able to properly manage any shift in focus or that any changes to our business would ultimately prove successful.\nIf we are unable to successfully market to our expanded and diverse customer base, our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Frutarom and the N&B Transaction, the number of our customers significantly increased and became more diverse. Our historical customer base was primarily comprised of large and medium-sized food, beverage and consumer products companies. With the completion of the N&B Transaction, our customer base has further increased significantly and, based on 2024 sales, we had approximately 18,300 customers, approximately 67% of which are small and mid-sized companies. This substantial increase in and diversity of our customer base has required us and may continue to require us to adjust, among other things, our product development, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, customer relationship and sales strategy as well as adapt corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures to support different go-to-market models. We may experience difficulty managing the growth of a portfolio of customers that is more diverse in terms of its geographical presence as well as with respect to the types of services they require and the infrastructure required to deliver our products. If we are unable to successfully gain market share or maintain our relationships with these customers, our future growth could be adversely affected.\nAny impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our profitability.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of long-lived assets, including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities, and intangible assets, including goodwill and customer relationships.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, including the acquisition of Frutarom and the N&B Transaction, as of December 31, 2024, we recorded approximately $15.525 billion of intangible assets and goodwill, including $4.289 billion of goodwill associated with the acquisition of Frutarom and $11.817 billion of goodwill associated with the merger with the N&B Business, prior to the impact of impairment charges and business divestitures. Our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets or goodwill occur.\nAt least annually, we assess goodwill for impairment. We test for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we record an impairment charge based on the difference between the two. Intangible assets with finite lives are also tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such events and changes in circumstances could include a sustained decrease in our market capitalization, increased competition or unexpected loss of market share, increased input costs beyond projections (for example due to regulatory or industry changes), our inability to recognize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, unexpected business disruptions (for example due to a natural disaster, public health crises, such as pandemics or epidemics or loss of a customer, supplier, or other significant business relationship), acts by governments and courts, operating results falling short of projections, or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $64 million in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Loss. Refer to Part II, Item 7 and Note 1 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates and market factors. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our business performance, future plans, future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates and growth rates based on industry, economic, regulatory conditions and other market factors. Moreover, management will make significant accounting judgments and estimates for the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP, and the underlying valuation models. IFF’s business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if IFF’s accounting judgments and estimates related to these models prove to be inaccurate.\n 23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTo the extent any of our acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Frutarom and the N&B Business, do not perform as anticipated and our underlying assumptions and estimates related to their fair value determination are not met, whether due to internal or external factors, the value of goodwill and other long-lived assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges.\nEffective January 1, 2025, our Nourish segment has been restructured into two newly designated operating segments: Taste and Food Ingredients. This change in management reporting necessitates the reallocation of goodwill between the two reporting units and the performance of a goodwill impairment test both prior to and subsequent to the change. While we have not yet completed our goodwill and long-lived assets impairment assessments required by this internal reporting structure, we anticipate incurring a material impairment charge in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, estimated to be in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion.\nOur funding obligations for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nThe funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations, we could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity.\nAssumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors. In the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, or expected health care costs, our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Considerations\nIf we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards, including those regarding product safety, quality, efficacy and environmental impact, we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed, manufactured and sold. In addition, we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements (including potential site inspections) established by governments, non-governmental organizations, including industry or similar oversight bodies, or contractually by our customers, including requirements concerning product safety, quality and efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management), animal welfare and other sustainability or similar issues. Changes to regulations or the implementation of additional regulations, especially in certain highly regulated markets we are active in, such as regulatory modernization of food safety laws, increased regulatory scrutiny or uncertainty regarding certain ingredients (including synthetic ingredients), and evolving standards and regulations affecting pharmaceutical excipients or in reaction to new or next-generation technologies, including advances in protein engineering, biotechnology (e.g., gene editing and gene mapping), novel uses of existing technologies or stricter rules on ingredients produced by biotechnology techniques have required and may in the future require us to reduce or remove certain ingredients, substances or processing aids from the product portfolio and may result in significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced margins or profitability.\nAs concerns regarding safety, quality and environmental impact become more pressing, we may see new, more restrictive regulations adopted that impact our products in the U.S. and abroad. For example, the EC recently adopted a ban on microplastics, including those found in personal care items, detergents and cosmetics, to reduce plastics pollution. We are now required to modify our products and/or innovate new solutions to replace microplastics in our products. The European Green Deal includes a Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS), which will trigger updates of the main regulations governing chemical substances used in household and cosmetic products or in industrial applications (REACH, CLP, Cosmetic Regulation and Detergent Regulation). This strategy aims for an expansion of the generic risk management approach based on hazard rather than risk and will introduce other concepts like grouping of similar substances to accelerate regulatory decision making. The practical implementation of this strategy may negatively impact some of the products we place on the market, including some enzymes or fragrance ingredients. If we are unable to adapt to these new regulations or standards in a cost effective and timely manner, we may lose business to competitors who are able to provide compliant products, expose ourselves to losses due to paused or ceased operations, customer claims, regulatory fines, litigation or reputational damage.\n 24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGaps in our operational processes or those of our suppliers or distributors can result in products that do not meet our quality control or industry standards or fail to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements, which in turn can result in finished consumer goods that do not comply with applicable standards and requirements. Further, gaps in our operational processes may impact our productivity and also create challenges in recovering damages from our vendors, even when our vendors’ products fail to meet applicable standards and requirements. Products that are mislabeled, contaminated or damaged could result in a regulatory non-compliance event, including fines, penalties or even a product recall by the FDA or a similar foreign agency. \nWe may also be exposed to serious adverse health claims related to undetected poor quality of raw materials, internal system failures to adequately reduce or eliminate certain hazards (such as pathogens, allergens, contaminants, pesticides, physical hazards, etc.) or products that are not in line with required or agreed specifications. Supply chain complexities, aging equipment and infrastructure, human errors, or other failures may exacerbate such risks.\nOur contracts often require us to indemnify our customers for the costs associated with a product non-compliance event, including penalties, costs and settlements arising from litigation, remediation costs or loss of sales. As our offerings are used in many products intended for human use or consumption, these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level. Such a result could lead to potentially large-scale adverse publicity, negative effects on consumer’s health, recalls and potential litigation, fines, penalties, sanctions or other regulatory actions. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties, or if insurance or indemnification is not available, the liability relating to product or possible third-party claims arising from mislabeled, contaminated or damaged products could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, adverse publicity about our products, or our customers’ products that contain our ingredients, including concerns about product safety or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships, as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation.\nDefects, quality issues (including product recalls), inadequate disclosure or misuse with respect to the products and capabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nDefects in, misuse of, quality issues with respect to (including products recalls) or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to our products, as well as performance or other issues in our customer relationships, could lead to lost profits and other economic damage, productivity losses, property damage, personal injury or other liability resulting in third-party claims, criminal liability, significant costs, damage to our reputation and loss of business. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nFailure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close, relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels, and expose us to civil or criminal liability, which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nOur business operations and properties procure, make use of, manufacture, sell, and distribute substances that include known and potentially unknown hazards and are therefore subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment, including air emissions, sewage discharges, the use of hazardous materials, waste disposal practices and clean-up of existing environmental contamination.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us, including the need to pause or cease production, close or relocate one or more of our production facilities, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, fines, sanctions, litigation, costly remediation measures, liability for damages and negative publicity. If we are unable to meet production requirements, we can lose customer orders, which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply. Idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated. If these non-compliance issues reoccur in China or occur or in any other jurisdiction, we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations, close a plant, or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis, and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations, by us or our counterparties, of U.S. or foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, applicable sanctions or competition laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or ethical business practices and related laws and regulations.\nThe global nature of our business, our size and employee count, the significance of our international revenue, our focus on emerging markets and presence in regulated industries create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial \n 25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nadvantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. As such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions, such as China, India, Brazil, Russia and Africa, that pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues. In certain jurisdictions, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. From time to time, we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances, control testing and compliance reviews, and take remedial actions, when appropriate, to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations. \nDetecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the FCPA or other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations is expensive, could consume significant time and attention of our senior management and could subject us to investigations and inquiries by governmental and other regulatory bodies. Any allegations of non-compliance with such laws and regulations could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction, including interruptions of business or loss of third-party relationships, which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with such laws and regulations could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, significant fines, termination of necessary licenses and permits and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation. Given the international scope of our business, we also sell certain of our products to countries that are subject to U.S. and other sanctions under general licenses and authorizations related to such products, technologies and transactions. For example, the U.S., the European Union and other countries have imposed sanctions and export controls on Russia, Belarus and occupied regions of Ukraine. As a result, we have limited our export of ingredients to customers in Russia, Belarus and occupied regions of Ukraine to only those that are permitted and meet the essential needs of people. Compliance with sanctions laws is highly technical and requires careful oversight, and it is possible that actions taken by us, our subsidiaries or our suppliers may cause us to be in breach with these laws, which could have a material adverse effect to our business.\nIn addition, competition laws and regulations continue to be actively enforced by competition authorities in the U.S., the European Union and other jurisdictions where IFF is active. Our failure to comply with competition laws and regulations can expose the Company to, among other things, high fines, damage actions, reputation harm, and disruptions to our business, and expose our employees civil or criminal penalties. See, also “—Our results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to legal claims, disputes, investigations and litigation, including the ongoing antitrust and competition investigations and related class action lawsuits.”\nLastly, our reputation and our customers’ willingness to purchase our products depend in part on our compliance by our suppliers, distributors, customers or other counterparties with ethical employment practices, such as with respect to child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, safe and healthy working conditions, as well as with all legal and regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of their businesses (including the ones mentioned in the preceding paragraphs). While we generally require that third parties we work with agree to our vendor code of conduct, we do not exercise control over our suppliers, distributors, vendors and customers and due to the global nature of our business cannot guarantee their compliance with such ethical and lawful business practices or such legal requirements. If our counterparties fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, safety codes, employment practices, human rights standards, quality standards, environmental standards, production practices, or other obligations, norms, or ethical standards, our reputation and brand image could be harmed, and we could be exposed to litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, monetary liability, and additional costs that would harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights. We often rely on trade secrets to protect our products, manufacturing processes, extract methodologies and other processes, as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property. From time to time, a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights, or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. We could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from third-party assertions of invalidity, infringement, misappropriation or other claims. Any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights. Any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. For those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets, this litigation could result in even higher costs, and potentially the loss of certain rights, since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from \n 26\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmaking, using or selling our products or processes. The ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our products.\nWe vigilantly protect our intellectual property rights, including trade secrets. We have designed and implemented internal controls intended to restrict access to and distribution of our respective intellectual property. Despite these precautions, our intellectual property is vulnerable to unauthorized access through employee error or actions, theft and cybersecurity incidents, and other security breaches, including due to increasing use of AI tools. See, also “—We are subject to risks associated with the potential use of AI in our own operations and by third-party partners that we may engage with.” Protecting intellectual property related to biotechnology is particularly challenging because theft can be difficult to detect and biotechnology can be self-replicating. Accordingly, the impact of such theft can be significant.\nFor intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents, we cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not later be opposed, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the U.S., the laws of some other countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. For instance, we may be unable to obtain or defend intellectual property rights in new and inventive technology developed in whole or in part by relying on AI tools. If other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights, or if our intellectual property rights were the subject of unauthorized access leading to competitive pressure or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights, it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by, among other things, (i) us being required to cease production and marketing or reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights, (ii) increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights, (iii) limiting the volume, if any, of such products that we can sell or (iv) resulting in significant litigation costs and potential liability.\nChanges in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions, cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries. These transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results. Many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction, challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential non-compliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where non-compliance is determined. However, governmental authorities could challenge these policies more aggressively in the future and, if challenged, we may not prevail. We could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies.\nWe are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, state tax authorities and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate, and may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\nIn addition, a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and conducted investigations of the tax practices of multi-national companies and, in the European Union, the tax policies of certain European Union member states. In December 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) released the Pillar Two model rules to reform international corporate taxation that aim to ensure that applicable multinationals (global revenue exceeding €750 million) pay a minimum effective corporate tax rate of 15%. The rules are being passed into national legislation based on each country’s approach, and some countries have already enacted or substantively enacted the rules. A framework on Safe Harbours and Penalty Relief was released in 2022 providing details on the transitional reliefs available to businesses over the initial years of Pillar Two implementation. The OECD released administrative guidance in February 2023 aiming to provide clarity over contentious areas of the model rules and aiming to provide greater certainty for businesses impacted by Pillar Two. We continuously evaluate these developments and the potential impact of the Pillar Two framework, subject to legislative adoption by individual countries. This legislation may have a material effect on our effective tax rate, income tax expense, net income or cash flows.\nThe European Commission (“EC”) is continuously investigating tax rulings in a number of European Union member states, including with respect to specific multi-national corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with European Union rules on state aid. Under European Union law, selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are capable of distorting competition and affecting trade between member states may constitute impermissible state aid. If the EC determines that a tax \n 27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nruling or an implemented tax regime violates the state aid restrictions, the tax authorities of the affected European Union member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling. If the EC, tax authorities or other interested parties in other jurisdictions were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the member states in which we are subject to taxation or our internal intercompany arrangements, we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities or less favorable tax regimes. In addition, a new European Union regulation – the Foreign Subsidy Regulation – has been recently introduced to address distortions in the European Union market caused by foreign subsidies (including favorable tax regimes) granted by non-EU States to companies active in the European Union. The European Union regulation imposes notification requirements, and also empowers the EC to investigate such potential distortions. Should the EC determine that foreign subsidies have been granted to us capable of distorting competition within the EU, the Company may be exposed to penalties and other costs. \nIn August 2022, the U.S. government enacted legislation commonly referred to as the “Inflation Reduction Act”, which, among other things, imposed a minimum “book” tax on certain corporations effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022 and created a new excise tax on stock repurchases made by certain publicly traded corporations after December 31, 2022. We continue to evaluate its impact as further guidance becomes available.\nThe N&B Transaction could result in significant tax liability, and we may be obligated to indemnify DuPont for any such tax liability imposed on DuPont.\nThe completion of the N&B Transaction in 2021 was conditioned upon the receipt by DuPont of an opinion that the transaction generally will qualify as a tax-free reorganization. The tax opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by DuPont, IFF and N&B. If any of those factual representations or assumptions were untrue or incomplete in any material respect, any undertaking was or is not complied with, or the facts upon which the opinion was based are materially different from the facts at the closing of the N&B Transaction, the transaction may not qualify (in whole or part) for tax-free treatment.\nThe N&B spin-off and certain aspects of the pre-spin-off internal reorganizations to form N&B could be taxable to DuPont if N&B or we were to engage in a “Spinco Tainting Act” (as defined in the Tax Matters Agreement, by and among DuPont, N&B and IFF, a form of which is attached to IFF’s registration statement on Form S-4 (Registration Number 333-238072)). A Spinco Tainting Act is generally any action (or inaction) within our control or under the control of N&B or their affiliates, any event involving our common stock or the common stock of N&B or any assets of N&B or its subsidiaries, or any breach by N&B or any of its subsidiaries of any factual representations, assumptions, or undertakings made by it, in each case, that would affect the non-recognition treatment of the spin-off and internal reorganizations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as described above. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we and N&B will be required to indemnify DuPont for any taxes resulting from a Spinco Tainting Act. If we were required to indemnify DuPont pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement as described above, this indemnification obligation may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us, including with respect to our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, we are not indemnified for tax liabilities related to pre-spin-off periods. Tax liabilities could increase as an outcome of final determination of tax examinations and could adversely impact our financial results.\nIf we fail to comply with data protection laws in the U.S. and abroad, we may be subject to fines, penalties and other costs.\nLegal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data continue to evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, restrictions on transfer of personal data, costs and enforcement risks. Many governments have enacted or are enacting new or updated data protection laws, including data localization laws that require personal data to stay within their borders. All of these evolving compliance and operational requirements, restrictions on use of personal data, as well as the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of laws, impose significant costs and regulatory risks that are likely to increase over time. Our failure to comply with these evolving regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, could expose us to litigation claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, investigations, fines, sanctions, penalties and other costs that could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business.",
