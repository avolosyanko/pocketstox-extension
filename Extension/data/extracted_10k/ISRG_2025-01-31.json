      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIn this report, “Intuitive Surgical,” “Intuitive,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. Intuitive®, Intuitive Surgical®, da Vinci®, da Vinci S®, da Vinci Si®, da Vinci X®, da Vinci Xi®, da Vinci 5™, da Vinci SP®, EndoWrist®, Firefly®, Flexision®, Intuitive 3D Models™, Intuitive Hub™, Ion®, My Intuitive™, OnSite®, SimNow®, SureForm®, and SynchroSeal® are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Company.\nCompany Background\nAs part of Intuitive’s mission, we believe that minimally invasive care is life-enhancing care. By combining ingenuity and intelligent technology, we expand the potential of physicians to heal without constraints. We envision a future of care that is less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified early and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most.\nSince our founding 30 years ago, we have been delivering on this mission and vision by combining innovative technology with clinical expertise to advance minimally invasive care. We do so by providing a comprehensive ecosystem that includes robotic-assisted systems, instruments and accessories, customer learning, and support services all connected by a digital portfolio that enables actionable insights across the care continuum. Among other capabilities, these products and services can augment the skills and improve the efficiency of clinicians and care teams while providing decision support and learning that can help deliver differentiated clinical and economic value for patients, providers, and payers when compared to the next best available treatment options.\nTo assure continued alignment with the patients and healthcare community we serve, we have adopted the Quintuple Aim as our “north star.” Starting foremost with a focus on patients, we seek to demonstrate that our products can deliver better outcomes that are validated by rigorous peer-reviewed evidence. Second, we aim to work with clinicians and care teams to create better patient experiences that enable patients to more quickly get back to what matters most in their lives, with fewer complications, less pain and discomfort, and greater predictability. Third, we aim to enable the care teams who use our platforms and technology-enabled ecosystem to have better experiences that augment their skills while reducing fatigue and increasing efficiency and reliability. Fourth, we aim to help lower the total cost of care per patient episode when compared with existing treatment alternatives, providing a return on investment for hospitals and healthcare systems and value for payers. Lastly, we aim to expand access to high-quality minimally invasive care by partnering with hospitals, healthcare systems, and patient advocacy groups to address barriers to care.\nWhile surgery and acute interventions have improved significantly in the past few decades, there remains a significant need to improve across all aspects of the Quintuple Aim. Stakeholders continue to expect better clinical outcomes and decreased variability of outcomes across clinicians and care teams. Globally, healthcare systems continue to be stressed and lacking in critical resources, including the professionals who staff care teams. At the same time, healthcare providers, payers, and governments strain to cover the healthcare needs of their populations and demand lower total cost per patient to treat disease. In the face of these challenges, we continue to believe that we are well-positioned to synthesize scientific and technological advances in biology, computing, imaging, algorithms, and robotics to deliver meaningful and measurable value to all of our stakeholders.\nProducts\nSystems\nAdvanced robotic systems provide precise, powerful platforms with high-performance vision, extending the care team’s capabilities to enhance minimally invasive care. These systems include da Vinci surgical systems, which are designed to enable a wide range of surgical procedures using a minimally invasive approach, and the Ion endoluminal system, which extends our commercial offerings beyond surgery into diagnostic procedures, enabling minimally invasive biopsies in the lung.\nDa Vinci Surgical Systems\nBy striving to find less invasive ways to enter the body, provide clearer views of anatomy and more precise tissue interactions, and help hone surgical skills, Intuitive launched its first da Vinci surgical system in 1999. In 2000, the FDA cleared da Vinci for general laparoscopic surgery. Since then, we have received numerous additional indications within the U.S. as well as outside of the U.S. Refer to the section titled “Regulatory Activities” in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more recent regulatory clearances, approvals, and certification.\nThere are several models of the da Vinci surgical system currently used by our customers: our recently released fifth-generation da Vinci 5 surgical system, our fourth-generation da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci SP surgical systems, our third-generation da Vinci Si surgical system, and our second-generation da Vinci S surgical system. The da Vinci surgical \nTable of Contents\n\nsystems are designed to enable surgeons to perform a wide range of surgical procedures within our targeted general surgery, urologic, gynecologic, cardiothoracic, and head and neck specialties. Da Vinci systems offer surgeons three-dimensional, high definition (“3DHD”) vision, a magnified view, and robotic and computer assistance. They use specialized instrumentation, including a miniaturized surgical camera (endoscope) and wristed instruments (e.g., scissors, scalpels, and forceps) that are designed to help with precise dissection and reconstruction deep inside the body.\nOur da Vinci surgical systems are comprised of the following components:\nSurgeon Console. The da Vinci surgical system allows surgeons to operate while comfortably seated at an ergonomic console viewing a 3DHD image of the surgical field. The surgeon’s fingers grasp instrument controls below the display with the surgeon’s hands naturally positioned relative to his or her eyes. Using electronic hardware, software, algorithms, and mechanics, our technology translates the surgeon’s hand movements into precise and corresponding real-time micro movements of the da Vinci instruments positioned inside the patient. On most of our current systems (da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, da Vinci SP, and da Vinci Si), a second surgeon console may be used in two ways: to provide assistance to the primary surgeon during surgery or to act as an active aid during surgeon-proctor training sessions. With the da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, da Vinci SP, and da Vinci Si, a surgeon sitting at a second console can view the same surgery as the primary surgeon and can be passed control of some or all of the da Vinci instruments during the surgery. In addition, surgeons can control 3D virtual pointers to augment the dual-surgeon experience. The da Vinci surgical system is designed to allow surgeons to operate while seated, which may be clinically advantageous because of reduced surgeon fatigue. The da Vinci surgical system’s design provides natural hand-eye alignment at the surgeon console. Because the da Vinci surgical system’s robotic arms hold the camera and instruments steady, there is less surgeon and assistant fatigue and enhanced control by the surgeon.\nPatient-Side Cart. The patient-side cart holds electromechanical arms that manipulate the instruments inside the patient. For our da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci Si surgical systems, up to four arms attached to the cart can be positioned, as appropriate, and then locked into place. At least two arms hold surgical instruments, one representing the surgeon’s left hand and one representing the surgeon’s right hand. A third arm positions the endoscope, allowing the surgeon to easily move, zoom, and rotate the field of vision. A fourth instrument arm extends surgical capabilities by enabling the surgeon to add a third instrument to perform additional tasks. The fourth instrument arm is a standard, integrated feature on the da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci Si surgical systems. Our da Vinci single-port (“SP”) surgical system includes a single arm with three multi-jointed, wristed instruments and the first da Vinci fully wristed, 3DHD camera. The instruments and the camera all emerge through a single cannula and are triangulated around the target anatomy to avoid external instrument collisions that can occur in narrow surgical workspaces.\n3DHD Vision System. Our vision system includes a 3DHD endoscope with two independent vision channels linked to two separate color monitors through sophisticated image processing electronics and software. The resulting 3DHD image has high resolution, high contrast, low flicker, and low cross fading. A digital zoom feature in the 3DHD vision system allows surgeons to magnify the surgical field of view without adjusting the endoscope position and, thereby, reduces interference between the endoscope and instruments. The 3DHD vision system is a standard, integrated feature on the da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, da Vinci SP, da Vinci Si, and da Vinci S surgical systems.\nFirefly Fluorescence Imaging (“Firefly”). Firefly is a standard feature of the da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci SP surgical systems and is available as an upgrade on our da Vinci Si surgical system. This imaging capability combines an injectable fluorescent dye with a specialized da Vinci camera head, endoscope, and laser-based illuminator to allow surgeons to identify vasculature, tissue perfusion, or biliary ducts in three dimensions beneath tissue surfaces in real-time. The most common procedural categories for the use of Firefly are urology, gynecology, and general surgery.\nDa Vinci Integrated Table Motion. Integrated Table Motion coordinates the movements of the da Vinci robotic arms with an advanced operating room (“OR”) table, the TS 7000dV OR Table sold by Hillrom (now a part of Baxter International Inc.), to enable managing the patient’s position in real-time while the da Vinci robotic arms remain docked. This gives OR teams the capability to improve the positioning of the operating table during da Vinci surgical system procedures. Integrated Table Motion enables the patient to be dynamically positioned during the procedure. It enables surgeons to extend reach, facilitate access, and choose the angle of approach to target anatomy, as well as reposition the table during the procedure to enhance anesthesiologists’ management of the patient. Integrated Table Motion is a standard feature for da Vinci 5 surgical systems and is available as an upgrade for da Vinci Xi surgical systems.\nIon Endoluminal System\nIn 2019, the FDA cleared our Ion endoluminal system, which is a flexible, robotic-assisted, catheter-based platform that utilizes instruments and accessories for which the first cleared indication is minimally invasive biopsies in the lung. Our Ion system extends our commercial offering beyond surgery into diagnostic, endoluminal procedures. The system features an ultra-thin, ultra-maneuverable catheter that can articulate 180 degrees in all directions and allows navigation far into the peripheral \nTable of Contents\n\nlung and provides the stability necessary for precision in a biopsy. Many suspicious lesions found in the lung may be small and difficult to access, which can make diagnosis challenging, and Ion helps physicians obtain tissue samples from deep within the lung, which could help enable earlier diagnosis.\nInstruments and Accessories\nWe offer a comprehensive suite of stapling, energy, and core instrumentation for our multi-port da Vinci surgical systems. Our technology is designed to transform the surgeon’s natural hand movements outside of the body into corresponding micro-movements inside the patient’s body and suture with precision, just as they can in open surgery. With our technology, a surgeon can also use “motion scaling,” a feature that translates, for example, a three-millimeter hand movement outside the patient’s body into a one-millimeter instrument movement in the surgical field inside the patient’s body. Motion scaling is designed to allow precision and control for delicate tasks. In addition, our technology filters the tremor inherent in a surgeon’s hands.\nDa Vinci Instruments. Most of the instruments that we manufacture incorporate wristed joints for natural dexterity and tips customized for various surgical procedures. Various da Vinci instrument tips include forceps, scissors, electrocautery tools, scalpels, and other surgical tools that are familiar to the surgeon from open surgery and conventional minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”). A variety of instruments may be selected and used interchangeably during a surgery. Most instruments are sterilizable at the hospital, while others are provided sterile, and most are reusable for a defined number of procedures. A programmed memory chip inside each instrument performs several functions that help determine how the da Vinci system and instruments work together. In addition, the chip generally will not allow the instrument to be used for more than the prescribed number of procedures to help ensure that its performance meets specifications during each procedure.\nDa Vinci Stapling. The SureForm and EndoWrist staplers are wristed, stapling instruments intended for resection, transection, and creation of anastomoses. These instruments enable surgeons to precisely position and fire the stapler. We have various staplers that can be used with our da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, and da Vinci Xi surgical systems: the SureForm 30, 45, and 60 staplers, where the numeric designation indicates the length of the staple line. The SureForm 30, 45, and 60 staplers are single-use, fully wristed, stapling instruments intended to be used in general, thoracic, gynecologic, urologic, and pediatric surgical procedures. The SureForm 30 stapler may deliver particular utility in thoracic procedures. The SureForm 45 stapler may receive particular use in thoracic and colorectal procedures where maneuverability and visualization are limited. The SureForm 60 stapler is intended to deliver particular value in bariatric procedures. Outside of the U.S. (“OUS”), we also offer the EndoWrist 30 and 45 staplers that can be used with our da Vinci X and da Vinci Xi surgical systems. The EndoWrist 30 stapler is intended to deliver particular utility with fine tissue interaction in lobectomy and other thoracic procedures. The EndoWrist 45 stapler is used in general, gynecologic, thoracic, and urologic surgical procedures. We also have various clearances for five stapler reloads: gray (2.0 mm), white (2.5 mm), blue (3.5 mm), green (4.3 mm), and black (4.6 mm). Not all reloads are available for use on all staplers. Not all staplers or reloads are available in all countries.\nDa Vinci Energy. Our first-generation E-100 generator is offered as an upgrade to power our da Vinci Vessel Sealer Extend and SynchroSeal instruments. Additionally, we recently introduced our second-generation E-200 generator, an advanced electrosurgical generator designed to provide high-frequency energy for cutting, coagulation, and vessel sealing of tissues. The E-200 generator is integrated with the da Vinci 5 surgical system, is compatible with our da Vinci X and Xi surgical systems, and can also function as a standalone electrosurgical generator.\nVessel Sealer Extend is a single-use, fully wristed, advanced bipolar instrument that is compatible with our da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, and da Vinci Xi surgical systems. It is intended for grasping and blunt dissection of tissue, bipolar coagulation, and mechanical transection of vessels up to 7 mm in diameter and tissue bundles that fit in the jaws of the instrument. This instrument enables surgeons to control vessel sealing, while providing the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery, and is designed to enhance surgical efficiency and autonomy in a variety of general and gynecologic surgical procedures.\nSynchroSeal enables a surgeon to perform rapid, one-step sealing and transection with a single pedal press. SynchroSeal uses advanced bipolar energy from its raised cut electrode to transect tissue and then cool down quickly.\nAccessory Products. We sell various accessory products, which are used in conjunction with the da Vinci surgical systems as surgical procedures are performed. Accessory products include sterile drapes used to help ensure a sterile field during surgery, vision products, such as replacement 3D stereo endoscopes, camera heads, and light guides, and other items that facilitate the use of the da Vinci surgical systems.\nInstruments and accessories are also used with our Ion endoluminal system to perform lung biopsy procedures and for the operation and maintenance of the system.\nIon Instruments. Instruments utilized with our Ion system include our fully articulating catheter, which is employed to navigate the intricate and narrow airways of the lungs, our peripheral vision probe, an endoscope that provides real-time \nTable of Contents\n\nairway visualization for catheter navigation, and our Flexision biopsy needles, which are used to procure tissue samples from lung nodules.\nAccessory Products. Accessory products that are used in conjunction with the Ion system include cleaning tools and other ancillary equipment essential for the operation and maintenance of the Ion system.\nLearning\nIntuitive provides a progressive learning journey to support the use of our technology.

The vast majority of our systems are network connected and directly communicate with Intuitive to enable proactive monitoring of product performance to provide high uptime reliability, as well as provide software updates and data insights to Intuitive customers.\n3D Modeling Services. Intuitive 3D Models is our augmented reality imaging product for use in kidney, prostate, lung, and rectal procedures. The service extracts CT and MR scans, runs them through segmentation algorithms and, after technicians’ revision and radiologists’ review, returns a 3D segmented model of the organ for use in planning for a procedure, intraoperative visualization, and surgical education. The tool uses augmented reality to give surgeons an image with details of organ anatomy – blood vessels, tumor shape, and size – that they may not be able to see well with other two-dimensional imaging. Intuitive designed this to help with pre-operative planning and intraoperative guidance to let surgeons know where critical anatomy sits as they work through a procedure, as well as to be shared as a teaching tool for other physicians and patients. The product has recently been launched, and we are in the process of bringing the first sites onboard.\nMy Intuitive. This mobile and web application was developed to be the single point for Intuitive customers to access individual or program-level data from Intuitive. The application also offers comparisons of those insights with anonymized national benchmarks to help drive operational efficiencies and decreased costs. It enables mobile access to Intuitive’s Learning platform, case reports generated automatically for the surgeon, and an ability for surgeons to publish their practice information online for patients seeking local physicians.\nIntuitive Hub. Intuitive Hub is an OR informatics platform that integrates multiple applications and data sets to help orchestrate medical procedure workflows. For the care team, Intuitive Hub acts as a point-of-care device that automates tasks, such as video recording and bookmarking. The Intuitive Telepresence application on Hub can be used to facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration, learning, and support. Video captured during surgery and da Vinci system data are connected via Intuitive Hub for physicians to access after a surgical procedure, helping to facilitate personalized learning and increase efficiency.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe align our goals to those of our customers, often called the Quintuple Aim: enabling physicians and hospitals to improve outcomes for their patients, improve their patient’s experience, improve the care team’s experience, address barriers to expanding access to high quality minimally invasive care, and lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. Through the use of Intuitive’s smart, connected systems, robotic technologies, advanced imaging, and informatics, our objective is to create value for patients, physicians, and hospitals, as summarized below.\nPatient Value. We believe that the value of a medical procedure to a patient can be defined: Patient Value = Procedure Efficacy / Invasiveness. We define procedure efficacy as a measure of the success of the procedure in helping resolve the underlying disease, and invasiveness as a measure of patient pain and disruption of regular activities. When the patient value of a procedure using an Intuitive product is greater than that of alternative intervention options, patients may benefit from seeking out physicians and hospitals that offer those products, which could potentially result in a local market share shift. Adoption of Intuitive technology occurs by procedure and by market and is driven by the relative patient value and the total intervention costs of da Vinci and Ion procedures as compared to alternative intervention options for the same disease state or condition. We believe that most patients will place a higher value on procedures that are not only more efficacious but also less invasive than alternative interventions. Our goal is to provide products to \nTable of Contents\n\nphysicians who, in turn, provide patients with procedure options that are both highly effective and less invasive than others. Furthermore, we will work to increase access to minimally invasive care.\nPhysician Value. We offer physicians and their operating room staff training on the technical use of our products. Our da Vinci surgical system provides an ergonomic platform for surgeons to perform their procedures. We seek to provide surgeons with reliable and easy-to-use products. For example, the change to cloud-based analytics and routine use of local analytics may help surgeons track their procedures and processes and, with a network-connected smartphone and the My Intuitive app, surgeons can access and explore their procedure data, such as console time and instrument usage, to gain insights into their program. Ion brings physicians an immersive bronchoscopy experience from visualizing the lung anatomy and planning each patient’s procedure to navigating and biopsying small nodules in the peripheral lung. Results from early studies have demonstrated relatively low occurrence of pneumothorax requiring intervention.\nHospital Value. We help hospitals build value by increasing surgical revenue and reducing costs through lower complication rates and reduced lengths of patient stay. For example, we believe robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci surgical system is a cost-effective approach to many surgeries as compared to alternative treatment options, as recognized in many published studies. We also offer our Custom Hospital Analytics program, which enables the integration of data sources so that individual health institutions can analyze their data in their own environment. Using this data, administrators, chiefs of surgery, and surgeons can gain alignment around their programs based on their KPIs, determine best practices, assess gaps, and take actionable steps to address any gaps.\nClinical Applications\nWe are the beneficiaries of productive collaborations with leading surgeons in exploring and developing new techniques and applications for robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci surgical system and minimally invasive biopsies with the Ion endoluminal system—an important part of our creative process. We primarily focus our development efforts on those procedures in which we believe our products bring the highest patient value, surgeon value, and hospital value. We currently focus on five surgical specialties: general surgery, urologic surgery, gynecologic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, and head and neck surgery. Key procedures that we are focused on include hernia repair, colon and rectal procedures, cholecystectomy, bariatric surgery, prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy, hysterectomy, sacrocolpopexy, lobectomy, and transoral robotic surgery. We also focus on minimally invasive biopsies in the lung. Representative surgical applications are described below.\nGeneral Surgery\nHernia Repair. A hernia occurs when an organ or other tissue squeezes through a weak spot in a surrounding muscle or connective tissue. During a hernia repair surgery, the weakened tissue is secured, and defects are repaired. Common types of hernias are ventral and inguinal. Ventral, or abdominal hernia, may occur through a scar after surgery in the abdomen. Inguinal hernia is a bulge in the groin and is more common in men. Hernia repair can be performed using traditional open surgery or MIS. There is a wide range of complexity in hernia repair surgeries and varying surgeon opinions regarding optimal surgical approach. The benefits of minimally invasive and robotic-assisted hernia repair surgery vary by patient.\nColorectal Surgery. These procedures typically involve benign or cancerous conditions of the lower digestive system, in particular the rectum or colon. Common procedures in this area include hemicolectomy, sigmoidectomy, low anterior resection, and abdominoperineal resection. Surgeons have reported that the use of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci surgical system and our latest technologies, such as the SureForm stapler and da Vinci energy products, has enabled them to offer MIS approaches to a broader range of colorectal surgery patients.\nCholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy, or the surgical removal of the gallbladder, is a commonly performed general surgery procedure. Cholecystectomy is the primary method for the treatment of gallstones and other gallbladder diseases. Most cholecystectomies are performed using multi-port MIS techniques, although some surgeons choose to perform cholecystectomy using manual single-port instrumentation. Firefly technology can be used to visualize biliary anatomy in three dimensions beneath the tissue surfaces during multi-port da Vinci cholecystectomies.\nBariatric Surgery.  A body of literature points to the benefit of surgery to treat patients with morbid obesity and its secondary effects, such as diabetes. Sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (“RYGB”) are commonly performed surgical procedures for morbid obesity in the U.S. The body habitus of morbidly obese patients can make laparoscopic surgery physically challenging for the surgeon, and certain surgeons have found value in using the da Vinci surgical system to improve upon the ergonomics when performing MIS in morbidly obese patients. In addition, RYGB can be a technically challenging procedure due to the suturing, stapling, and tissue (bowel) manipulation that is required. Surgeons using the da Vinci surgical system have reported a reduction in a critical complication (anastomotic leaks) relative to laparoscopic RYGB. Also, we believe SureForm 60 may have particular utility in bariatric procedures.\nTable of Contents\n\nUrologic Surgery\nProstatectomy. Radical prostatectomy is the removal of the prostate gland in patients diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer. The standard approach to the removal of the prostate was via an open surgical procedure. The conventional laparoscopic approach is an option, but it is difficult and poses challenges to even the most skilled urologist. The da Vinci surgical system has enabled a large number of surgeons to convert from using an open surgical technique to a minimally invasive technique.\nPartial Nephrectomy. Partial nephrectomy is the removal of a small portion of a kidney (typically, an area of the kidney containing a tumor). Partial nephrectomies are most commonly performed in patients diagnosed with clinically localized renal cancer. Excluding robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci surgical system, there are three common surgical approaches to performing partial nephrectomies: open surgical technique, laparoscopy, and hand-assisted laparoscopy, which is a hybrid of the open and laparoscopic techniques. Surgeons have reported that the da Vinci surgical system’s capabilities may enable a large number of these procedures to be performed through a minimally invasive technique, conferring the benefits of MIS to a broader range of partial nephrectomy patients. Treatment guidelines for patients with localized renal cancer recommend partial nephrectomy due to the benefits that nephron-sparing surgery has in long-term patient outcomes. Published clinical literature has shown that the presence of a da Vinci surgical system is associated with a higher-proportion of patients receiving a guideline-recommended partial nephrectomy.\nGynecologic Surgery\nHysterectomy. Removal of the uterus is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in gynecology and is performed for a variety of underlying benign and cancerous conditions. Hysterectomies can be performed using open surgery (laparotomy) or MIS techniques, which include vaginal, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted approaches. Prior to the clearance of the da Vinci surgical system for use in gynecological procedures in 2005, the majority of hysterectomies performed were open surgeries. We believe that robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci surgical system provides patients the opportunity to receive a minimally invasive treatment as an alternative to an open hysterectomy.\nSacrocolpopexy. The abdominal (open) sacrocolpopexy is one of the operations performed to treat vaginal vault prolapse. Sacrocolpopexy involves suturing a synthetic mesh that connects and supports the vagina to the sacrum (tailbone). A sacrocolpopexy can be performed using a conventional laparoscopic technique; however, it is generally described as difficult and cumbersome to perform. Surgeons have reported that the da Vinci surgical system’s capabilities may enable a larger number of these procedures to be performed through a minimally invasive technique, conferring the benefits of MIS to a broader range of sacrocolpopexy patients.\nCardiothoracic Surgery\nThoracic Surgery. Conventional approaches to surgical procedures in the thorax include both open and video-assisted thoracoscopic approaches. Procedures performed via these methods include pulmonary wedge resection, pulmonary lobectomy, thymectomy, mediastinal mass excision, and esophagectomy. Many thoracic procedures remain open procedures. Surgeons have reported that the use of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci surgical system in thoracic surgery has enabled them to offer MIS approaches to a broader range of thoracic surgery patients and improved clinical outcomes compared to open and video-assisted thoracic surgery in published single-center, multi-center, and national database clinical studies. Also, we believe the EndoWrist 30 stapler and the SureForm 30 stapler may have particular utility in thoracic procedures.\nHead and Neck Surgery\nTransoral Surgery. Head and neck cancers are typically treated by either surgical resection or chemo-radiation, or a combination of both. Surgical resection performed by an open approach may require a “jaw-splitting” mandibulotomy. This procedure, while effective in treating cancer, is potentially traumatic and disfiguring to the patient. MIS approaches via the mouth (transoral surgery) are challenged by line-of-sight limitations dictated by conventional endoscopic tools. Chemo-radiation as a primary therapy does allow patients to avoid traumatic surgical incisions; however, the literature suggests that this modality diminishes patients’ ability to speak and swallow normally. Surgeons have reported that da Vinci transoral surgery allows them to operate on tumors occurring in the oropharynx (i.e., tonsil and base of tongue) and larynx via the mouth and to overcome some of the line-of-sight limitations of conventional transoral surgery.\nDa Vinci Procedure Mix\nOur da Vinci procedure business is broadly split into two categories: (1) cancer procedures and (2) procedures for benign conditions. Cancer and other highly complex procedures tend to be reimbursed at higher rates than less complex procedures for benign conditions. Thus, hospitals are more sensitive to the costs associated with treating less complex, benign conditions. Our strategy is to provide hospitals with attractive clinical and economical solutions across the spectrum of procedure complexity. Our fully featured da Vinci 5 and da Vinci Xi surgical systems with advanced instruments (including the da Vinci energy and \nTable of Contents\n\nda Vinci stapler products) and our Integrated Table Motion product target the more complex procedure segment. Our da Vinci X surgical system is targeted toward price-sensitive markets and procedures. Our da Vinci SP surgical system complements our da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, and Xi surgical systems by enabling surgeons to access narrow workspaces.\nClinical Summary\nThere are over 70 representative clinical uses for da Vinci surgical systems. We believe that there are numerous additional applications that can be addressed with the da Vinci surgical system, and we work closely with our surgeon customers to refine and explore new techniques in which a da Vinci surgical system may bring value. As of December 31, 2024, we had an installed base of 9,902 da Vinci surgical systems, including 5,807 in the U.S., 1,867 in Europe, 1,745 in Asia, and 483 in the rest of the world. We estimate that surgeons using our technology completed approximately 2,683,000 surgical procedures of various types in hospitals throughout the world during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAdditionally, over time, we believe that there are numerous additional applications that can be addressed with our Ion endoluminal system. As of December 31, 2024, we had an installed base of 805 Ion systems, 784 of which are located in the U.S. We plan to seek additional clearances, certifications, or approvals for Ion in OUS markets over time.\nSales and Customer Support\nSales Model\nWe provide our products through direct sales organizations in the U.S., Europe (excluding Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Eastern European countries), China, Japan, South Korea, India, Taiwan, and Canada. We provide products and services in China through our majority-owned joint venture (“Joint Venture”) with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. (“Fosun Pharma”) and its affiliates. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further details on the Joint Venture. In the remainder of our markets outside of the U.S., we provide our products through distributors. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, domestic revenue accounted for 67%, 66%, and 67%, respectively, of total revenue, while revenue from our OUS markets accounted for 33%, 34%, and 33%, respectively, of total revenue.\nOur direct sales organization is composed of a capital sales team, responsible for selling systems, and a clinical sales team, responsible for supporting the systems used in procedures performed at our hospital accounts. Our hospital accounts include both individual hospitals and healthcare facilities as well as hospitals and healthcare facilities that are part of an integrated delivery network (“IDN groups”). The initial system sale into an account is a major capital equipment purchase by our customers and typically has a lengthy sales cycle that can be affected by macroeconomic factors, capital spending prioritization, the timing of budgeting cycles, and the evaluation of alternative products. Capital sales activities include educating surgeons or physicians and hospital staff across multiple specialties on the benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci surgical system or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, total treatment costs, and the clinical applications that our technology enables. We also train our sales organization to educate hospital management on the potential benefits of adopting our technology, including the clinical benefits of robotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci surgical system or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system, in support of their Quintuple Aim objectives.\nOur clinical sales team works on site at hospitals, interacting with surgeons or physicians, operating room staff, and hospital administrators to develop and sustain successful robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy programs. They assist the hospital in identifying surgeons or physicians who have an interest in robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy and the potential benefits provided by the da Vinci surgical system and the Ion endoluminal system. Our clinical sales team provides current clinical information on robotic-assisted surgery or bronchoscopy practices and new product applications to the hospital teams. Our clinical sales team has grown with the expanded installed bases of da Vinci surgical systems and Ion endoluminal systems as well as the total number of procedures performed. We expect this organization to continue to grow as our business expands.\nOur customers place orders to replenish their supplies of instruments and accessories on a regular basis. Orders received are typically shipped within one business day. New direct customers who purchase a system typically place an initial stocking order of instruments and accessories soon after they receive their system.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, placements of our da Vinci surgical systems have tended to be heavier in the fourth quarter and lighter in the first quarter, as hospital budgets are reset. In addition, we have historically experienced lower procedure volume in the first and third quarters and higher procedure volume in the second and fourth quarters. More than half of da Vinci procedures performed are for benign conditions. These benign procedures and other short-term elective procedures tend to be more seasonal than cancer procedures and surgeries for other life-threatening conditions. In the U.S., volumes for procedures associated with benign conditions are typically seasonally higher in the fourth quarter when more patients have met annual deductibles and lower in the first quarter when deductibles are reset. Seasonality outside of the U.S. varies and is more pronounced around local holidays and vacation periods, which have lower procedure volume. The \nTable of Contents\n\ntiming of procedures and changes in procedure volume impact the timing of instruments and accessories and capital purchases. As a result of factors outlined in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Pandemic” below, including the past and potential future recommendations of authorities to defer elective procedures, historical procedure patterns have been and may continue to be disrupted.\nCustomer Support\nWe have a network of field service and technical support engineers across the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia and maintain relationships with various distributors around the globe. This infrastructure of service and support specialists, along with advanced service tools and solutions, offers a full complement of services for our customers, including installation, repair, maintenance, 24/7 technical support, and proactive system health monitoring. We generate service revenue by providing these services to our customers through comprehensive service contracts and time and material programs.\nResearch and Development\nWe focus our research and development efforts on innovation and improvement for products and services that align with our mission: We believe that minimally invasive care is life-enhancing care. Through ingenuity and intelligent technology, we believe that we can expand the potential of physicians to heal without constraints. We employ engineering and research and development staff to focus on delivering future innovations and sustaining improvements that advance our mission. In certain instances, we complement our research and development effort through collaborations with other companies, such as our Integrated Table Motion product offering developed with Hillrom (now a part of Baxter International Inc.).\nManufacturing\nWe manufacture our systems at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California, and Peachtree Corners, Georgia, as well as at our Joint Venture’s facility in Shanghai, China. Our instruments and accessories are produced at our facilities in Sunnyvale, California, and Mexicali, Mexico. Additionally, we have Ion-related manufacturing in Blacksburg, Virginia, and Shanghai, China, and endoscope-related manufacturing at multiple sites in Germany. We are also planning to open a new manufacturing facility in Bulgaria.\nWe purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers (the only recognized supply source available to us) or single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of finished goods relative to our anticipated demand.\nCompetition\nWe face competition in the forms of existing open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and other emerging diagnostic and interventional surgical approaches. Some of these procedures are widely accepted in the medical community and, in many cases, have a long history of use. Our success depends on continued clinical and technical innovation, quality, and reliability, as well as educating hospitals, surgeons, and patients on the demonstrated results associated with robotic-assisted medical procedures using da Vinci surgical systems or Ion endoluminal systems and their value relative to other techniques. We also face competition from several companies that have introduced or are developing new approaches and products for the MIS market. We believe that the entrance or emergence of competition validates MIS and robotic-assisted surgery or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy.\nMoreover, as we add new robotically controlled products (e.g., da Vinci stapling and da Vinci energy products) that compete with product offerings traditionally within the domains of open surgery and/or conventional MIS, we face greater competition from larger and well-established companies, such as Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic plc.\nAdditionally, we currently face, or anticipate facing, competition from companies with products used in open or MIS surgeries, including laparoscopy and alternative multi-port, single-port, or endoluminal systems. We also compete with companies providing other therapeutic approaches for addressing target clinical conditions, as well as companies developing diagnostic solutions that could serve as alternatives to current or planned Intuitive offerings. Companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted medical procedures, or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field, include, but are not limited to, the following: Beijing Surgerii Robotics Company Limited; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Distalmotion SA; Harbin Sizhe Rui Intelligent Medical Equipment Co., Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson; Karl Storz SE & Co. KG; Medicaroid Corporation; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; Noah Medical; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; Shanghai Microport Medbot (Group) Co., Ltd.; Shenzhen Edge Medical Co., Ltd.; and SS Innovations International, Inc. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of medical robotics and become a competitor. In addition, research efforts utilizing computers and robotics for medical procedures \nTable of Contents\n\nare underway at various companies and research institutions. Our revenues may be adversely impacted as our competitors announce their intent to enter our markets and as our customers anticipate the availability of competing products. We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against current or potential competitors, especially those with greater resources.\nIntellectual Property\nWe place considerable importance on obtaining and maintaining patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes.\nWe generally rely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology. For example, we have trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that provide distinctive identification of our products in the marketplace. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses with various third parties to supplement our own robust patent portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned more than 5,300 patents granted and still in force and more than 2,400 patents pending worldwide. We intend to continue filing new patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to seek protection for our technology. Patents have finite terms. The expiration of a patent ends the exclusive rights accorded by the patent for the invention claimed.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur products and operations are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA and the State of California as well as by other countries and regions in which we market and promote our products. In addition, our products must meet the requirements of a large and growing body of international regulations and standards, which govern the design, manufacture, materials content and sourcing, testing, certification, packaging, installation, use, and disposal of our products. We must continually keep abreast of these regulations, standards, and requirements and integrate our compliance into the development and regulatory documentation for our products. Failure to meet these requirements could limit our ability to market our products in those regions that require compliance with such regulations and standards. Examples of standards to which we are subject include electrical safety standards, such as those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (e.g., IEC 60601-ss series of standards), and composition regulations, such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directives applicable in the European Union (“EU”).\nU.S. Regulation\nFDA\nOur products are subject to regulation as medical devices in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, recordkeeping, complaint and adverse event reporting, clearance, approval, certification, promotion, marketing, export, import distribution, and service of medical devices in the U.S. to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses.\nUnder the FFDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II, or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Our current products are Class II medical devices.\nClass II medical devices are those that are subject to general controls, and most require premarket demonstration of adherence to certain performance standards or other special controls, as specified by the FDA, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidance documents.\nManufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FFDCA requesting authorization to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s authorization to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Our current products are subject to premarket notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FFDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device.\nThe FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments.\nIf the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device in the U.S. The FDA has a statutory 90-day period to respond to a 510(k) submission; however, as a practical \nTable of Contents\n\nmatter, clearance often takes longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not “substantially equivalent,” the device may be designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the de novo classification pathway, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.\nThe PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA application, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The FDA, by statute and regulation, has 180 days to review a PMA application, although the review more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. In approving a PMA application or clearing a 510(k) submission, the FDA may also require some additional manufacturing controls, design control activities and approvals, as well as specific post-market surveillance requirements when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients.\nClinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA or de novo request and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of a medical device must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit the promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) for each clinical site. During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping, and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to the FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA, or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.\nAfter a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether a proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), de novo classification, or a PMA or PMA supplement in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until it receives the appropriate marketing authorization. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nIn addition, the FDA may place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition of granting marketing authorization. Moreover, after a device is placed on the market, numerous FDA and other regulatory requirements continue to apply. These requirements include establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; compliance with medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device caused or contributed, or may have caused or contributed, to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; compliance with corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health; the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. In addition, the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims, and that our advertising is neither false nor misleading. In general, we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our intended use statement in our clearances or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims. \nOur manufacturing processes are required to comply with the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). The QSR covers, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, testing, controlling, documenting, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all medical devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires maintenance of extensive records, which demonstrate compliance with the FDA regulation, the manufacturer’s \nTable of Contents\n\nown procedures, specifications, and testing, as well as distribution and post-market experience. Compliance with the QSR is necessary for a manufacturer to be able to continue to market cleared or approved product offerings in the U.S. A company’s facilities, records, and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:\n•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, administrative penalties, and civil or criminal penalties;\n•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;\n•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;\n•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n•refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or\n•criminal prosecution.\nIn addition, the discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.\nProducts manufactured outside of the U.S. by or for us are subject to U.S. Customs and FDA inspection upon entry into the U.S. We must demonstrate compliance of such products with U.S. regulations and carefully document the eventual distribution or re-exportation of such products. Failure to comply with all applicable regulations could prevent us from having access to products or components critical to the manufacture of finished products and lead to shortages and delays.\nOther Healthcare Regulatory Laws\nWe are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our products. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:\n•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal and state healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n•the federal criminal and civil false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities, and the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Laws, which prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act;\n•the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), which imposes criminal and civil liability, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\nTable of Contents\n\n•the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information on certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), teaching hospitals, and certain other health care providers (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; \n•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and\n•certain state laws that require medical device manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring such manufacturers to report information related to payments to clinicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.\nViolations of any of these laws may result in significant penalties, including but not limited to the following: civil, criminal, and administrative penalties; damages; fines; disgorgement; imprisonment; the curtailment or restructuring of operations; loss of eligibility to obtain approvals from the FDA; exclusion from participation in government contracting, healthcare reimbursement, or other government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; integrity oversight and reporting obligations; or reputational harm.\nForeign Regulation\nIn order for us to market our products in countries outside the United States, we must obtain regulatory approvals or certifications and comply with extensive product quality system and composition regulations in other countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals, clearance, or certifications and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Some countries have regulatory review processes that are substantially longer than U.S. processes. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or certification in a timely manner and meet all of the local requirements, including language and specific safety standards, in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines.\nChina\nChina has its own regulatory agency, the National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”). They require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or failure to comply with any regulation may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. In addition to product registration approvals, our system sales into China are also dependent on obtaining importation authorizations and provincial approvals, as well as hospitals completing a tender and hospital listing process under the authorization. In June 2023, the China National Health Commission published the 14th five-year plan quota for major medical equipment to be sold in China on its official website (the “2023 Quota”). Under the 2023 Quota, the government will allow for the sale of 559 new surgical robots into China, which could include da Vinci surgical systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. Sales of da Vinci surgical systems under the quota are uncertain, as they are dependent on hospitals completing a tender process and receiving associated approvals.\nJapan\nMost medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they receive regulatory approval to be sold in Japan. We obtained approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) for our da Vinci Si surgical system in October 2012, for our da Vinci Xi surgical system in March 2015, and for our da Vinci X surgical system in April 2018. In September 2022, we received regulatory clearance for the da Vinci SP surgical system in Japan for the same set of procedures as can be performed on the da Vinci Xi surgical system in Japan. We have received national reimbursement status in Japan for a number of procedures since the approval of our first da Vinci surgical system in 2012. An additional eight da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement in April 2022, including colon resection, and an additional five da Vinci procedures were granted reimbursement in April 2024, including lobectomy for benign conditions. In addition, we received higher reimbursement for da Vinci gastrectomy procedures, as compared to open and conventional laparoscopic procedure reimbursements, and higher reimbursement for certain da Vinci rectal resection procedures, as compared to open procedure reimbursements. The additional reimbursed procedures have varying levels of conventional laparoscopic penetration and will generally be reimbursed at rates equal to the conventional laparoscopic procedures. Given the reimbursement level and laparoscopic penetration for these additional procedures, there can be no assurance that the adoption pace for these procedures will be similar to prostatectomy or partial nephrectomy, given their higher reimbursement, or any other da Vinci procedure. If these procedures are not adopted and we are not successful in obtaining adequate procedure reimbursements for additional procedures, then the demand for our products in Japan could be limited. The \nTable of Contents\n\nprocess of reimbursement for new da Vinci surgical procedures in Japan is led by the surgical societies. The societies submit for reimbursement or incremental reimbursement to the MHLW for their evaluation. The decision to reimburse requires in-country clinical data and is fixed in April of even-numbered years.\nEuropean Union\nThe EU has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling, and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Until and including May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the “EU Medical Devices Directive” or “MDD”), which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the “EU Medical Devices Regulation” or “MDR”). Some of our current certificates have been granted under the MDD. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the MDR requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the MDD with regard to the registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, and vigilance.\nMedical Devices Directive\nUnder the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as the sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter, as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies the essential requirements.\nExcept for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts that relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturer’s quality system (the notified body must presume that quality systems that implement the relevant harmonized standards, which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems, conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the European Conformity mark (“CE mark”) to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.\nThroughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).\nMedical Devices Regulation\nOn April 5, 2017, the MDR was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The MDR establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable, and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensures a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike directives, regulations are directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU.\nThe MDR became effective on May 26, 2021. In accordance with its recently extended transitional provisions, both (i) devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the MDD prior to May 26, 2021, and (ii) legacy devices lawfully placed on the EU market from May 26, 2021, in accordance with the MDR transitional provisions may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the MDR, in particular the obligations described below.\nThe MDR requires that, before placing a device on the market, other than a custom-made device, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators, such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the European database on medical devices (EUDAMED), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address, and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The MDR also requires that, before placing a device on the market, other than a custom-made device, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (“UDI”) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and \nTable of Contents\n\ntraceability of the devices. Each device – and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier (“UDI-DI”), specific to a device, and a production identifier (“UDI-PI”) to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on EUDAMED, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in EUDAMED are expected to become applicable in the first fiscal quarter of 2026 (as EUDAMED is not yet fully functional). Until EUDAMED is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the MDD continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators.\nAll manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system, which has been reinforced by the MDR. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through EUDAMED (once functional) and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors, such as the economic operators in the supply chain, will also be informed. Until EUDAMED is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the MDD continue to apply. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs, which are defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. A serious incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device on the market (e.g., inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer, undesirable side-effect, etc.), which, directly or indirectly, might lead to either the death or serious deterioration of the health of a patient, user, or other persons, or to a serious public health threat.\nThe EU has multiple laws and regulations related to composition of materials, their procurement practices, manufacturing, and disposal, such as the RoHS and WEEE Directives. These laws and regulations broadly cover requirements and risk related to health, safety, and the environment. The laws and regulations can impose restrictions on the use of certain substances (such as, in totality or by composition, percentage weight limits or parts per million limits) and have required reporting to the respective EU authorities, requirements around importations into the EU, requirements around recovery and disposal, as well as disclosure requirements.\nThe advertising and promotion of medical devices are subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the MDR, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced, and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals.\nMany EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts,” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.\nIn the EU, regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and, if necessary, unannounced inspections of companies, as well as suppliers and/or sub-contractors and, where necessary, the facilities of professional users. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements (as applicable) could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities’ observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and, if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction, can take a variety of actions, including untitled or warning letters, fines, consent decrees, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.\nThe aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA, which consists of the 27 EU Member States as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.\nBrexit and the UK Regulatory Framework\nSince January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has been the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for the Great Britain (i.e., England, Wales, and Scotland) medical device market. Following the end of the Brexit transitional period on January 1, 2021, new regulations require all medical devices to be registered with the MHRA before being placed on the Great Britain market. From January 1, 2022, non-UK manufacturers were required to appoint a UK Responsible Person for the purposes of registering devices placed on the Great Britain market. Under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, the MDR applies to medical devices placed on the Northern Ireland market in the same way as it applies to medical devices marketed in the EU. In addition, the Trade Deal between the UK and the EU generally provides for cooperation and exchange of information between the parties in the areas of product safety and \nTable of Contents\n\ncompliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls. As such, processes for compliance and reporting should reflect requirements from regulatory authorities.\nOn June 26, 2022, the MHRA published its response to a 10-week consultation on the future regulation of medical devices in the UK, and the MHRA has stated that it remains its intention to implement the proposals from such consultation through secondary legislation. In addition, on November 14, 2024, the MHRA launched a new consultation on proposals to update the regulatory framework for medical devices in Great Britain, covering four topics, namely (1) a new international reliance scheme to enable swifter market access for certain devices that have already been approved in a comparable regulator country; (2) the new UK Conformity Assessed (“UKCA”) mark and, in particular, proposals to remove the requirement to place such UKCA marking on devices; (3) conformity assessment procedures for in vitro diagnostic devices; and (4) maintaining in UK law certain pieces of “assimilated” EU law, which are due to sunset in 2025. The MHRA consultation is open until January 5, 2025, and it is expected that secondary legislation implementing the proposals will be introduced later in 2025.\nOther countries\nRegulations in other countries, including the requirements for approvals, certification, or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Certain countries, such as South Korea, Brazil, Australia, India, and Canada, have their own regulatory agencies. These countries typically require regulatory approvals and compliance with extensive safety and quality system regulations included in the MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program) that we comply with every year as part of our annual audit program. Failure to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, or failure to comply with any regulation in any foreign country in which we market our products may negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business.\nIn addition, local regulations may apply, which govern the use of our products and which could have an adverse effect on our product utilization if they are unfavorable. All such regulations are revised from time to time and, in general, are increasing in complexity and in the scope and degree of documentation and testing required. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such documentation and testing will be acceptable to any particular regulatory agency or will continue to be acceptable over time. There are further regulations governing the importation, marketing, sale, distribution, use, and service as well as the removal and disposal of medical devices in the regions in which we operate and market our products. Failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in sanctions or fines and could prevent us from marketing our products in these regions.\nData Privacy and Security Laws \nNumerous state, federal, and foreign laws, regulations, and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of health-related and other personal information and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.\nWe collect, process, share, disclose, transfer, and otherwise use data, some of which contains personal information about identifiable individuals including, but not limited to, our employees, clinical trial participants, partners, and vendors. Therefore, we are subject to U.S. (federal, state, local) and international laws and regulations, including those in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”) regarding data privacy and security and our use of such data.\nWe are subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 and applicable national supplementing laws (collectively, the “EU GDPR”) and to the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively, the “UK GDPR”) (the EU GDPR and UK GDPR together referred to as the “GDPR”). The GDPR imposes comprehensive data privacy compliance obligations in relation to our collection, processing, sharing, disclosure, transfer, and other use of data relating to an identifiable living individual or “personal data,” including a principle of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training, and audit.\nThe EU GDPR and UK GDPR also regulate cross-border transfers of personal data out of the EEA and the UK. Recent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding such transfers, in particular in relation to transfers to the United States.\nTable of Contents\n\nThird-Party Coverage and Payment\nOur customers, including physicians, hospitals, and outpatient facilities, typically bill third-party payors for the costs and fees associated with the procedures in which our products are used. In the U.S., in order to receive payment for the procedures performed using our products, our customers must report codes that describe the services or products furnished and determine the medical necessity of the service or whether the service is included in the payors’ policy. In the U.S. and most markets globally where we sell our products, payment for medical services and surgical procedures to hospitals, outpatient facilities, and surgeons (collectively “providers”) is determined by the government, commercial payors (insurers), or both.\nIn the U.S., the CMS and its fiscal intermediaries (Medicare Administrative Contractors) and state Medicaid programs establish reimbursement policies for medical and surgical services at the state and federal level for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and payment policies but also have their own methods and approval processes. Commercial payors in non-capitated contracts commonly establish payment to providers based on a percentage of the Medicare payment rate.\nPhysicians and outpatient facilities bill for medical and surgical services by reporting a combination of billing codes. Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes are created by the American Medical Association (“AMA”) with input from CMS and commercial payors to describe medical and surgical procedures. CPT codes currently exist for minimally invasive surgical procedures, which may involve the da Vinci surgical system, as well as for robotic-assisted bronchoscopy, which may involve the Ion endoluminal system. In general, the majority of payors, including Medicare, consider robotic assistance as a tool used to perform the procedure and do not pay providers more for a procedure that involves robotic assistance using the da Vinci, Ion, or any other robotic system. Because there is often no separate payment for the use of our products, the additional cost associated with the use of our products can affect the profit margin of the hospital or surgery center where the procedure is performed. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient payment from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products or if governmental and private payors’ policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, hospital adoption or utilization of our products could be negatively impacted, and we may not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.\nHospitals bill for inpatient services by reporting ICD-10-PCS codes. CMS is primarily responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to ICD-10-PCS codes. Medicare payments to hospitals for services provided during an inpatient stay are based on the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, each patient discharge is categorized into a Medicare Severity Adjusted Diagnosis-Related Group (“MS-DRG” or “DRG”). Each DRG has an assigned payment weight based on the average resources used for Medicare patients in that DRG, taking into account the patient’s principal diagnosis, surgical procedures, age, discharge status, and additional or secondary diagnoses, among other things. The DRG is a single, bundled payment intended to cover all costs associated with the inpatient admission.\nThe use of robotic technology does not influence the MS-DRG assignment or payment for an inpatient admission related to a surgical procedure. CMS annually updates hospital inpatient and outpatient payments based on hospitals’ charge data. Hospital inpatient and outpatient payments are also adjusted based on whether the hospital is a teaching hospital, its geographic location, and any failures to meet certain quality metrics, among other factors.\nCommercial payors commonly establish inpatient facility payment for providers using published Medicare DRG rates as a benchmark. In some uncommon cases, commercial payors pay for inpatient hospital admissions on a per diem basis. Commercial payment to providers varies depending on the procedure performed, geographic location, contractual allowances, and other factors.\nMedicare and commercial payor payments to facilities for medical and surgical services may not always fully reimburse providers for all costs associated with furnishing these procedures. If payment is insufficient for procedures involving our technology, hospitals and physicians may decide not to use our products.\nIn countries outside of the U.S., payment for surgical services to physicians and facilities differs considerably and varies by country. In some markets, there is a single public payor who provides a global annual budget to hospitals to provide all care to the population served in a designated geographic area. In other markets, private insurance can be purchased or is provided by employers to supplement public health insurance. In some countries, patients may be permitted to pay directly for surgical services; however, such “co-pay” practices are not common (or allowed) in many countries. Further, in many global markets, access to procedures and technology is governed or heavily influenced by Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) organizations, which conduct periodic and extensive evidence-based reviews of the clinical value and cost effectiveness of a new technology. To effectively conduct our business, we may need to seek OUS reimbursement approvals, and we do not know if these required approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. In addition, in some markets, HTA organizations may publish reports with mixed conclusions about the clinical and economic value of our products to the population. Such reviews could negatively impact hospital adoption of our technology.\nTable of Contents\n\nHealthcare Reform\nIn the U.S., there have been, and continue to be, legislative initiatives designed to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), was enacted. The ACA made changes that have significantly impacted healthcare providers, insurers, pharmaceutical companies, and medical device manufacturers. The ACA contained provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansion and appropriated funding to research the comparative effectiveness of healthcare treatments and strategies. To date, this research has had a negligible effect on Medicare coverage and reimbursement decisions as well as influence on other third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA remained in effect in its current form.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA became law. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect through 2032, unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.\nIn the U.S. and abroad, reimbursement is dynamic and subject to change annually by public and private payors. Congress and government agencies may also intervene and pass legislation that is intended to reduce healthcare spending, which could impact market access. Such legislative interventions can vacillate significantly based on government leadership. Other federal or state healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any regulatory or legislative developments in domestic or foreign markets that eliminate or reduce reimbursement rates for procedures performed with our products could harm our ability to sell our products or cause downward pressure on the prices of our products, either of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of business operations.\nSimilar reform measures may be adopted in foreign jurisdictions. For instance, on December 13, 2021, the EU Regulation No 2021/2282 on HTA, amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted. While the Regulation entered into force in January 2022, it will only begin to apply from January 2025 onwards, with preparatory and implementation-related steps to take place in the interim. Once applicable, it will have a phased implementation depending on the concerned products. This Regulation intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including certain high-risk medical devices, and provide the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. It will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the highest potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, and ethical) aspects of health technology and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.\nHuman Capital\nDelivering on our mission depends on our ability to attract, engage, retain, and further develop top talent around the globe. We strive to enable this by making Intuitive an inclusive, diverse, and safe workplace with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. Intuitive provides competitive compensation, benefits, and programs that encourage employee health and wellness as well as foster connections between our employees, the communities, and the customers we serve.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 15,638 full-time employees, with approximately 2,076 in research and development, 7,057 in manufacturing operations, 4,413 in commercial and service operations, and 2,092 in administrative activities. During 2024, the number of employees increased by approximately 1,962. Our employees are based in 29 different countries around the world. Our global workforce consists of a diverse range of highly skilled talent. During 2024, our turnover rate was approximately 8.9%.\nInclusion and Diversity\nIntuitive’s inclusion and diversity (“I&D”) mission is to work to build an environment where every individual can belong and flourish – in our company and the communities we serve.\nWe believe that everyone should feel included and fairly treated, and we embrace the unique qualities that make people who they are. This includes all genders and gender identities, races, ethnicities, ages, national origins, native languages, \nTable of Contents\n\ndisabilities, sexual orientations, body sizes, military backgrounds, cognitive styles, socioeconomic backgrounds, religions, and family structures. We believe in seeking the difference to propel innovation and creativity forward.\nWe have a four-part strategy to guide our I&D efforts: ensuring an inclusive experience, where employees from all backgrounds feel welcome, supported, and valued; building a diverse workforce to fuel innovation and better mirror the customers and patients we serve; continuously investing in and enhancing the fairness of our people practices and sharing progress; and strengthening industry engagement through collaboration with our customers, the broader healthcare community, and shareholders. We aim to pursue this strategy through various initiatives, including assessing our efforts through a compliance lens; our policies prohibit unlawful discrimination against individuals on the basis of any protected characteristic.\nDetails of our employee workforce composition, including a link to our Employer Information Report (“EEO-1”) submission to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), are available on our website. Although we reference the availability of our EEO-1 on our website in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our EEO-1 and any other materials on our website are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any of our other filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act. While matters discussed in such EEO-1 and other website materials may be significant, any significance should not be read as necessarily rising to the level of materiality used for the purposes of our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws, even if we use the word “material” or “materiality” in such materials.\nFrom a governance perspective, maintaining a mix of backgrounds and experience in our Board composition is essential to being able to understand, represent, and reflect the needs of our diverse stakeholders. Currently, five of our 12 Board members (42%) are women, and five of our 12 board members (42%) self-identify as individuals from underrepresented communities (defined as an individual who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, or Alaska Native, or LGBTQ+).\nHealth, Safety, and Wellness\nThe health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we continue to invest and expand. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection, peace of mind, and security, including workplace health and safety best practices integrated into everyday activities and programs that support employee time away from work, family care, mental health, or financial well-being.\nWe continue to evolve our programs in an effort to respond to the interests of our changing workforce, as well as the communities in which we operate, in compliance with government regulations. Each Intuitive location manages overall safety with guidance based on regional, country, and local regulations and best practices.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe provide compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to base compensation, these programs, which vary by country and region, include short-term incentives in the form of annual bonuses and commissions, long-term incentives in the form of stock or cash-based awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, retirement savings plans, healthcare, income protection benefits, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, and flexible work schedules, among many others.\nWe aim to support fair and equitable pay for our employees. Our executive team and Board strongly support this effort. We regularly review pay for internal equity, including with regard to race/ethnicity and gender, and to assess the appropriateness of our compensation structure. We also engage outside counsel to assess compliance with pay equity laws. When we identify potential differences in pay, we research those differences and take actions to resolve them if we deem appropriate.\nIn 2024, we conducted a full pay equity audit for our full-time U.S. workforce, adjusting for job role and location among other factors. Evaluating total target cash compensation, our audit found that our adjusted pay gap relative to self-identified gender was women earn 99.5% of men and our adjusted pay gap relative to U.S. self-identified race/ethnicity was employees of color earn 100.0% of white employees. We are proud to have strong pay practices and policies in place that have helped us to achieve this level of pay equity.\nEmployees are encouraged to share any pay equity concerns with management, Human Resources, or confidentially through our reporting hotline, including anonymously. Intuitive has a non-retaliation policy for raising any workplace concerns in good faith, including around pay.\nTalent Development\nAt Intuitive, we believe that all employees have the potential to grow. To support this growth, we offer a diverse range of development opportunities designed to help employees acquire and apply new technical, functional, and leadership skills.\nTable of Contents\n\nEmployee development at Intuitive commences from the first day and includes comprehensive onboarding programs that teach about our business, our culture, and the skills needed to successfully perform at Intuitive. Subsequently, employees have access to a variety of online learning courses, as well as classroom and cohort-based programs.\nFor people leaders, we provide a 12-month, blended learning curriculum, called the Manager Acceleration Program (“MAP”). MAP is delivered globally and aims to teach our people leaders what it takes to successfully lead and manage at Intuitive. The program covers key leadership expectations as well as fundamental leadership skills. Additional virtual, instructor-led workshops provide timely classes aimed at assisting leaders with important employee processes, such as performance and compensation conversations.\nFurthermore, our talent development initiatives include various team effectiveness assessments and solutions tailored to meet the needs of our growing global teams. These solutions range from cross-cultural dexterity programs to assessing and leveraging individual and team strengths. We gather feedback from our teams annually through our Employee Experience survey, holding leaders accountable for taking action based on the feedback received. In 2024, Intuitive achieved a 92% employee engagement score, signaling a strong employee commitment to our mission and the work we do each day.\nCommunity Programs\nWe believe that building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving opportunities, and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members.\nThe Intuitive Foundation is a nonprofit organization established in 2018 and funded by Intuitive. Since its founding, the Intuitive Foundation has been dedicated to promoting health, advancing education, and reducing human suffering. The Foundation supports outreach programs financially while we provide the volunteers and mentors from within our company. Since its inception, we have contributed $170 million to the Intuitive Foundation to fulfill its mission.\nWe encourage you to review our 2024 Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Report (to be made available in the “About Us — Investors” section of our website at https://isrg.intuitive.com) for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider each of the following risk factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or future results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or future results of operations. In addition, the global economic environment may amplify many of these risks.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nOUR MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE TO PURCHASE OUR COMPETITORS’ PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR MAY NOT ACCEPT ROBOTIC-ASSISTED MEDICAL PROCEDURES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE.\nRobotic-assisted surgery with a da Vinci surgical system or robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with an Ion endoluminal system are technologies that compete with established and emerging treatment options in reconstructive medical procedures or disease management. These competitive treatment options include open surgery, conventional MIS, drug therapies, radiation treatment, and other emerging diagnostic and interventional surgical approaches. Some of these procedures are widely accepted in the medical community and, in many cases, have a long history of use. Technological advances could make such treatment options more effective or less expensive than using our products, which could render our products obsolete or unmarketable. Also, studies could be published that show that other treatment options are more beneficial and/or cost-effective than robotic-assisted medical procedures. We cannot be certain that physicians, or their patients, will choose our products to replace or supplement established treatment options or that our products will continue to be competitive with current or future technologies. For example, in 2023, certain drugs initially approved for use in diabetes patients gained market acceptance for use in weight loss treatment following FDA approvals for weight loss indications. The availability and effectiveness of weight loss drugs have reduced the number of bariatric procedures performed, including those bariatric procedures performed using our da Vinci surgical system, as some patients reconsider the surgical treatment option. At this time, it is difficult to predict the long-term market impact of these drugs, including their long-term efficacy as weight loss drugs and potential drawbacks.\nAdditionally, we currently face, or anticipate facing, competition from companies with products used in open or MIS surgeries, including laparoscopy and alternative multi-port, single-port, or endoluminal systems. We also compete with companies providing other therapeutic approaches for addressing target clinical conditions, as well as companies developing diagnostic solutions that could serve as alternatives to current or planned Intuitive offerings. Companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted medical procedures, or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field, include, but are not limited to, the following: Beijing Surgerii Robotics Company Limited; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Distalmotion SA; Harbin Sizhe Rui Intelligent Medical Equipment Co., Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson; Karl Storz SE & Co. KG; Medicaroid Corporation; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; Noah Medical; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; Shanghai Microport Medbot (Group) Co., Ltd.; Shenzhen Edge Medical Co., Ltd.; and SS Innovations International, Inc. Other companies with substantial experience in industrial robotics could potentially expand into the field of medical robotics and become competitors. Additionally, we expect increasing competition within China for robotic-assisted surgical systems. We may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against current or potential competitors, especially those with greater resources. Our revenues may be reduced due to pricing pressure if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective or less expensive than our products. If we are unable to compete successfully, our revenues will suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or result of operations.\nIn addition, third-party service providers that service da Vinci surgical system and Ion endoluminal system operators may emerge and compete with us on price or offerings. To date, substantially all of our customers have sourced services on their systems from us through service contract commitments or time and materials contracts. Furthermore, there are third-party service providers offering consulting services targeted at analyzing the cost-effectiveness of hospitals’ robotic-assisted medical programs, including procedures performed, placement of systems, and consumption of instruments and accessories. We currently provide similar services and analysis to our customers, but it is difficult to assess the impact that this may have on our business. If we are unable to compete successfully with any third-party service providers, our revenues may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or result of operations.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS DUE TO OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.\nWe manufacture, perform research and development activities, and distribute our products in OUS markets. Revenue from OUS markets accounted for approximately 33%, 34%, and 33% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our OUS operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks including:\n•the failure to obtain or maintain the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property rights due to differing intellectual property protection laws in OUS countries from those in the U.S.;\n•multiple OUS regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products;\nTable of Contents\n\n•changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements, such as the enactment of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. including, but not limited to, the proposed tariff on goods imported from Mexico where we manufacture a significant majority of our instruments and accessories that we sell;\n•protectionist laws, policies, and business practices and nationalistic campaigns that favor local competitors or lead non-U.S. customers to favor domestic technology solutions over imports, which could slow our growth, increase our costs, or make our products less competitive in OUS markets;\n•local or national regulations that make it difficult or impractical to market or use our products;\n•U.S. relations with the governments of the other countries in which we operate;\n•the inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;\n•the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n•the difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing OUS operations, including differing labor relations;\n•the expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign markets;\n•the building and maintenance of an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations, including appropriate business procedures and controls;\n•compliance with anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), UK Bribery Act of 2010 (“UK Bribery Act”), and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\n•adherence to antitrust and anti-competition laws;\n•economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets, including exposure to a higher degree of financial risk if we extend credit to customers in these economies; and\n•business interruptions due to natural disasters, outbreak of disease, climate change, and other events beyond our control.\nWe have increased, and will continue to increase, our operations in China. There is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between China and the U.S., that political, diplomatic, military, or other events could result in business disruptions, including increased regulatory enforcement against companies, tariffs, trade embargoes, or export restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of our products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that we earn on our products. Tariffs can also make our products more expensive for customers, which could make our products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology, or data, which could adversely impact our operations and supply chain and limit our ability to offer our products and services as designed. These measures can require us to take various actions, including changing suppliers and restructuring business relationships. Changing our operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending. Additionally, our joint venture works with and relies on a number of dealers, distributors, and other third parties to commercialize and deliver our products. Any of these events could reduce customer demand, increase the cost of our products and services, or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses or results of operations.\nFor example, in 2020, the U.S. government amended the Entity List rules to expand the requirement to obtain a license prior to the export of certain technologies. In addition, in 2020, a new U.S. regulation seeks to prohibit the U.S. government from contracting with companies who use the products or services of certain Chinese companies. Based on our current understanding of these regulations, they do not materially adversely impact our business at this time. However, we cannot predict the impact that additional regulatory changes may have on our business in the future. These actions or similar actions may result in policies and regulations in response that could adversely affect our business operations in China or may otherwise limit our ability to offer our products and services in China and other parts of the world.\nIn China, we have seen increasing competition in the robotic-assisted surgical system industry from domestic companies as well as a broader central government focus on systematic governance. For example, in July 2023, the Chinese government launched a campaign targeting the healthcare sector. This campaign has resulted in heightened scrutiny by medical institutions with respect to initiating tenders, with some tenders being canceled or delayed without a timeline. The extent and impact of this campaign on our business remains uncertain. In 2024, the effects of this campaign, combined with the competitive dynamics in China, contributed to fewer systems being placed in China than we anticipated. Currently, the extent and impact of this campaign and the competitive dynamics in China on our business remains uncertain.\nIn Israel, we have certain research and development operations primarily related to digital products. Depending on the length and extent of conflicts in the Middle East, including Israel and Iran, there may be adverse impacts to certain research and development timelines.\nTable of Contents\n\nIn the UK, following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government, the UK formally withdrew from the EU and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its relationship with the EU. The EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the “TCA”) was applied provisionally as of January 1, 2021, and entered into force on May 1, 2021. The TCA does not specifically refer to medical devices. However, as a result of Brexit, the EU Medical Devices Regulation will not be implemented in the UK, and previous legislation that sought to mirror the EU Medical Devices Regulation in the UK law has been revoked. The regulatory regime for medical devices in Great Britain continues to be based on the requirements derived from previous EU legislation, and the UK may choose to retain regulatory flexibility or align with the EU Medical Devices Regulation going forward. On January 9, 2024, the MHRA published a roadmap setting out its plans and timelines towards the reform of the regulatory framework for medical devices in the UK. Regulations implementing core elements of the new framework are intended to be in place by 2025.\nPending such reform of the UK regulatory framework, the Government has confirmed that general medical devices compliant with the EU Medical Devices Directive with a valid declaration and CE marking can be placed on the Great Britain market up until the sooner of expiry of certificate or June 30, 2028. Medical devices, including custom-made devices, compliant with the EU Medical Devices Regulation can be placed on the Great Britain market up until June 30, 2030. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, differ from those in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and continue to be based on EU law. The TCA does provide for cooperation and exchange of information in the area of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls (or other similar actions). For medical devices that are locally manufactured but use components from other countries, the “rules of origin” criteria will need to be reviewed. Depending on which countries products will ultimately be sold in, manufacturers may start seeking alternative sources for components if this would allow them to benefit from no tariffs. The rules for placing medical devices on the Northern Ireland market will differ from those in Great Britain. These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and our business would likely be impacted and the demand for our products could be depressed.\nThe U.S. federal government has made changes to the U.S. trade policy, including entering into a successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”), effective as of July 1, 2020. In addition, the U.S. federal government has implemented tariffs on certain foreign goods and may implement additional tariffs on foreign goods. For example, on January 20, 2025, the U.S. presidential administration re-confirmed its intention to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada into the United States as early as February 1, 2025. As we currently manufacture a significant majority of our instruments and accessories in Mexicali, Mexico, a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico would increase the costs of our products manufactured in Mexico and adversely impact our gross profit. Such tariffs and, if enacted, any further legislation or actions taken by the U.S. federal government that restrict trade, such as additional tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist or retaliatory measures taken by governments in Europe, Asia, and other countries, could adversely impact our ability to sell products and services in our OUS markets. Tariffs could increase the cost of our products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that we earn on our products, which could make our products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit our ability to offer our products and services. The ultimate impact of any tariffs will depend on various factors, including if any tariffs are ultimately implemented, the timing of implementation, and the amount, scope, and nature of the tariffs.\nIn certain markets, our OUS sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive and/or less affordable in those OUS markets.\nIf we are unable to meet and manage these risks noted above, our OUS operations may not be successful, which would limit the growth of our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or result of operations.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION, INVESTIGATIONS, AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS, COMPETITORS, AND GOVERNMENT REGULATORS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, DIVERT MANAGEMENT’S ATTENTION, AND HARM OUR BUSINESS.\nWe are, and may become, subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in or outside the ordinary course of business. Certain current lawsuits and pending proceedings to which we are party, including purported class actions, product liability litigation, and patent litigation, are described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nIn particular, our business exposes us to significant risks of patent claims, product liability claims, and competition claims (including antitrust claims), many of which are common in the medical device industry. For example, product liability claims have been brought against us by, or on behalf of, individuals alleging that they have sustained personal injuries and/or death as \nTable of Contents\n\na result of purported product defects, the alleged failure to warn, and/or the alleged inadequate training by us of physicians regarding the use of the da Vinci surgical systems. The individuals who have brought the product liability claims seek recovery for their alleged personal injuries and, in many cases, punitive damages. Product liability claims have resulted in negative publicity regarding our Company, and ongoing or future product liability or negligence claims or product recalls could also harm our reputation. Refer to our risk factor titled “Negative publicity, whether accurate or inaccurate, concerning our products or our company could reduce market acceptance of our products and could result in decreased product demand and reduced revenues” for additional risks related to the potential effects of negative publicity on our business. Also, antitrust claims have been brought against us by third parties looking to compete in the instruments or servicing space and by certain customers.\nThe outcome of these product liability claims and other legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. We purchase and maintain business insurance for certain liabilities and self-insure our product liability claims through a fronting policy. We cannot determine whether our existing business insurance program would be sufficient to cover the costs or potential losses related to our lawsuits and legal proceedings or otherwise be excluded under the terms of any insurance policy. Additionally, regardless of merit, litigation may be time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant legal costs (including settlements, judgments, legal fees, and other related defense costs) and diversion of management attention. We could also be subject to governmental investigations in connection with some of these claims. If we do not prevail in these legal proceedings, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWE OFFER USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING ALTERNATIVE CAPITAL ACQUISITION APPROACHES; AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO AN INCREASED RISK OF LOSSES OF REVENUE AND INCREASED CREDIT RISK, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe are increasingly offering usage-based arrangements as part of our business model. As a result, we are exposed to an increased risk of losses of revenue in any period where the usage decreases. Moreover, our pricing is generally set based on the expected usage of the technology. Therefore, if utilization of our technology falls short of the anticipated levels, we may not be able to recover the costs associated with the technology, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe believe customer financing through leasing is an important consideration for some of our customers and have experienced an increase in demand for customer financing. Lease financing arrangements have the effect of reducing cash flows at lease commencement and, instead, spread them over the life of the lease term, which increases the time taken to recover our product costs and can impact our liquidity. We may experience losses from a customer’s failure to make payments according to the contractual lease terms. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our lease financing arrangements may increase if our customers are adversely affected by changes in healthcare laws, coverage, and reimbursement, economic pressures or uncertainty, or other customer-specific factors. Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risks, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing credit risks relating to these lease financing arrangements. If the level of credit losses we experience in the future exceeds our expectations, such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe also lease our systems to certain qualified customers where the lease payments are based on their usage of the systems. If customers do not perform a sufficient number of procedures on our systems leased under usage-based arrangements, it could impact our profitability on those arrangements and our overall results of operations. Moreover, the usage of those systems and related billings could vary from quarter to quarter, which could result in higher variability in our revenue under those arrangements, including a significant reduction in revenue if the usage ends, fluctuations in our gross profit margins if utilization is different than our expectations, and unpredictable cash flows. Moreover, there is risk in forecasting future utilization of a system and, therefore, we may not set our usage-based rates high enough to maintain our gross profit margins. Additionally, certain of our leasing arrangements allow customers to cancel, return, or upgrade the systems leased prior to the end of the lease term without incurring a financial penalty, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If systems that are not fully depreciated are returned, we could also incur additional losses, as we may not be able to recover the remaining value of those returned assets, thereby negatively impacting our financial results.\nWhile leases, including usage-based arrangements, enable our customers to upgrade and get access to new technologies faster, it may also enable competitors to more easily induce customers to switch to such competitors’ systems. Furthermore, depending on the timing and terms of the upgrade transaction, the amount of revenue generated on the initial and upgraded lease arrangements may not, in the aggregate, generate the same amount of revenue that a traditional sale and trade-in transaction would.\nTable of Contents\n\nOUR RELIANCE ON SOLE- AND SINGLE-SOURCED SUPPLIERS AND ABILITY TO PURCHASE AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF MATERIALS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND IN A TIMELY MANNER OR WITHIN BUDGET.\nSome of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole-sourced suppliers or single-sourced suppliers. We generally purchase components through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of components within our inventory. While alternative suppliers exist and could be identified for single-sourced components, the disruption or termination of the supply of components, or inflationary pressure in our supply chain, could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components, which could affect our operating results. Certain of our sole-sourced suppliers or single-sourced suppliers could be adversely affected by the macroeconomic conditions, such as liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry, that could result in delayed access or loss of access to their uninsured deposits or loss of their ability to draw on existing credit facilities involving a troubled or failed financial institution. A disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products, which could harm our ability to generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction, and damage our reputation and our brand. Furthermore, if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of our products, we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The time and processes associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our products on schedule or within budget, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition, our ability to meet customers’ demands depends, in part, on our ability to timely obtain an adequate delivery of quality materials, parts, and components from our suppliers. An information technology systems interruption, including cyberattacks, could adversely affect the ordering, distribution, and manufacturing processes of our suppliers. Current supply chain constraints include difficulties in obtaining a sufficient supply of engineered raw materials and certain subcontract suppliers being operationally challenged to meet our production requirements. Additionally, prices of materials for some components remain elevated from historical levels due to strong market demand or supply chain cost inflation. If such supply chain constraints and price increases in important supply-chain materials continue, we could also fail to meet product demand, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nNEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS AND INTRODUCTIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe develop and introduce new products with enhanced features and extended capabilities from time to time. We may introduce new products that target different markets than what our existing products target. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful research and development, regulatory clearances, approvals, or certifications, establishment or maintenance of intellectual property rights, pricing, competition, market and consumer acceptance, effective forecasting and management of product demand, inventory levels, management of manufacturing costs and capacity, management of supply costs, including mitigation of unforeseen supply chain disruptions for materials and components, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction.\nWe invest substantially in various research and development projects to expand our product offerings. Our research and development efforts are critical to our future success, and such research and development projects may not be successful. We may be unable to successfully develop and market new products, and the products we invest in and develop may not be well-received by customers or meet our expectations. Our research and development investments may not contribute to our future operating results for several years or ultimately generate significant operating income, and such future contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments. In addition, the introduction or announcement of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or reduce the demand for our current products, thereby offsetting any benefits of successful product introductions and potentially leading to challenges in managing our inventory of existing products.\nOur products are subject to various regulatory processes, and we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and certifications in order to sell our new products. If a potential purchaser believes that we plan to introduce a new product in the near future or is located in a country where a new product that we have introduced has not yet received regulatory clearance or certification, planned purchases may be deferred or delayed. In the past, we have experienced a slowdown in the demand for existing products in advance of new product introductions, and we may experience a slowdown in such demand in the future as well. It is also possible that a new product introduction could cause downward pressure on the prices of our existing products or require us to change how we sell our products, either of which could have material adverse effects on our revenues.\nIf we fail to effectively develop new products and manage new product introductions in the future, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nTable of Contents\n\nWE MAY ENCOUNTER MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS OR DELAYS THAT COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE.\nManufacturing our products is a complex process. We (or our critical suppliers) may encounter difficulties in scaling up or maintaining production of our products, including:\n•problems involving production yields;\n•quality control and assurance;\n•component supply shortages;\n•import or export restrictions on components, materials, or technology;\n•shortages of qualified personnel; and\n•compliance with state, federal, and foreign regulations.\nIf demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders. If we are unable to develop or maintain larger-scale manufacturing capabilities or build new manufacturing capabilities or facilities on schedule or within budget, our ability to generate revenue and maintain gross profit margins as expected will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged, all of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition, as we build new facilities for manufacturing capacity, the development of these facilities is subject to risks relating to our ability to complete our projects on schedule or within budget. Refer to our risk factor titled “We are subject to risks associated with real estate construction and development” for additional risks related to building our new manufacturing facilities.\nAlso, after new manufacturing facilities are completed, we may encounter difficulties transferring our production lines from our existing facilities to the new facilities, which require qualification, validation, and regulatory approval and is subject to all of the risks highlighted above. Moreover, certain new manufacturing facilities are in foreign countries and in locations where we have not previously had manufacturing sites, both of which could increase the risks related to transferring our production lines. The facility transfers may require an increase in safety stock inventory to support the production line transfers, create a substantial backlog of customer orders, or increase costs while the production lines mature, all of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWE EXPECT GROSS PROFIT MARGINS TO VARY OVER TIME, AND CHANGES IN OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGINS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur gross profit margins have fluctuated from period to period, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. Our gross profit margins may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n•changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including the mix of systems sold or leased;\n•changes in the mix of fixed payment or usage-based operating lease arrangements;\n•changes in the portion of sales involving a trade-in of another system and the amount of trade-in credits given;\n•our introduction of new products, which may have lower margins than our existing products;\n•our inability to maintain or reduce production costs;\n•changes in our pricing strategy;\n•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•competition;\n•changes in production volume driven by demand for our products;\n•changes in material, labor, or other manufacturing-related costs, including the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for foreign currency-denominated costs;\n•changes to U.S. and foreign trade policies, such as the enactment of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. including, but not limited to, the proposed tariff on goods imported from Mexico where we manufacture a significant majority of our instruments and accessories that we sell;\n•inventory obsolescence, which may result from maintaining significant inventories of raw materials, components, and finished goods;\n•product recall charges; and\n•market conditions.\nTable of Contents\n\nIf we are unable to offset the unfavorable impact of the factors noted above by increasing the volume of products shipped, reducing product manufacturing costs, or otherwise, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nMacroeconomic conditions, such as inflationary pressure, changes to monetary policy, elevated interest rates, volatile currency exchange rates, credit and sovereign debt concerns, concerns about slowed growth in China and other OUS markets, decreasing consumer confidence and spending, including capital spending, the introduction of or changes in tariffs or trade barriers, and global or local recessions can adversely impact demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Recent macroeconomic conditions have been adversely impacted by geopolitical instability and military hostilities in multiple geographies (including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, including Israel and Iran), monetary and financial uncertainties, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe results of these macroeconomic conditions, and the actions taken by governments, central banks, companies, and consumers in response, have previously resulted in, and may again in the future result in, higher inflation in the U.S. and globally, which could, in turn, lead to an increase in costs and may cause changes in fiscal and monetary policy, including additional increases in interest rates. Other adverse impacts of recent macroeconomic conditions have been, and may continue to be, supply chain constraints, logistics challenges, liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry, and fluctuations in labor availability.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, supply chain constraints due to the current supply chain environment, including difficulties obtaining a sufficient supply of component materials used in our products. If interest rates remain elevated, access to credit may become more difficult, which may result in the insolvency of key suppliers, including single-source suppliers, which would exacerbate supply chain challenges. Cybersecurity breaches also remain a threat to our sustained supply continuity. Such supply chain constraints could cause us to fail to meet product demand, which could result in deferred or canceled procedures.\nAdverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties, or other third parties, or concerns or rumors about these events, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, market-wide liquidity problems. For example, in 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as receiver. Similarly, other institutions have been, and may continue to be, swept into receivership. Uncertainty may remain over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry, and there may be unpredictable impacts to our business and our industry.\nIn a higher inflationary environment, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products and services sufficiently to keep up with the rate of inflation. Impacts from inflationary pressures could be more pronounced and materially adversely impact aspects of our business where revenue streams and cost commitments are linked to contractual agreements that extend further into the future, as we may not be able to quickly or easily adjust pricing, reduce costs, or implement countermeasures. A higher inflationary environment can also negatively impact raw material, component, and logistics costs that, in turn, may increase the costs of producing and distributing our products.\nFurthermore, hospitals and distributors may choose to postpone or reduce spending due to financial difficulties or difficulties in obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products due to elevated interest rates and restraints on credit. Hospitals and distributors may also be adversely affected by liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry, as described above, that could result in delayed access or loss of access to uninsured deposits or loss of their ability to draw on existing credit facilities involving a troubled or failed financial institution. Certain hospitals are experiencing, and may continue to experience, financial and operational pressures as a result of staffing shortages, the supply chain environment, a decrease in government funding in healthcare, and elevated inflation, which could impact their ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, increase the cost of funding, or impede their ability to comply with debt covenants, all of which could impede their ability to provide patient care, defer elective surgeries, and impact their profitability. To the extent that hospitals face financial pressures, delayed access or loss of access to uninsured deposits, delayed access or loss of ability to draw on existing credit facilities, reductions in government spending, or higher interest rates, hospitals’ ability or willingness to spend on capital equipment may be adversely impacted, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, with economic uncertainty, an increase in unemployment rates, and increasing health insurance premiums, co-payments and deductibles may result in cost-conscious consumers pursuing fewer elective surgical procedures, which, in turn, could adversely affect procedure volumes and system demand.\nWe are unable to predict the impact of efforts by central banks and federal, state, and local governments to combat elevated levels of inflation. If their efforts to create downward pressure on inflation are too aggressive, they may lead to a recession. Alternatively, if they are insufficient or are not sustained long enough to bring inflation to lower, more acceptable levels, hospitals’ ability or willingness to spend on capital equipment may be impacted for a prolonged period of time. If a recession \nTable of Contents\n\noccurs, economies weaken, or inflationary trends continue, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, CYBERATTACKS, OR DEFICIENCIES IN OUR CYBERSECURITY COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, CUSTOMER RELATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur information technology systems are critical to the success of our products, help us operate effectively and efficiently, interface with customers, maintain our supply chain and manufacturing operations, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and help us produce our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of existing customers, difficulty attracting new customers, business operation disruptions, diversion of the attention of management and key information technology resources, security breaches, or the unauthorized access to, loss of, or damage to intellectual property, confidential information, or personal information. Our information technology systems, and those of our third-party service providers, strategic partners, and other contractors or consultants, are vulnerable to attack, damage, or interruption from a variety of sources. These sources include computer viruses and malware (e.g., ransomware), malicious code, hacking, cyberattacks, phishing attacks and other social engineering schemes, employee theft or misuse, human error, fraud, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, denial or degradation of service attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state-supported actors, or unauthorized access or use by persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Cyberattacks and other security breaches or disruptions continue to increase in frequency, sophistication, and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect for periods of time, especially as they relate to attacks on third-party providers or their vendors. Such attacks are often carried out by motivated and highly skilled actors, who are increasingly well-resourced. Techniques used to compromise or sabotage systems, including the use of advanced technologies, such as machine learning or generative artificial intelligence (“AI”), change frequently, may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world, may be difficult to detect, and generally are not recognized until after they are launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If our information technology systems, or those of our critical third-party vendors, do not effectively and securely collect, store, process, and report relevant data for the operation of our business, our ability to effectively plan, forecast, and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations could be impaired. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.\nOur business requires us to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personal information. This may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. We have implemented, and our critical third-party vendors may implement, various controls, systems, and processes intended to secure our information technology systems and the information on it. For example, we require usernames and passwords in order to access our information technology systems and use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. We also have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents, and we make ongoing improvements to our information-sharing products in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. However, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. These security measures may be compromised as a result of security breaches by unauthorized persons, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords, or other sensitive information or otherwise attempt to hack into our information technology systems to obtain personal data relating to patients or employees, our confidential or proprietary information, or confidential information we hold on behalf of third parties. In addition, with the prolific use of AI technologies, there is an increased risk of unauthorized or accidental disclosure. For example, our employees, third-party service providers, strategic partners, or other contractors or consultants may input inappropriate or confidential information into an AI system (in particular, a system that is managed, owned, or controlled by a third party), thereby compromising our business operations. Even if the vulnerabilities that may lead to the foregoing are identified, we may be unable to adequately investigate or remediate due to attackers increasingly using tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. The occurrence of any of these events may cause business operation disruptions, diversion of the attention of management and key information technology resources, and possibly lead to security breaches of, or the unauthorized access to, our confidential information or other business data. If the unauthorized persons successfully hack into or interfere with our connected products or services, they may create issues with product functionality that could pose a risk of the loss of data, a risk to patient safety, and a risk of product recall or field action, which could adversely impact our business and reputation. We may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.\nTable of Contents\n\nAs described above, we also rely on external vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems. The systems of these external vendors may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of our own information technology systems, and we are dependent on these third parties to deploy appropriate security programs to protect their systems. In addition to potential exposure to data breaches, security and cybersecurity incidents, or other actions that may compromise the security of or interfere with the function of our systems, defects or vulnerabilities in the software or systems of our external vendors may expose failures in our internal controls and risk management processes, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations and may also harm our reputation, brand, and customer relationships.\nWhile we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect our systems and data, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. We and certain of our service providers are, from time to time, subject to cyberattacks and security breaches and incidents. We consider such cyberattacks or security breaches and incidents to be in the ordinary course of business for a company of our size in our industry. While we do not believe that we have experienced any significant system failure, accident, or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur, it could impair our ability to attract and retain customers for our products, impact the price of our stock, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose us to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines, or judgments against us. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs, and security vulnerabilities could be significant. Our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and harm to our business operations. Moreover, if a security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personal information, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, and use of our products and services could decrease. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability, and regulatory scrutiny, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFurthermore, we may implement changes to information technology systems that could have significant impacts on our manufacturing, sales, and finance functions, among other teams. These impacts may include, but are not limited to, (i) operational disruptions resulting from the slow adaptation of the new information technology systems by employees, whether due to inadequate training or resistance to change, or data loss during the transition to the updated information technology system, including critical customer data, or improper planning leading to the loss of essential software features needed for specific business requirements; (ii) inaccurate financial reporting due to inaccurate data transfer or technical issues; (iii) financial losses due to system failures or cost overruns; (iv) security risks involving potential data breaches, unauthorized access, or loss of sensitive information; (v) compliance risks arising should the updated technology fail to meet regulatory requirements or industry standards; and (vi) strategic risks if the technology implementation fails to deliver the expected benefits.\nWhile we maintain cyber insurance coverage that is intended to address data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or claims that may arise.\nIF OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE THE REVENUE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS.\nThe da Vinci surgical systems, Ion endoluminal system, and our other products represent a novel and advanced approach to performing medical procedures. Achieving and maintaining physician, patient, and third-party payor acceptance of robotic-assisted medical procedures as a preferred method of performing these procedures is crucial to our success. If our products fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, customers will not purchase our products, and we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business. We believe that physicians’ and third-party payors’ acceptance of the benefits of procedures performed using our products will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients. Physicians will not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to existing techniques. Even if we can prove the effectiveness of our products through clinical studies, physicians may elect not to use our products for any number of other reasons. For example, cardiologists may continue to recommend conventional heart surgery simply because such surgery is already widely accepted. In addition, physicians may be slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third-party payors, particularly in light of ongoing healthcare reform initiatives and the evolving U.S. healthcare environment.\nBroad use of our products requires thorough training of patient care teams on their safe and effective use. We expect that there will continue to be a learning process involved for such care teams to become proficient in the use of our products. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training. We may not be able to rapidly train patient care teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products.\nTable of Contents\n\nIF HOSPITALS ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES USING OUR PRODUCTS, IF REIMBURSEMENT IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COSTS OF PURCHASING OUR PRODUCTS, OR IF LIMITATIONS ARE IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENTS ON THE AMOUNT HOSPITALS CAN CHARGE FOR CERTAIN PROCEDURES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT SALES TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS.\nIn the U.S., hospitals generally bill for the services performed with our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, other government programs, and private insurance plans. If hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or if government and private payors’ policies do not cover surgical procedures performed using our products, we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business. In addition, to the extent that there is a shift from an inpatient setting to outpatient settings, we may experience pricing pressure and a reduction in the number of procedures performed. Our success in OUS markets also depends on the eligibility of our products for coverage and reimbursement through government-sponsored healthcare payment systems and third-party payors. Reimbursement practices vary significantly by country. Many OUS markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. Other foreign markets have both private insurance systems and government-managed systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures. Market acceptance of our products may depend on the availability and level of coverage and reimbursement in a country within a particular time. In addition, healthcare cost containment efforts similar to those in the U.S. are prevalent in many of the other countries in which we sell, and intend to sell, our products, and these efforts are expected to continue. Refer to our risk factor titled “Changes in healthcare legislation and policy may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations” for additional risks related to the ability of hospitals to obtain reimbursements.\nIn China, since 2022, several provinces have implemented significant limits on what hospitals can charge patients for surgeries using robotic surgical technology, including soft tissue surgery. To date, these limits have impacted the number of procedures performed in those provinces, which has impacted our instruments and accessories revenue. Companies providing robotic surgical technology, including our joint venture in China, have been meeting with Chinese government healthcare agencies to discuss these developments and to provide feedback. We cannot assure you that additional provincial or national healthcare agencies and administrations will not impose similar limits, and we expect to continue to face increased pricing pressure, both of which could further impact the number of procedures performed and our instruments and accessories revenue in China.\nIF OUR PRODUCTS CONTAIN DEFECTS OR ENCOUNTER PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS, WE MAY HAVE TO RECALL OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR REPUTATION MAY SUFFER.\nOur success depends on the quality and reliability of our products. While we subject components sourced and products manufactured to stringent quality specifications and processes, our products incorporate mechanical parts, electrical components, optical components, and computer software, any of which may contain errors or exhibit failures, especially when products are first introduced. Component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks with respect to our products could result in an unsafe condition for, injury to, or death of a patient. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical procedures, due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure, we and our customers have an increased sensitivity to such defects. In the past, we have voluntarily recalled certain products. Although our products are subject to stringent quality processes and controls, we cannot provide assurance that our products will not experience component aging, errors, or performance problems. If we experience product flaws or performance problems, any or all of the following could occur:\n•delays in product shipments;\n•loss of revenue;\n•delay in market acceptance;\n•diversion of our resources;\n•damage to our reputation;\n•product recalls, including, but not be limited to, product withdrawals from the market, labeling changes, design changes, customer notifications, and notifications to global regulatory bodies;\n•regulatory actions;\n•increased service or warranty costs; or\n•product liability claims.\nCosts associated with defects or performance problems of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTable of Contents\n\nWE UTILIZE DISTRIBUTORS FOR A PORTION OF OUR SALES AND SERVICE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, WHICH SUBJECTS US TO A NUMBER OF RISKS THAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe have strategic relationships with several key distributors for the sale and service of our products in certain countries. If these strategic relationships are terminated and not replaced, our revenues and/or ability to sell or service our products in the markets serviced by these distributors could be adversely affected. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in lawsuits against our distributors related to sales or service of our products performed by them. Refer to our risk factor titled “We are subject to litigation, investigations, and other legal proceedings relating to our products, customers, competitors, and government regulators that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, divert management’s attention, and harm our business.” Our distributors may affect our ability to effectively market our products in certain countries or regulatory jurisdictions if a distributor holds the regulatory authorization or certification in such countries or within such regions and causes, by action or inaction, the suspension of such marketing authorization or certification or sanctions for non-compliance. It may be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming for us to re-establish market access or regulatory compliance in such cases.\nTHE FAILURE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE, AND CHANGES IN OUR EXISTING LABOR RELATIONSHIPS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. For example, our product development plans depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain software, mechanical, electrical, manufacturing, and robotics engineers. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to our success, and competition for qualified personnel is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the constrained labor market and competition for such personnel. Furthermore, as market competition intensifies, there is an increased risk that our current or emerging competitors may attempt to hire our key personnel, which could be achieved through offers of substantial financial incentives or strategic opportunities, aiming to capitalize on their knowledge to accelerate their own product development initiatives. In addition, many of our tenured employees are retirement eligible and have significant historical knowledge or expertise that must be transferred to other employees. If we are unable to effectively safeguard our human capital or mitigate the risks associated with knowledge transfer, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted, and there could be a detrimental effect on our competitive position.\nAdditionally, as a result of any volatility in our stock price, certain long-term incentive benefits, such as stock-based compensation, may be viewed as having less value and, accordingly, could lead to higher attrition. Moreover, we may also encounter higher costs of labor through recruiting expenses, wage rates, retention benefits, or the potential existence of different employee/employer relationships, such as work councils and/or labor unions.\nFluctuations in labor availability globally, including labor shortages and staff burnout and attrition, may also impact our ability to hire and retain personnel critical to our manufacturing, logistics, and commercial operations. The extent and duration of the impact of labor market challenges are subject to numerous factors, including the availability of qualified and highly skilled persons in the markets where we operate and unemployment levels within these markets, behavioral changes, such as fully engaging employees, including those working from home or in a hybrid fashion, prevailing wage rates, health and other insurance and benefit costs, inflation, adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations or government programs, safety levels of our operations, and our reputation within the labor market. The loss of any of our qualified personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete, and related expenses could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMoreover, if we fail to attract, motivate, or retain personnel or if we relax our standards in order to meet the demands of our growth, our corporate culture, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives, and our compliance with obligations under our internal controls and other requirements may be harmed. We believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork, and a focus on execution, as well as facilitates critical knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing. We could also be subject to union or council efforts to organize our employees. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease operational flexibility and could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation.\nPUBLIC HEALTH CRISES OR EPIDEMIC DISEASES, OR THE PERCEPTION OF THEIR EFFECTS, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur global operations expose us to risks arising from public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as, historically, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and the H1N1 virus. These public health crises can divert medical resources and priorities toward disease treatment and adversely affect global economies and financial markets, which can negatively impact the number of procedures performed and our customers’ capital expenditures. Furthermore, public health \nTable of Contents\n\ncrises can cause significant business disruptions, including temporary closures of our facilities and those of our suppliers, as well as reduced access to customers due to measures like travel restrictions. These impacts can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic, which first emerged in late 2019, adversely impacted our operations, supply chains, and expenses. These impacts resulted from a number of impacts and measures, including, but not limited to, healthcare customers diverting resources and priorities towards disease treatment, hospital staffing shortages and supply chain disruptions that impaired their ability to provide patient care, and precautionary measures implemented by governments, businesses, and ourselves. Due to these factors, we experienced significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products as customers delayed or cancelled planned procedures and capital expenditures. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic also caused widespread business disruptions, including travel restrictions, reduced access to our customers, and temporary closures of our facilities and those of our suppliers. For instance, California, where many of our operations and manufacturing facilities are located, implemented risk-reduction orders that limited our employees’ ability to produce and move products through the supply chain. Such disruptions negatively impacted our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Similar effects may occur in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19 or the emergence of another public health crisis.\nAlso, any delays in elective surgeries caused by a public health crisis, outbreak of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious disease may create patient backlogs. The patients in such backlogs may or may not use our products when their surgeries are ultimately performed.\nIn addition, public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases can negatively impact global economies and financial markets, leading to economic slowdowns or recessions. Such conditions may reduce hospital spending, delay product demand, and increase the risk of customer payment defaults or agreement terminations due to liquidity constraints or funding issues. These factors create material uncertainties and risks to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNEGATIVE PUBLICITY, WHETHER ACCURATE OR INACCURATE, CONCERNING OUR PRODUCTS OR OUR COMPANY COULD REDUCE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND COULD RESULT IN DECREASED PRODUCT DEMAND AND REDUCED REVENUES.\nThere have been reports and articles published questioning patient safety and efficacy associated with robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci surgical systems, their cost relative to other disease management methods, and the adequacy of surgeon training. Negative publicity, including statements made by public officials, whether accurate or inaccurate, concerning our products or our Company could reduce market acceptance of our products and could result in decreased product demand and a decline in revenues. In addition, significant negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims, regardless of whether these claims are meritorious. The number of claims could be further increased by plaintiffs’ law firms that use a wide variety of media to advertise their services and solicit clients for product liability cases against us.\nWE COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT, UNINSURED LOSSES, WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nFor certain risks, we do not maintain insurance coverage due to cost and/or availability. For example, we self-insure our product liability risks. We also indemnify our directors and officers for third-party claims but do not carry insurance beyond basic Side A liability coverage to cover that indemnity or the related underlying potential losses. Furthermore, we do not carry, among other types of coverage, earthquake insurance. In the future, we may not continue to maintain certain existing insurance coverage or adequate levels of coverage. Premiums for many types of insurance have increased significantly in recent years and, depending on market conditions and our circumstances, certain types of insurance, such as directors’ and officers’ insurance, may not be available in the future on acceptable terms or at all. Because we retain some portion of our insurable risks and, in some cases, we are entirely self-insured, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insurance coverage could require us to pay substantial amounts, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWE EXPERIENCE LONG AND VARIABLE CONTRACTING CYCLES AND SEASONALITY IN OUR BUSINESS, WHICH MAY CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nThe contracting cycle of our systems is lengthy, because the systems are major capital items and their purchase generally requires the approval of senior management of hospitals, their parent organizations, purchasing groups, and/or government bodies. In addition, sales to some of our customers are subject to competitive bidding or public tender processes. These approval and bidding processes can be lengthy. As a result, hospitals may delay or accelerate system purchases in conjunction with the timing of their capital budget timelines. Further, IDN groups are creating larger networks of system users with increasing purchasing power and are increasingly evaluating their robotic-assisted programs to optimize the efficiency of surgeries and bronchoscopies using da Vinci surgical systems and the Ion endoluminal system, respectively. Further, the introduction of new products could adversely impact our contracting cycle as customers take additional time to assess the \nTable of Contents\n\nbenefits and costs of such products. As a result, it is difficult for us to predict the length of contracting cycles and, therefore, the exact timing of capital sales. Historically, placements of our da Vinci surgical systems have tended to be heavier in the fourth quarter and lighter in the first quarter, as hospital budgets are reset.\nWe have experienced higher procedure growth for a number of benign conditions, including cholecystectomies, hernia repairs, hysterectomies, and certain other surgeries. Many of these types of surgeries may be postponed in the short term by patients to avoid vacation periods and for other personal scheduling reasons. Patients may also accelerate procedures to take advantage of insurance funding cut-off dates. Historically, we have experienced lower procedure volume growth from the prior quarter in the first and third quarters of the year and higher procedure volume growth from the prior quarter in the second and fourth quarters of the year. The timing of procedures and changes in procedure growth directly affect the timing of instruments and accessories and capital purchases by customers.\nThe above factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Because of these fluctuations, it is possible that, in future periods, our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease. These fluctuations, among other factors, also mean that our operating results in any particular period may not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nTHIRD PARTIES MAY OFFER TO SELL REMANUFACTURED OR UNAUTHORIZED INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES TO OUR CUSTOMERS OR PROVIDE UNAUTHORIZED SERVICE ON OUR SYSTEMS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT SAFETY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND OUR REPUTATION.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated through our sales of instruments and accessories. Third parties have offered, and may continue to offer, customers counterfeit instruments and accessories and/or instruments and accessories that have been remanufactured and/or are unauthorized, including instruments that have been remanufactured to support the use of some of our limited-use instruments beyond their labeled useful life. As of the filing date, we are unaware that the FDA or any other regulatory agency has granted 510(k) or equivalent market authorization for the remanufacturing of any instruments for use with a da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, or da Vinci Xi surgical system, but we understand that the FDA has granted 510(k) clearance to two different companies for one remanufactured EndoWrist instrument each used with our da Vinci Si surgical system. Additionally, third parties have provided, and may continue to provide, unauthorized service and maintenance on our da Vinci surgical systems and Ion endoluminal system. While we generally do not approve the use by our customers of unauthorized and unapproved instruments and accessories that lack FDA clearance or other applicable regulatory approval or certification with our systems or the unauthorized service or maintenance on our systems, such activities could potentially result in reduced revenue, increased patient safety risks, and negative publicity for us if these products cause injuries and/or do not function as intended when used, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to laws that regulate or attempt to regulate the manner in which third-party instruments and accessories or third-party service providers interact with our systems, and such laws could also negatively impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO COMPLEX AND EVOLVING LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING DATA PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND RESPONSIBLE USE OF DATA.\nThere are numerous laws and regulations that require Intuitive to protect the personal data it generates, collects, shares, and processes on behalf of itself and/or its customers. In addition to U.S. federal and state privacy laws, there are various comprehensive privacy laws across the globe that we are or may become subject to and that impact our business whether related to customers, employees, products, clinical trials, recruitment, or product research and development. We may be subject to significant consequences, including penalties, fines, restrictions on processing personal information, and/or reputational harm for a data breach or failure to comply with such legal requirements.\nFor example, in the EU, the GDPR requires controllers and processors of data relating to an identifiable living individual or “personal data” to adhere to certain key principles whenever accessing or processing personal data. The EU Data Protection Authorities have been active in their commitment to enforcing the GDPR. The European Data Protection Board, as well as individual member states, continues to refine requirements under the GDPR resulting in increased obligations to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training, transfer impact assessments, privacy notices, and audits. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EEA and the United States remains uncertain. The GDPR provides that EEA member states may, in some circumstances, make their own laws that are more restrictive or prescriptive than GDPR, such as has occurred in France and Germany. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the applicable EEA member state laws may result in significant fines, regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our data processing activities, enforcement notices, assessment notices (for a compulsory audit), and/or civil claims (including class actions). Compliance with data protection obligations imposed by the GDPR and EEA member state laws may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTable of Contents\n\nWe are subject to the privacy laws in our direct and indirect markets including, but not limited to, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, India, Brazil, Canada, and the UK.\nIn the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder, or HIPAA, imposes privacy, security, and breach notification obligations on covered entities and their business associates to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individually identifiable health information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, as a result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if they are required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS through settlement agreements.\nFurther, in the U.S., when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against entities that make deceptive statements about privacy and data sharing in privacy policies, fail to limit third-party use of personal health information, fail to implement policies to protect personal health information, or engage in other unfair practices that harm customers or that may violate Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in proportion to the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, federal and state consumer protection laws are increasingly being applied by the FTC and states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content.\nAt the state level, multiple states have comprehensive consumer privacy laws enacted. Notably, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”) gives California residents expanded rights to access, correct, and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA allows for significant fines by the California attorney general as well as a private right of action from individuals in relation to certain security breaches. Similar laws have passed in other states and are continuing to be proposed at the state and federal level, reflecting the continuing trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S. These developments are increasing our compliance obligations and risk, including risks of regulatory fines, litigation, and associated reputational harm.\nIn China, we are also subject to various aspects of the country’s data compliance regime, including the Cybersecurity Law, the Data Security Law, and the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”). In addition to national laws, regulatory departments, provincial and municipal governments, and Free Trade Zones are left to identify “important data,” the definitions of which may impact our reporting, data protection, and data transfer obligations. Draft guidelines related to medical device and equipment data from the State Administration for Market Regulation and other unpublished rules and guidelines from other regulatory departments may impact Onsite data collection and transfers. With the possibility of more stringent medical data transfer rules in China, customers’ appetite for our digital products including Onsite, Telepresence, and Case Insights may become impacted in the future.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with or make effective modifications to our policies or to comply with any federal, state, or international privacy, data-retention, or data-protection-related laws, regulations, orders, or industry self-regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, a loss of customer confidence, damage to our brand and reputation, and a loss of customers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, various federal, state, and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data-retention, and data-protection issues, including laws or regulations mandating disclosure to domestic or international law enforcement bodies, which could adversely impact our business or our reputation with customers. For example, some countries have adopted laws mandating that some personal information regarding customers in their country be maintained solely in their country. Having to maintain local data centers and redesign products, services, and business operations to limit personal information processing to within individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly.\nThe European Strategy for Data includes a collection of laws focused on ensuring fundamental principles (including doing business in an ethical way, respecting fundamental rights of individuals, not exploiting individuals, and transparency in collection and use of data) are promoted and adhered to in support of innovation for the benefit of the community. In particular, the AI Act, European Health Data Space, and Data Act and Data Governance Acts regulate personal and non-personal data as well as artificial intelligence. These laws are meant to be read and interpreted together (and in concert with the GDPR), ensuring that innovation respects individuals’ fundamental rights and that businesses act with integrity. The Data Act and European Health Data Space Act provide individual and organizational users of certain systems and devices the right to access a broad range of information not previously available and include, in some cases, rights to secondary uses of such data. These \nTable of Contents\n\nobligations may be interpreted in ways that require us to modify our business practices and products to maintain compliance, potentially increasing costs and operational complexity.\nMoreover, some of the AI features of our products involve, or may involve, the processing of personal data and may be subject to laws, policies, legal obligations, and codes of conduct related to privacy and data protection, each of which may be interpreted in ways that may affect the way in which we engage with machine learning and require us to make changes to our business practices and products to comply with such obligations. Our use of AI technologies may involve the storage and transmission of confidential or sensitive information, including personal information of employees, customers, and others, as well as protected health information of clients’ patients. In addition, due to the sensitive nature of the information, the security features of our computers and systems, network, and communications systems infrastructure are critical to the success of our business.\nONGOING AND FUTURE GLOBAL CONFLICTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIn February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. Russia’s military actions against Ukraine have resulted in substantial expansion of sanction programs imposed by the United States, the European Union, and other countries against Russia, Belarus, the Crimea Region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic.\nIn response, the Russian authorities also imposed significant currency control measures, restrictions on transacting with non-Russian parties, export controls, and other economic and financial restrictions. Related sanctions, export controls, or other actions that may be initiated by countries including the U.S., the European Union, or Russia (e.g., potential cyberattacks, disruption of energy flows, etc.) could adversely affect the global economy, financial markets, energy supply and prices, certain critical materials and metals, supply chains, and global logistics and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity, or results of operations.\nAdditionally, in October 2023, armed conflict escalated between Israel and Hamas. Hostilities between Israel and Hamas could persist, escalate, or expand to involve more countries and regions in the Middle East. As a result of such disruptions, we may experience in the future extended lead times, delays in supplier deliveries, and increased freight costs. The risk of ongoing supply disruptions may further result in delayed deliveries of our products.\nWe are actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia and the conflict between Israel and Hamas and assessing the impacts on our business, including our business partners and customers. To date, we have not experienced any material interruptions in our infrastructure, supplies, technology systems, or networks needed to support our operations. We cannot predict the progress, outcome, or consequences of the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza regions or their impacts on the global economy.\nThe length, impact, and outcome of ongoing military conflicts is highly unpredictable and could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, trade disputes or trade barriers, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences, an increase in global shipping expenses, greater volatility in foreign exchange and interest rates, an increase in cyberattacks and espionage, and other unforeseen business disruptions. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions, other consequences, such as restrictions on transactions or banning the export of energy products, including natural gas, and the resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Impacts to our business may include, but are not limited to, a reduction in procedures performed, reduced demand for our products, limitations on hospitals’ ability to spend on capital equipment and in healthcare spending in general, and supply disruption. Any such disruption may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nINCORPORATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGIES INTO OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND OPERATIONS MAY RESULT IN LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS OR HAVE OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOur current operations, products, and services use AI technologies, including machine learning. Examples of our current uses of machine learning include (i) using algorithms to process video and machine data to identify surgical activities and surgical indicators to support learning, teaching, and practice management, and (ii) using algorithms to support surgical planning and navigation. Future innovations in our products and services will likely continue to incorporate AI, and these applications may become important in our operations over time, for example, our development of machine learning-enabled medical devices (“MLMDs”).\nAs with many technological innovations, there are significant risks and challenges involved in maintaining and deploying these technologies, and there can be no assurance that the usage of such technologies will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability.\nTable of Contents\n\nOur ability to continue to maintain or use such technologies may be dependent on access to specific third-party software and infrastructure, such as processing hardware, and we cannot control the availability or pricing of such third-party software and infrastructure, especially in a highly competitive environment. Our products and services may not compete effectively with alternative products and services if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technologies into our products and services. In addition, several aspects of intellectual property protection in the field of AI are currently under development, and there is uncertainty and ongoing litigation in different jurisdictions as to the degree and extent of protection warranted for AI technologies and relevant system input and outputs. If we fail to obtain protection for the intellectual property rights concerning our AI technologies, or later have our intellectual property rights invalidated or otherwise diminished, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing products, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations. Refer to our risk factor titled “If we are unable to fully protect and successfully defend our intellectual property from use by third parties, our ability to compete in the market may be harmed” for additional risks related to intellectual property.\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding AI is also evolving, and the use of machine learning technologies may expose us to an increased risk of regulatory enforcement and litigation. As the FDA and other regulatory authorities continue to develop and incorporate such principles into their regulation of machine learning medical devices, it is possible that medical products using AI and machine learning will become subject to significant additional oversight, including with respect to premarket review, modification, monitoring, maintenance, and device performance.\nIn the U.S., an executive order was issued in October 2023 on the Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Development and Use of AI, emphasizing the need for transparency, accountability, and fairness in the development and use of AI, including in the healthcare industry. The order seeks to balance fostering innovation with addressing risks associated with AI by providing eight guiding principles and priorities, such as ensuring that consumers are protected from fraud, discrimination, and privacy risks related to AI. The order also calls for future regulations from various agencies, such as the Department of Commerce (to draft guidance for detecting and authenticating AI content) and the Federal Trade Commission (to ensure fair competition and reduce consumer harm). In alignment with the order, other agencies have published guidance. Agencies such as the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission have also issued proposed rules governing the use and development of AI technologies. Further, legislation related to AI technologies has been introduced at the federal level and is advancing at the state level. For example, on March 13, 2024, Utah passed the Utah AI Policy Act, which took effect in May 2024, imposing certain disclosure requirements on the use of AI and, on May 17, 2024, Colorado enacted the Colorado AI Act, which will take effect in February 2026. Further, the California Privacy Protection Agency is currently in the process of finalizing regulations under the CCPA regarding the use of automated decision-making. Such additional regulations may impact our ability to develop, use, and commercialize AI technologies in the future.\nApart from the U.S., policymakers in key jurisdictions, such as the EU, are actively working on legislation and regulations to encourage the development and use of ethical and safe AI technologies. For example, on May 21, 2024, the European Union legislators approved the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (“EU AI Act”), which establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market. The EU AI Act enters into force on August 2, 2024, and the majority of the substantive requirements will apply from August 2, 2026. The EU AI Act will apply to companies that develop, use, and/or provide AI in the EU and includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI, and foundation models, and proposes fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover. In addition, on September 28, 2022, the European Commission proposed two Liability Directives seeking to establish a harmonized civil liability regime for AI in the EU in order to facilitate civil claims in respect of harm caused by AI and to include AI-enabled products within the scope of the EU’s existing strict product liability regime. These Liability Directives were published in the Official Journal of the EU on July 12, 2024, and entered into force on August 1, 2024. The EU AI Act and the Liability Directives will have a material impact on the way AI is regulated in the EU. Recent case law from the CJEU has also taken an expansive view of the scope of the GDPR’s requirements around automated decision-making and introduced uncertainty in the interpretation of these rules. The EU AI Act and developing interpretation and application of the GDPR in respect of automated decision-making, together with developing guidance and/or decisions in this area, may affect our use of AI technologies and our ability to provide, improve, or commercialize our business, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOther jurisdictions where we operate have already or are also expected to introduce guidelines and regulations around the use of AI within the next few years. The regulations may impose onerous obligations and may require us to rework or reevaluate improvements to be compliant, potentially increasing costs. \nA breach or failure in our security measures could occur from a variety of circumstances and events, including third-party action, employee negligence or error, malfeasance, computer viruses, cyberattacks, or ransom-related attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software and databases, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, or catastrophic events, and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse \nTable of Contents\n\neffect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. For more information on risks associated with the processing of confidential and sensitive information, including personal information, refer to our risk factor titled “Information technology system failures, cyberattacks, or deficiencies in our cybersecurity could harm our business, customer relations, financial condition, or results of operations.”\nThough we have taken steps to be thoughtful in our development, training, and implementation of machine learning, including taking steps to comply with the laws and frameworks discussed above that are currently in effect, our machine learning-related processing could pose certain risks to our customers, including patients, clinicians, and healthcare institutions, and it is not guaranteed that regulators will agree with our approach to limiting these risks or to our compliance more generally. Risks can include, but are not limited to, the potential for errors or inaccuracies in the algorithms or models used by the MLMDs, the potential for bias or inaccuracies in the data used to train the MLMDs, the potential for improper processing of personal information that could lead to deprecation of our algorithms, and the potential for cybersecurity breaches that could compromise patient data or device functionality. Such risks could negatively affect the performance of our products, services, and business, as well as our reputation and the reputations of our customers, and we could incur liability through the violation of laws or contracts to which we are a party or civil claims.\nDISRUPTIONS AT THE FDA AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR NOTIFIED BODIES COULD HINDER THEIR ABILITY TO HIRE, RETAIN, OR DEPLOY PERSONNEL, OR OTHERWISE PREVENT PRODUCTS FROM BEING DEVELOPED, CLEARED, CERTIFIED, APPROVED, OR COMMERCIALIZED IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nHospitals, health systems, and physicians depend on a number of government agencies and services to effectively deliver healthcare to their patients. A prolonged government shutdown could impact inspections, regulatory review and certifications, grants, or approvals or could cause other situations that could impede their ability to effectively deliver healthcare, including attempts to reduce payments and other reimbursements to hospitals by federal healthcare programs. These situations could adversely affect our customers’ ability to perform procedures with our devices and/or their decisions to purchase additional products from us.\nIn addition, the ability of the FDA, foreign authorities, and notified bodies to review and clear, approve, or certify new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, the ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies or notified bodies, including a prolonged government shutdown, may cause significant regulatory delays and, therefore, delay our efforts to seek clearances, approvals, or certifications from the FDA, foreign authorities, and notified bodies and adversely affect business travel and the import and export of products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times, and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nIf a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns prevent the FDA, other regulatory authorities, or notified bodies from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA, other regulatory authorities, or notified bodies to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2019, the FDA postponed most inspections of domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities at various points. Separately, in the EU, their designation process experienced considerable delays during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the EU, notified bodies must be officially designated to certify products and services in accordance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Despite the increase in designations, the current number of notified bodies designated under the EU Medical Devices Regulation remains significantly lower than the number of notified bodies designated under the previous regime. The current designated notified bodies are, therefore, facing a backlog of requests, and review times have lengthened. This situation could impact our ability to grow our business in the EU and EEA.\nWE MAY INCUR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE.\nOur operating results are subject to volatility due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects our foreign currency-denominated revenue. Gross profit margins on foreign currency-denominated revenue could also be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as we may not be able to raise local prices to fully offset the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Conversely, the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to our foreign currency-denominated revenue and earnings, may cause us to reduce pricing on our products in \nTable of Contents\n\nmarkets that are not priced in U.S. dollars and may cause us to incur losses on our foreign currency hedging instruments, thereby limiting the benefit that strengthened foreign currencies could have on our results of operations.\nWe attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity, and expense. Although we have established a hedging program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily related to transactions denominated in the Euro, the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Korean Won, the New Taiwan Dollar, and the Swiss Franc, and we regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments as necessary, our hedging activities may not offset all of the adverse financial impact caused by unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. See “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional discussion on the impact of foreign exchange risk.\nIF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR COLLABORATION, LICENSING, JOINT VENTURE, STRATEGIC ALLIANCE, OR PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nFrom time to time, we enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, or partnerships to complement or augment our research and development, product development, training, procedure development, marketing, and commercialization efforts. For example, in 2016, we entered into an agreement to form the Joint Venture. In 2019, the Joint Venture acquired certain assets related to the da Vinci distribution business of Chindex, a subsidiary of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co. Ltd. (“Fosun Pharma”), following which the Joint Venture began direct distribution operations for da Vinci surgical system products and services in China. There can be no assurance that we and the Joint Venture can successfully complete development of robotic-assisted medical devices or that we and the Joint Venture will successfully commercialize such products. There can also be no assurance that the Joint Venture will not require additional contributions to fund its business, that the Joint Venture will remain profitable, or that the expected benefits of the acquisition of certain assets of Chindex will be realized.\nProposing, negotiating, and implementing collaborations, in-licensing agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, or partnerships may be a lengthy and complex process. In addition, other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, technology, or other business resources, may compete with us for these opportunities or arrangements. As a result, we may not identify, secure, or complete any such arrangements in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or on otherwise favorable terms, if it all. There can be no assurance that we will realize the expected benefits from these alliances. In addition, we may not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding any collaboration or other arrangement, which could create the potential risk of creating impasses on decisions, and our alliances may have economic or business interests that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our interests. It is possible that conflicts may arise in these relationships, such as conflicts concerning the achievement of performance milestones or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations, termination rights, or the ownership or control of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. These alliances can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of the parties involved, and we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties.\nThese alliances may also involve significant costs and divert the focus and attention of our management and other key personnel. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, or disrupt our ordinary business activities. Such arrangements may also expose us to numerous known and unknown risks, including unique risks with respect to the economic, political, and regulatory environment of any foreign entities with whom we partner, including Fosun Pharma. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIF WE FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY ACQUIRE OR INTEGRATE NEW BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, AND TECHNOLOGY, WE MAY NOT REALIZE EXPECTED BENEFITS, OR OUR BUSINESS MAY BE HARMED.\nWe need to grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands, and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may decide to grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses, products, or technologies rather than through internal development.\nIdentifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to identify appropriate candidates or successfully complete identified acquisitions. In addition, completing an acquisition can divert our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could harm our business and affect our financial results. Even if we complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations, products, technologies, or employees into our operations or may not fully realize some of the expected synergies. An acquired company may have deficiencies in product quality, regulatory marketing authorizations or certifications, or intellectual property protections, which are not detected during due diligence activities or are unasserted at the time of acquisition. It may be \nTable of Contents\n\ndifficult, expensive, and time-consuming for us to re-establish market access, regulatory compliance, or cure such deficiencies in product quality or intellectual property protection in such cases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIntegrating an acquisition can also be expensive and time-consuming and may strain our resources. In many instances, integrating a new business will also involve implementing or improving internal controls appropriate for a public company at a business that lacks them. In addition, we may be unable to retain the employees of acquired companies or the acquired company’s customers, suppliers, distributors, or other partners for a variety of reasons, including that these entities may be our competitors or may have close relationships with our competitors. Furthermore, acquired companies may have less mature or less sophisticated information technology systems, securities practices, or training, which may result in an increased risk of security and cybersecurity incidents when such companies are integrated. For example, in 2020, we acquired Orpheus Medical Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“Orpheus Medical”) to deepen and expand our integrated informatics platform. The integration of this acquisition involved complex operations across different geographic locations and new products, distribution networks, and legal jurisdictions. Failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS.\nOur investment portfolio includes both domestic and international investments. The credit ratings and pricing of our investments can be negatively affected by liquidity concerns, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could fluctuate substantially. Our other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of investments, impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity securities and other investments, changes in interest rates, increases or decreases in cash balances, volatility in foreign exchange rates, and changes in the fair value of derivative instruments. Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty could increase the risk that actual amounts realized on our investments may differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them.\nThe value of our investments may also decline due to instability in the global financial markets, which may reduce the liquidity of securities included in our portfolio. For example, the closure of SVB and other institutions swept into receivership and the appointment of the FDIC as receiver in 2023 created bank-specific and broader financial institution liquidity risk and concerns. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits exceed insured limits. Future adverse developments with respect to these financial institutions or the broader financial services industry may impair our ability to access capital needed to support near-term working capital needs, whether from our existing investment and deposit accounts and credit facilities or otherwise, and may lead to market-wide liquidity shortages and create additional market and economic uncertainty. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could also result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations.\nOur two Intuitive Ventures funds invest in early-stage companies, which involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, uncertainties inherent in research and development; uncertainties regarding the ability of Intuitive Ventures to identify investment candidates; uncertainties regarding the success of Intuitive Ventures’ investments; uncertainties and variables inherent in the operating and financial performance in investments made, including, among other things, competitive developments and general economic, political, business, industry, regulatory and market conditions; future exchange and interest rates; and changes in tax and other laws, regulations, rates and policies.\nThere can be no assurance that we will realize a positive return on our strategic investments. Further, if we invest in privately held companies, valuations of such companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data. If we determine that our investments in privately held companies have experienced a decline in value, we may be required to record impairments, which could be material and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWhile we have not realized any significant losses on our cash equivalents, marketable securities, or other investments, future fluctuations in their value could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and other jurisdictions around the world. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic and/or political conditions. A number of other factors may also impact our future effective tax rate, including:\n•the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n•the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\nTable of Contents\n\n•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n•increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired intangibles and impairment of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n•changes in the availability of tax credits, tax holidays, and tax deductions;\n•changes in share-based compensation;\n•changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; and\n•changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe are unable to predict what changes to the tax laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions may be enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, including tax law changes resulting from the base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project and the Two Pillar Solution undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which includes a global minimum tax rate. Various countries have adopted, or have announced plans to adopt, new tax laws to align with the global minimum tax. These changes could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REAL ESTATE CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT.\nThe development of our facilities is subject to risks relating to our ability to complete our projects on schedule or within budget. Factors that may result in a development project being prevented or delayed from completion or exceeding budget include, but are not limited to (i) construction delays due to labor challenges, poor weather, defects, or cost overruns, which may increase project development costs; (ii) cost escalations associated with materials, including changes in availability, proximity, and cost of materials, such as steel, cement, concrete, aggregates, oil, fuel, and other construction materials, including potential risks arising from geopolitical conflicts, changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries, changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as cost escalations associated with subcontractors and labor; (iii) the discovery of hazardous or toxic substances, or other environmental, culturally-sensitive, or related issues; (iv) an inability to obtain, or a significant delay in obtaining, zoning, construction, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and authorizations; (v) difficulty in complying with local, city, county, and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision, utilities, and water quality, as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats; (vi) insufficient infrastructure (e.g., water, sewer, and roads) capacity or availability to serve the needs of our projects; (vii) failure to achieve or sustain anticipated occupancy levels; (viii) condemnation of all or parts of development or operating properties, which could adversely affect the value or viability of such projects; and (ix) natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, or flooding.\nCLIMATE CHANGE, NATURAL DISASTERS, OR OTHER EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nNatural disasters, terrorist activities, and other events beyond our control including, but not limited to, internet security threats and violence motivated by political or social causes, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Moreover, global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. The impacts of climate change may include physical risks (such as frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs, transition risks, shifts in market trends, and other adverse effects. Such impacts may disrupt parties in our supply chain, our customers, and our operations. For example, the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and their aftermath, created economic uncertainty and disrupted economic activities in Japan, including a reduction in hospital spending. More recently in September and October 2024, Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton caused economic uncertainty and business disruptions in the Southeast region of the U.S.\nPhysical risks associated with climate change are subject to increasing societal, regulatory, and political focus in the U.S., the EU, and globally. Shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity, or duration of certain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, extreme temperatures, or flooding, which could cause more significant business and supply chain interruptions, damage to our products and facilities as well as the infrastructure of hospitals, medical care facilities, and other customers, reduced workforce availability, increased costs or reduced supply of raw materials and components, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues than what we have experienced in the past from such events. The geographic location of our California headquarters and many of our manufacturing facilities, as well as the facilities of certain of our key suppliers and service providers, subject them to earthquake, drought, and wildfire risks. If a major earthquake, wildfire, or other natural disaster were to damage our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers and service providers, or impact the ability of our employees or the employees of our suppliers and service providers to travel to their workplace, we may experience potential impacts ranging \nTable of Contents\n\nfrom production and shipping delays to lost revenues and increased costs, which could harm our business. Moreover, periods with increased drought and annual periods of wildfire danger may increase the probability of planned power outages in the communities where we work and live. For example, in October 2019, Pacific Gas and Electric, the public electric utility in the Northern California region, used planned power outages to avoid and contain wildfires sparked during strong wind events by downed power lines or equipment failure. If prolonged or frequent, such planned blackouts could impact our operations and the operations of our suppliers and service providers located in the Northern California region. While this danger has a low assessed risk of disrupting normal business operations, it has a potential impact on our employees’ abilities to commute to work or to work from home and stay connected effectively. We do not have multiple-site capacity for all of our operations in the event of a business disruption, and we are predominantly self-insured and may not be able to sufficiently cover losses or additional expenses that we may sustain. Furthermore, the impacts of global climate change on water resources may result in water scarcity, which could impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs.\nIn addition, the increasing concern over climate change has resulted, and may continue to result, in more legal and regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions, alternative energy policies, and sustainability initiatives. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet our regulatory obligations. For example, under the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), we will be required to make certain disclosures in 2026 relating to our ESG impacts, risks, and opportunities for 2025, which may require that we change the processes by which we currently collect ESG-related data about our business. Furthermore, as ESG-related laws continue to evolve in scope and complexity, we may need to change the processes by which we currently operate our business and manage our supply chain to comply with these evolving legal and regulatory requirements, which, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. For instance, changes in requirements may adversely affect raw material sourcing from suppliers, our manufacturing operations and those of our suppliers, and the distribution of our products. Further, there may be increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from the market and other stakeholders with respect to ESG practices. Any such regulatory changes or increased market expectations could also have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions, including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and comply with other regulatory requirements or stakeholder expectations. If we fail to comply with certain ESG-related laws, our products become non-compliant with such laws, or we fail to meet the expectations of our stakeholders on ESG-related matters, it could result in a loss of market access or a decline in our success in competitive bidding or public tender processes, and we could incur costs or face other sanctions, such as restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions, fines, and/or civil or criminal sanctions.\nCONSOLIDATION IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe healthcare industry has been consolidating, and organizations continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our healthcare provider customers. Numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators, and third-party payers to curb the rising cost of healthcare have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power within the markets in which we sell our products. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services is expected to continue to intensify, resulting in pricing pressures and decreased average selling prices. In addition, for smaller hospitals or groups that do not consolidate with larger networks, these entities may face increasing cost and/or competitive pressures, which could impact their ability to purchase additional products and services from us or make contractual payments over time. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party payor coverage and reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, new entrants, technology, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further consolidation, which may exert further downward pressure on prices of our products and services and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWE USE ESTIMATES, MAKE JUDGMENTS, AND APPLY CERTAIN METHODS IN DETERMINING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND IN MEASURING THE PROGRESS OF OUR BUSINESS. AS THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND METHODS CHANGE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRESS OF OUR BUSINESS COULD VARY.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in any of our assumptions may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nWe utilize methods for determining surgical market sizes, the number and type (cancerous or benign) of certain procedures performed, and the installed base of our systems that involve estimates and judgments, which are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our estimates of surgical market sizes, the number and type of procedures performed, or the installed base of our systems do not have an impact on our results of operations but are used to estimate the \nTable of Contents\n\nprogress of our business. Estimates and judgments for determining surgical market sizes, the number and type of procedures, and the installed base of our systems and the accuracy of these estimates may be impacted over time with changes in treatment modalities, hospital reporting behavior, system internet connectivity, distributor reporting behavior, increases in procedures per field employee, and other factors. In addition, from time to time, we may change the method for determining market sizes, the number and type of procedures, and the installed base of our systems, causing variation in our reporting.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nCOMPLYING WITH FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATIONS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS, AND OUR FAILURE TO FULLY COMPLY COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.\nBecause our products are commercially distributed, numerous quality and post-market regulatory requirements apply, including the following:\n•continued compliance with the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during the development and manufacturing process;\n•labeling regulations, including the FDA’s general prohibition against false or misleading statements in the labeling or promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses;\n•stringent complaint reporting and Medical Device Reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers keep detailed records of investigations or complaints against their devices and report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;\n•adequate use of the corrective and preventive actions process to identify and correct or prevent significant, systemic failures of products or processes or in trends that suggest the same; and\n•the reporting of corrections, recalls, and removals, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA recalls and field corrective actions taken to reduce a risk to health or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may pose a risk to health.\nWe are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from inspectional observations (as set forth on FDA Form-483) to a public Warning Letter to more severe civil and criminal sanctions, including the seizure of our products and equipment or ban on the import or export of our products. The FDA has, in the past, issued and could, in the future, issue Warning Letters or other adverse communications to us. If we fail to satisfy or remediate the matters discussed in any such Warning Letters or communications, the FDA could take further enforcement actions, including prohibiting the sale or marketing of the affected product. Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The receipt of a Warning Letter could place certain limits on the ability to obtain FDA-issued Certificates to Foreign Government (“CFGs”) used for new and re-registration of products in certain other countries.\nThe FDA also strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion, and other activities relating to the marketing of our products. Medical devices may be promoted only for their cleared or approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the cleared or approved label. It is possible that federal or state enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under a variety of statutory authorities, including under the FFDCA, as well as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, any modification or change of medical devices cleared for the market requires the manufacturer to make a determination whether the change is significant enough to require new 510(k) clearance. We have created labeling, advertising, and user training for the da Vinci surgical systems to describe specific surgical procedures that we believe are fully within the scope of our existing 510(k) indications for use stated in our 510(k) clearances. Although we have relied on expert in-house and external staff, consultants, and advisors we cannot provide assurance that the FDA would agree that all such specific procedures are within the scope of the existing general clearance. If the FDA or any comparable regulatory authority determines that our promotion of our products for any such procedures represents promotion of an off-label use, the FDA or such regulator could request that we modify our labeling or promotional materials, or otherwise subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including warning letters, untitled letters, injunctions, seizures, civil fines, or criminal penalties. In addition, from time to time, we modify our products, including the hardware and software in the da Vinci surgical systems, after we obtain 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the devices in ways that we do not believe require new 510(k) clearance. We cannot provide assurance that the FDA would agree in all cases with our determinations not to seek new 510(k) clearance for any of these changes. If the FDA disagrees with our assessments that a new 510(k) clearance was not required prior to commercializing the devices with these changes or modifications, then the FDA could impose enforcement sanctions, require the recall of any modified products, \nTable of Contents\n\nand/or require us to obtain 510(k) clearance or other FDA marketing authorization before permitting the commercialization of any modified products, and we may be unable to obtain any such marketing authorizations in a timely manner or at all.\nWe have a wholly owned manufacturing facility located in Mexicali, Mexico, which manufactures reusable and disposable surgical instruments. This facility is registered with the FDA as well as with Mexican authorities. The facility is operated under U.S. and international quality system regulations, including those applicable to Canada, the EU, Brazil, and Japan, among others. This facility has an FDA Establishment Registration but has not been inspected by the FDA to date. If the FDA were to identify non-conformances in our product documentation or quality system compliance, it could hold indefinitely the importation of instruments at the border, which would deprive us of the ability to sell and supply the majority of our customers until the FDA requirements have been satisfied. Similar supply disruptions could occur if key suppliers outside of the U.S. were to encounter non-conformances with their documentation or quality system compliance.\nOUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO A LENGTHY AND UNCERTAIN DOMESTIC REGULATORY REVIEW PROCESS. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY DOMESTIC REGULATORY AUTHORIZATIONS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN THE U.S.\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, promotion, sales, distribution, and post-market support and medical device reporting in the U.S. to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In order for us to market products for use in the U.S., we generally must first obtain clearance from the FDA pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FFDCA or approval of the product through the PMA pathway. Clearance under Section 510(k) requires demonstration that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered (“pre-amendment”) status and for which a PMA is not required. If we develop products in the future that are not considered to be substantially equivalent to a device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered status, we may be required to obtain marketing authorization through the more burdensome PMA process or alternatively through the de novo classification process, which is a path to market for novel devices that are low to moderate risk and for which a predicate device is not available. \nAlthough our current products have generally been cleared through the 510(k) clearance process, we may decide to seek approval for future products through a PMA submission or through the de novo classification process. A PMA is typically a much more complex, lengthy, and burdensome application than a 510(k) and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA. In the PMA process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical study, manufacturing, and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices. In the de novo classification process, a manufacturer whose novel device under the FFDCA would otherwise be automatically classified as Class III and require the submission and approval of a PMA prior to marketing is able to request down-classification of the device to Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents a low or moderate risk.\nSimilarly, although the FDA has a statutory deadline of 120 days to review a de novo submission, in practice, the review may take much longer. In addition, a PMA application or de novo classification requests generally requesre the performance of one or more clinical studies. In some cases, such studies may also be required to support a 510(k) application, and any requirements to conduct clinical studies beyond those we anticipate for our current or future products could add significantly to our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FDA may not act favorably or quickly in its review of any marketing application submissions, or we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain marketing authorization from the FDA, either of which could delay or preclude the sale of new products in the U.S. In addition, the FDA may place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition of granting marketing authorization. Product applications can also be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following marketing authorization. Any delays or failure to obtain FDA marketing authorization for new or modified products that we develop, any limitations imposed by the FDA on new product use, or the costs of obtaining FDA clearance or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may change their policies, adopt additional regulations, revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. We may be found non-compliant as a result of future changes in, or interpretations of, regulations by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. For example, in February 2024, the FDA issued a final rule to amend and replace the QSR, which sets forth the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices, to align more closely with the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) standards. Specifically, this final rule, which the FDA expects to go into effect on February 2, 2026, establishes the “Quality Management System Regulation” (“QMSR”), which among other things, incorporates by reference the quality management \nTable of Contents\n\nsystem requirements of ISO 13485:2016. Although the FDA has stated that the standards contained in ISO 13485:216 are substantially similar to those set forth in the QSR, it is unclear the extent to which this final rule, once effective, could impose additional or different regulatory requirements on us that could increase the costs of compliance or otherwise negatively affect our business. If we are unable to comply with QMSR, once effective, or with any other changes in the laws or regulations enforced by FDA or comparable regulatory authorities, we may be subject to enforcement action, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAdditionally, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list of device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the recommended testing methods, where feasible. The FDA may establish performance criteria for classes of devices for which we or our competitors seek or currently have received clearance, and it is unclear the extent to which such performance standards, if established, could impact our ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances or otherwise create competition that may negatively affect our business.\nIn order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain IRB approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a “significant risk” (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an IDE application. Many of our products to date have been or would be considered significant risk devices requiring IDE approval prior to investigational use. We may not be able to obtain FDA and/or IRB approval to undertake clinical trials in the U.S. for any new devices that we intend to market in the U.S. in the future.\nEven if we obtain such approvals, we may not be able to conduct studies that comply with the IDE and other regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from any such trials may not support clearance or approval of the investigational device. Clinical testing is difficult to design and implement, can take many years, can be expensive, and carries uncertain outcomes and, if we fail to complete our planned or ongoing clinical trials or if such clinical trials produce negative or inconclusive results, we may be delayed or prevented from obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to commercialize our products for new or expanded indications. Additionally, we may experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials for any number of reasons, which could adversely affect the costs, timing, or successful completion of our clinical trials. If we fail to complete our planned and ongoing clinical trials or if such clinical trials produce negative or inconclusive results, we may be delayed or prevented from obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to commercialize our products for new or expanded indications, which may limit the market for our products.\nCertainty that clinical trials will meet desired endpoints, produce meaningful or useful data, and be free of unexpected adverse effects or that the FDA will accept the validity of foreign clinical study data cannot be assured, and such uncertainty could preclude or delay market clearance or authorizations resulting in significant financial costs and reduced revenue. Failure to obtain such approvals or to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOUR PRODUCTS MAY CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO ADVERSE MEDICAL EVENTS OR BE SUBJECT TO FAILURES OR MALFUNCTIONS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE FDA AND FOREIGN REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND, IF WE FAIL TO DO SO, WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO SANCTIONS THAT COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe are subject to the FDA’s medical device reporting regulations and similar foreign regulations, which require us to report to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities when we receive or become aware of information that reasonably suggests that one or more of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that, if the malfunction were to recur, it could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. The timing of our obligation to report is triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events of which we become aware within the prescribed time frame. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of the product. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearance, approval, or certification, seizure of our products or delay in clearance, approval, or certification of future products.\nTable of Contents\n\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in the design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA’s authority to require a recall must be based on a finding that there is reasonable probability that the device could cause serious injury or death. We may also choose to voluntarily recall a product if any material deficiency is found. A government‑mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing defects, labeling or design deficiencies, packaging defects, or other deficiencies or failures to comply with applicable regulations. Product defects or other errors may occur in the future.\nDepending on the corrective action we take to redress a product’s deficiencies or defects, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new clearances, approvals, or certifications for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such clearances, approvals, or certifications may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement actions, including FDA or foreign regulatory authorities warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. We may initiate voluntary withdrawals or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. If the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities disagree with our determinations, it could require us to report those actions as recalls, and we may be subject to enforcement actions. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to product liability claims against us, and negatively affect our sales. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, would require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES DO NOT CONTINUE TO MEET FEDERAL, STATE, OR OTHER MANUFACTURING REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TEMPORARILY CEASE ALL OR PART OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND/OR RECALL SOME PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT DELIVERY DELAYS AND LOST REVENUE.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and audit by notified bodies, and our operations will continue to be regulated and inspected by the FDA and other regulatory agencies and notified bodies for compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements contained in the QSR and other regulatory requirements. We are also required to comply with ISO quality system standards as well as EU legislation and norms in order to produce products for sale in the EU. In addition, many countries, such as Canada and Japan, have very specific additional regulatory requirements for quality assurance and manufacturing. If we fail to continue to comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, as well as ISO or other regulatory standards, we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations.\nWe continue to be subject to FDA and certain other inspections by other regulatory authorities and notified bodies at any time. Maintaining such compliance is difficult and costly. We cannot be certain that our facilities will be found to comply with Good Manufacturing Practice requirements or ISO standards and other regulatory requirements in future inspections and audits by regulatory authorities and notified bodies.\nWe are currently participating in the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”), which allows an MDSAP-recognized auditing organization to conduct a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer that evaluates our quality system to assess compliance with the requirements of multiple regulatory jurisdictions, including the U.S., Japan, Brazil, Australia, and Canada. The information collected in an MDSAP audit is shared and reviewed amongst all the regulatory authorities participating in the MDSAP, who may or may not determine that additional information or auditing is required.\nOur Sunnyvale, California facility is licensed by the State of California to manufacture medical devices. We have been subject to periodic inspections by the California Department of Health Services Food and Drug Branch and, if we are unable to maintain this license following any future inspections, we will be unable to manufacture or ship some products, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, both our Sunnyvale, California and Mexicali, Mexico facilities are subject to periodic inspections by other regulatory bodies, including third-party auditors on behalf of national regulatory authorities. Compliance with multiple regulatory standards is complex, difficult, and costly to maintain, and material deficiencies could result in significant limitations on our ability to manufacture, transport, and sell our products in one or more countries.\nTable of Contents\n\nOUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY PROCESSES AND APPROVAL OR CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE NECESSARY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.\nTo be able to sell our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals or certifications and comply with the regulations of those countries, which may differ substantially from those of the U.S. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals or certifications and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals or certifications is complex, and the time to obtain clearances or certifications in other countries varies; therefore, we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals or certifications in any other country in which we plan to market our products or obtain such approvals or certifications on a favorable schedule. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or certification in any other country in which we plan to market our products, our ability to generate revenue will be harmed. In particular, if the FDA refuses to provide CFGs, our ability to register products or renew such registrations may be delayed or denied.\nFor instance, one of the most significant changes in the regulatory landscape is in the EU; more specifically, the regulation of medical devices has evolved and may be subject to further developments in 2025. The EU Medical Devices Regulation, which repealed and replaced the EU Medical Devices Directive, became applicable on May 26, 2021. In accordance with transitional provisions, both (i) devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021, and (ii) legacy devices lawfully placed on the EU market from May 26, 2021, in accordance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation transitional provisions may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until December 31, 2028 (at the very latest and depending on the product risk classification) per the EU Medical Devices Regulation extended transitional provisions, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. However, since May 26, 2021, manufacturers must already comply with a number of new, or reinforced, requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, including registration of economic operators and of devices control plan, Periodic Safety Update Report (“PSUR”), notify body periodic vigilance report, post-market surveillance, clinical periodic review report, and vigilance requirements, such as the Post Market Clinical Follow-Up (“PMCF”) or Clinical Evaluation Plan (“CEP”).\nSubject to the transitional provisions, in order to sell our products in EU member states, our products must comply with the general safety and performance requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EU. All medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. It is the responsibility of the (manufacturer) Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (“PRRC”) to ensure such requirements are fulfilled and in place in the company. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients or the safety and health of users and, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks that may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification and may include a technical documentation assessment and an onsite audit. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts that relate to sterility, metrology, or reuse aspects), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. The notified body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design, and final inspection of our devices. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements and we have the organizational structure to support it (i.e., PRRC), the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would be unable to affix the CE mark to our products, which would prevent us from selling them within the EU or any countries recognizing the CE mark. The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.\nWe have gained certification under the EU Medical Devices Regulation and, where appropriate, maintained our certificates granted under the former EU Medical Devices Directive for all medical devices that we intend to continue to market in the EU and EEA.\nFurther, Switzerland, which is the country from which we import our products into the EU and where our EU regulatory team is based, has not yet entered into a Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU that covers the EU Medical Device Regulation and allows medical devices to move freely between Switzerland and the EU. Therefore, for future needs, we will adjust the manner in which we bring our products into the EU market. Any such adjustments could cause temporary disruptions in and have adverse financial implications to our business in Europe.\nTable of Contents\n\nIn Japan, to date, we received approvals from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for our da Vinci Si, Xi, X, and SP surgical systems and various associated instruments and accessories for use in certain da Vinci procedures. We may seek additional approvals for other products and/or indications; however, there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted. In addition, because not all of our instruments have received product approvals and reimbursement is an additional process to generate market acceptance, it is possible that procedures will be adopted slowly or not at all. Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are reimbursed by governmental health administration authorities. There are multiple pathways to obtain reimbursement for procedures including those that require in-country clinical data and which are considered for reimbursed status in April of even-numbered years. If we are not successful in obtaining the necessary reimbursement approvals or obtaining approvals for future products and procedures, then the demand for our products could be limited. These limitations could eliminate a significant market opportunity for our products in Japan.\nIn China, our capital sales are subject to importation authorizations and purchasing tender processes. In June 2023, the China National Health Commission published the 2023 Quota. Under the 2023 Quota, the government will allow for the sale of 559 new surgical robots into China, which could include da Vinci surgical systems as well as surgical systems introduced by others. As of December 31, 2024, including systems that were sold in prior quarters, we have placed 121 da Vinci surgical systems under the 2023 Quota. Our ability to track the number of systems that could be sold under these quotas in the future is limited by provincial and national agencies making such information publicly available. Future system sales and our ability to grow future procedure volumes are dependent on the completion of these purchasing tender authorizations. The timing and magnitude of these future authorizations, which may determine our system placements in future years, is not certain, and we expect to continue to experience variability in the timing of capital sales in China.\nCHANGES IN HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION AND POLICY MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIn the U.S., there have been, and continue to be, a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which made changes that have impacted and are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.\nThe ACA contained a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund health insurance coverage expansions among other things. This included a number of Medicare payment system reforms, including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians, and other providers to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models and appropriated funding for comparative effectiveness research.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive branch, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA became law. These changes included an aggregate reduction in Medicare payments, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect through 2032, unless additional Congressional action is taken, with the exception of a temporary suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022. Individual states in the U.S. have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints and discounts, and require marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures.\nWe expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our customers. Any changes to, or uncertainty with respect to, future reimbursement rates or changes in hospital admission rates could impact our customers’ demand for our products and services, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFurther, the federal, state, and local governments, Medicare, Medicaid, managed-care organizations, and foreign governments have, in the past, considered, are currently considering, and may, in the future, consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the U.S. or other countries, including retroactive and prospective rate and coverage criteria changes, competitive bidding or tender processes for certain products and services, and other changes intended to reduce expenditures along with uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether other healthcare policies, including policies stemming from legislation or regulations affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future, what effect such policies would have on our business, or what effect ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers.\nFor instance, in December 2021, the EU Regulation No. 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment, amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted. While the Regulation entered into force in January 2022, it will only begin to apply from \nTable of Contents\n\nJanuary 2028 onwards, with preparatory and implementation-related steps to take place in the interim. Once applicable, it will have a phased implementation depending on the concerned products. This Regulation intends to boost cooperation among EU member states in assessing health technologies, including certain high-risk medical devices, and provide the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. It will permit EU member states to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the highest potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU member states will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical, etc.) aspects of health technology and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE, AND FOREIGN LAWS GOVERNING OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES, WHICH, IF VIOLATED, COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL PENALTIES. ADDITIONALLY, CHALLENGES TO, OR INVESTIGATION INTO, OUR PRACTICES COULD CAUSE ADVERSE PUBLICITY AND BE COSTLY TO RESPOND TO AND, THUS, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires us to track and disclose the source of any tantalum, tin, gold, and tungsten used in manufacturing that may originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining regions (so called “conflict minerals”). These metals are central to the technology industry and are present in some of our products as component parts. In most cases, no acceptable alternative material exists that has the necessary properties that our products require. Because it is not possible to determine the source of the metals by analysis, we must obtain a good faith description of the source of the intermediate components and raw materials from parties in our supply chain. The components that incorporate those metals may originate from many sources, and we purchase fabricated products from manufacturers who may have a long and difficult-to-trace supply chain. As the spot price of these materials varies, producers of the metal intermediates can be expected to change the mix of sources used. Accordingly, components and assemblies we buy may have a mix of sources as their origin. We are required to carry out a diligent effort to determine and disclose the source of these materials. There can be no assurance that we can obtain this information accurately or reliably, or at all, from intermediate producers who may be unwilling or unable to provide this information or further identify their sources of supply or to notify us if these sources change. In addition, these metals are subject to price fluctuations and shortages that can affect our ability to obtain the manufactured materials that we rely on at favorable terms or from consistent sources. These changes could have an adverse impact on our ability to manufacture and market our devices and products.\nWe are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the payment of remuneration to induce or reward hospitals, physicians, or other healthcare professionals either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease, or order of healthcare products or services for which payment may be made under the federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payor programs. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Similar laws must be complied with at the state level and in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe must comply with the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent. Although we do not submit claims directly to government payors, manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which created additional federal criminal statutes prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.\nThese laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements that we may have with hospitals, physicians, or other potential purchasers of our products. They particularly impact how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, speaker, education, and training programs, physician consulting, and other service arrangements. These laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied to specific circumstances. Violating anti-kickback laws and false claims laws can result in civil and criminal fines and penalties, which can be substantial and include monetary damages and penalties, \nTable of Contents\n\nimprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to defend and, thus, could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe federal Physicians Payments Sunshine Act imposes reporting and disclosure requirements on certain device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians (including family members), as defined by statute, certain non-physician practitioners, including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals. Such information must be made publicly available in a searchable format. In addition, device manufacturers are required to report and disclose any ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, as well as any transfers of value made to such physician owners and investors, during the preceding calendar year. Similar requirements apply in foreign jurisdictions. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers are required to submit reports to CMS by the 90th day of each calendar year.\nMany states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Certain states mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices, and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to physicians or marketing expenditures and pricing information. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may be found out of compliance with one or more of the requirements, subjecting us to significant civil monetary penalties.\nAdditionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.\nCompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our OUS operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties in the U.S. and/or abroad. These numerous, and sometimes conflicting, laws and regulations include U.S. laws, such as the FCPA, and similar laws in other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nOur operations are subject to certain antitrust and competition laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, in particular the U.S. and the EU. These laws prohibit, among other things, anticompetitive agreements and practices. If any of our commercial agreements or practices are found to violate or infringe such laws, we may be subject to civil and other penalties. We may also be subject to third-party claims for damages. Further, agreements that infringe upon these antitrust and competition laws may be void and unenforceable, in whole or in part, or require modification in order to be lawful and enforceable. If we are unable to enforce our commercial agreements, whether at all or in material part, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and government investigations involving labor and employment. Such claims, lawsuits, and government investigations are inherently uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nWe are also exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, manufacturers, suppliers, and any other third parties that we may engage in connection with the development and commercialization of our products may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless, and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) the laws of the FDA and other similar regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete, and accurate information to such authorities; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) data privacy, security, fraud, and abuse laws and regulations; or (iv) laws that require the true, complete, and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or the creation of fraudulent data in clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations.\nAdditionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business or results of operations, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, other U.S. federal healthcare programs, or healthcare programs in other jurisdictions, integrity oversight \nTable of Contents\n\nand reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations.\nIF HOSPITALS AND OTHER SURGICAL FACILITIES DO NOT CONTINUE TO MEET FEDERAL, STATE, OR OTHER REGULATORY STANDARDS, THEY MAY BE REQUIRED TO TEMPORARILY CEASE ALL OR PART OF THEIR SYSTEM UTILIZATION.\nOur global customers are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities. Our customers are required to comply with applicable regulations, including with respect to the reprocessing of our instruments and accessories. Hospitals may not follow cleaning and sterilization instructions properly, or equipment used for cleaning and sterilization may malfunction or be used improperly. If our customers deviate from cleaning and sterilization instructions, regulatory authorities may require them to suspend the use of our systems.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO FULLY PROTECT AND SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM USE BY THIRD PARTIES, OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET MAY BE HARMED.\nOur commercial success depends in part on obtaining patent protection for the proprietary technologies contained in our products and on successfully defending our patents against infringing products and/or services in litigation or administrative proceedings, including patent oppositions, reviews, or reexaminations. We incur substantial costs in obtaining patents and, if necessary, defending our patent rights. We do not know whether we will be successful in obtaining the desired patent protection for our new proprietary technologies or that the protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable when challenged. The success of defending our proprietary rights can be highly uncertain, because it involves complex and often evolving legal issues and procedures that are dependent on the particular facts of each case.\nIn addition to patents, we also rely on other intellectual property rights, such as trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws to protect proprietary technologies. We further utilize nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions as well as technical measures to protect our proprietary technologies. Nevertheless, these measures may be inadequate in protecting our technologies. If these measures prove to be inadequate in protecting our technologies, our competitive advantages may be reduced. Moreover, we may not have adequate remedies for potential breaches by employees, consultants, and others who participate in developing our proprietary technologies against their agreements with us regarding intellectual property. As a result, our trade secrets may be lost. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal to or superior to our technologies without infringing any of our intellectual property, which would harm our ability to compete in the market.\nAs foreign markets become more significant in revenue for us, our foreign operations and strategic alliances with foreign entities will likely increase. Our exposure to risks associated with these operations requires us to increase our reliance on protecting our intellectual property against infringing products and/or services in markets outside of the U.S. The laws and judicial systems in these countries may introduce yet another level of uncertainty in our effort to obtain the desired protection as well as defending our rights.\nOTHERS MAY BE SUCCESSFUL IN ASSERTING THAT OUR PRODUCTS INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES AND/OR ENJOIN US FROM COMMERCIALIZING OUR PRODUCTS.\nAs we continue to introduce and commercialize new products and technologies, there may be U.S. and foreign patents issued to third parties that relate to our products. Some of these patents may be broad enough to cover one or more aspects of our products. We do not know whether any of these patents, if challenged, would be held valid, enforceable, and infringed. From time to time, we receive, and likely will continue to receive, letters from third parties accusing us of infringing and/or inviting us to license their patents. We may be sued by, or become involved in an administrative proceeding with, one or more of these third parties.\nWe cannot be certain that a court or administrative body would agree with any arguments or defenses that we may have concerning invalidity, unenforceability, or non-infringement of any third-party patent. In addition, other parties may have filed or will file patent applications covering products that are similar to or identical to ours. We cannot be certain that patents issuing from our own patent applications covering our products will have a priority date over any patents issuing from applications filed by a third party.\nThe medical device industry has experienced extensive intellectual property litigation and administrative proceedings. If third parties assert infringement claims or institute administrative proceedings against us, our technical and management personnel will need to spend significant time and effort, and we will incur large expenses in defending against these attacks. We cannot be certain that we will prevail in defending against infringement, validity, or enforceability claims against us. If \nTable of Contents\n\nplaintiffs in patent administrative proceedings are successful, our patent portfolio may be adversely affected. If plaintiffs in any patent action are successful, we may be enjoined from selling or importing our products, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, or we may be required to obtain a license that requires us to pay substantial royalties or relocate our manufacturing facilities. In addition, any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline.\nOUR PRODUCTS MAY RELY ON LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF WE LOSE ACCESS TO THESE TECHNOLOGIES, OUR REVENUES COULD DECLINE.\nOur products may rely on technology that we license from others, including technology that is integral to our products. There is no assurance that we can obtain or retain licenses on acceptable terms or at all. The license agreements we have entered into with several industry partners may be terminated for breach. If any of these agreements are terminated, we may be unable to reacquire the necessary license on satisfactory terms or at all. The failure to obtain, retain, or maintain licenses could prevent or delay further development or commercialization of our products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE BELOW EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.\nDue to the nascent nature of our industry, we have limited insight into trends that may emerge in our market and affect our business. The revenue and income potential of our market are unproven, and we may be unable to maintain or grow our revenue or income. Our products typically have lengthy sales cycles. In addition, our costs may be higher than we anticipated. If we fail to generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Further, future revenue from sales of our products is difficult to forecast, because the market for new surgical technologies is still evolving. Our results of operations could be impacted by numerous factors, including:\n•the extent to which our products achieve and maintain market acceptance;\n•actions relating to regulatory matters;\n•product quality and supply problems;\n•inflationary pressures on the cost of producing and distributing our products;\n•our timing and ability to develop our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities;\n•demand for our products;\n•the utilization of our systems placed under usage-based operating lease arrangements;\n•the size and timing of particular sales and any collection delays related to those sales;\n•the progress of surgical training in the use of our products;\n•our ability to develop, introduce, and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis;\n•third-party payor reimbursement policies;\n•our ability to protect our proprietary rights and defend against third-party challenges;\n•our ability to license additional intellectual property rights; and\n•the progress and results of any clinical trials.\nOur operating results in any particular period will not be a reliable indication of our future performance. It is possible that, in future periods, our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock and the value of your investment will likely decline.\nOUR STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN, AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE, VOLATILE.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and may fluctuate significantly in the future. For example, during 2022, the adjusted closing price of our common stock reached a high of $360.00 and a low of $183.06; during 2023, it reached a high of $354.93 and a low of $224.75; and, during 2024, it reached a high of $550.62 and a low of $322.13. Our stock price can fluctuate for a number of reasons, including:\n•announcements about us or our competitors;\n•variations in our operating results and financial guidance;\n•our introduction or abandonment of new technologies or products;\n•regulatory approvals and enforcement actions;\n•changes in our product pricing policies;\nTable of Contents\n\n•changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts;\n•economic changes and overall market volatility;\n•announcements relating to product quality and the supply chain for our products;\n•litigation;\n•media coverage, whether accurate or inaccurate, fair or misleading;\n•political uncertainties;\n•short sales on shares of our common stock or other activities by short sellers; and\n•our stock repurchase program.\nFuture stock repurchase programs will be contingent on a variety of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, and business requirements. There can be no assurance that we will continue repurchasing our common stock in the future, consistent with historical levels or at all, or that our stock repurchase programs will have a beneficial impact on our stock price.\nIn addition, stock markets generally have experienced, and in the future may experience, significant price and volume volatility. This volatility has a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies. Further, the securities of many medical device companies, including us, have historically been subject to extensive price and volume fluctuations that may affect the market price of their common stock. If these broad market fluctuations continue, it may have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nCHANGES TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS MAY AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nA change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing standards or the reevaluation of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.",
