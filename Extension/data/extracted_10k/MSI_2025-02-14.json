      "text": "Item 1: Business\nOverview | Solving for safer\nMotorola Solutions' business is safety and security. Every day we work to deliver on our commitment of helping to create safer communities, safer schools, safer hospitals and safer businesses. Our work as a global leader in public safety and enterprise security is grounded in nearly 100 years of close customer and community collaboration. We design and advance technology for more than 100,000 public safety and enterprise customers in over 100 countries, driven by our commitment to help make everywhere safer for all.\nWe are building and connecting an ecosystem of safety and security technologies to help protect people, property and places, which includes Land Mobile Radio Communications (\"LMR\" or \"LMR Communications\"), Video Security and Access Control (\"Video\") and Command Center. Across all three technologies, we offer on-premises, cloud-based and hybrid software solutions, and services such as cybersecurity subscription services and managed and support services.\nWe support police, fire and other emergency responders to help protect communities, while our base of enterprise customers, including schools, hospitals, businesses and stadiums, continues to grow as the criticality of safety and security becomes increasingly important. As a provider to both public safety and enterprises, our technologies can connect those in need with those who can help, enabling the collaboration that is critical for a more proactive approach to safety and security. \nWe are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware as the successor to an Illinois corporation, Motorola, Inc., organized in 1928. We changed our name from Motorola, Inc. to Motorola Solutions, Inc. on January 4, 2011. Our principal executive offices are located at 500 W. Monroe St., Chicago, Illinois 60661.\nBusiness Organization\nWe manage our business organizationally through two segments: “Products and Systems Integration” and “Software and Services.” Within these segments, we have three principal product lines in which we report net sales:\n•LMR Communications: Infrastructure, devices (two-way radio and broadband, including both for public safety and professional and commercial radio (\"PCR\")) and software that enable communications, inclusive of installation and integration, backed by services, to assure availability, security and resiliency; \n•Video: Cameras (fixed, body-worn, in-vehicle), access control, sensors, infrastructure, video management, software and artificial intelligence (\"AI\")-powered analytics that help enable visibility and bring attention to what’s important; and\n•Command Center: Command center solutions and software applications that unify voice, video, data and analytics from public safety agencies, enterprises and the community to create a broad informational view to help simplify workflows and improve the accuracy and speed of decisions. \nThe Company has invested across these three technologies organically and through acquisitions to evolve its LMR focus and expand its safety and security products and services.\nOur strategy is to generate value through our technologies that help meet the changing needs of our customers around the world in protecting people, property and places. While each technology individually strives to make users safer and more productive, we believe we can enable better outcomes for our customers when we unite these technologies to work together. Our goal is to help remove silos and barriers between people and technologies, so that data unifies, information flows, operations run and collaboration improves to help strengthen safety and security everywhere. One example of this collaboration is highlighted by a school setting. When a teacher presses a panic button on a phone, this can automatically notify local law enforcement of an emergency, trigger a lockdown to secure all entries, share live video feeds with first responders and send mass notifications to key stakeholders inside and outside the school, helping schools to detect, respond and resolve safety and security threats.\nThe principal products within each segment, by technology, are described below:\nProducts and Systems Integration Segment\nIn 2024, the segment’s net sales were $6.9 billion, representing 64% of our consolidated net sales.    \nLMR Communications\nOur LMR Communications technology includes infrastructure and devices for LMR, as well as devices for public safety Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) and public carrier LTE. Our technology enables voice and multimedia collaborations across two-way radio, WiFi and public and private broadband networks. We are a global leader in the two-way radio category, including Project 25 (P25), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (“TETRA”) and Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), as well as other PCR solutions. We also deliver LTE solutions for public safety, government and commercial users, including devices operating in both low-band and mid-band frequencies, including Citizens’ Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) frequencies. We also offer High Frequency (HF) and Very High Frequency (VHF) communications technology to military, government and relief agency customers who require dynamic and mobile point-to-point voice communications in remote environments without the need for fixed infrastructure.\n We believe that public safety agencies and enterprises continue to trust LMR communications systems and devices because they are purpose-built and designed for reliability, availability, security and resiliency to help keep people connected even during the most challenging conditions. \nBy extending our two-way radios with broadband data capabilities, we strive to provide our customers with greater functionality and multimedia access to the information and data they need in their workflows. Examples include application services such as GPS location to better protect lone workers, job dispatch to assign tasks and work orders and over-the-air programming to optimize device uptime. Our view is that complementary data applications such as these enable government, public safety and enterprise customers to work more efficiently and safely, while maintaining their mission-critical voice communications to remain connected and working in collaboration with others.\nPrimary sources of revenue for this technology come from selling devices and building communications systems, including the installation and integration of our infrastructure equipment within our customers’ technology environments. The LMR technology within the Products and Systems Integration segment represented 83% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nVideo\nOur Video technology includes video management infrastructure, AI-powered security cameras including fixed and certain mobile video equipment, as well as on-premises and cloud-based access control solutions. We deploy video security and access control solutions to thousands of government and enterprise customers around the world, including schools, transportation systems, healthcare centers, public venues, commercial real estate, utilities, prisons, factories, casinos, airports, financial institutions, government facilities, state and local law enforcement agencies and retailers. Organizations such as these utilize video security and access control to verify critical events or incidents in real-time and to provide data to investigate an event or incident after it happens.\nOur view is that government and public safety customers are increasingly turning to video security technologies, including fixed and mobile cameras, to increase visibility, accountability and safety for communities and first responders alike. \nThe Video technology within the Products and Systems Integration segment represented 17% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nSoftware and Services Segment\nIn 2024, the segment’s net sales were $3.9 billion, representing 36% of our consolidated net sales.\nLMR Communications\nLMR Communications services include support and managed services, which offer a broad continuum of support for our customers. Support services include repair and replacement, technical support and preventative maintenance, and more advanced offerings such as system monitoring, software updates and cybersecurity services. Managed services range from partial to full operational support of customer-owned or Motorola Solutions-owned communications systems. Our customers’ systems often have multi-year or multi-decade lifespans that help drive demand for software upgrades, device and infrastructure refresh opportunities, as well as additional services to monitor, manage, maintain and secure these complex networks and solutions. We strive to deliver services to our customers that help improve performance across their systems, devices and applications for greater safety and productivity.\nGiven the mission-critical nature of our customers’ operational environments, we aim to design the LMR networks they rely on for availability, security and resiliency. We have a comprehensive approach to system upgrades that addresses hardware, software and implementation services. As new system releases become available, we work with our customers to upgrade software, hardware, or both, with respect to site controllers, comparators, routers, LAN switches, servers, dispatch consoles, logging equipment, network management terminals, network security devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection sensors, on-site or remotely.\nThe LMR technology within the Software and Services segment represented 60% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nVideo\nVideo software includes video network management software, decision management and digital evidence management software, certain mobile video equipment and advanced vehicle location data analysis software, including license plate recognition. Our software is designed to complement video hardware systems, providing end-to-end video security to help keep people, property and places safe. \nOur video network management software is embedded with AI-powered analytics to deliver operational insights to our customers by bringing attention to important events within their video footage. Given the growing volume of video content, we believe that analytics are critical to delivering meaningful, action-oriented insights. Our view is that these insights can help to proactively detect an important event in real time as well as reactively search video content to detect an important event that occurred in the past. For example, AI-powered analytics can highlight a person at a facility out of hours (unusual activity), locate a missing child at a theme park (appearance search), flag a vehicle of interest at a school (license plate recognition), send an alert if doors to a restricted area are propped open at a hospital (access control), or trigger a school's customized lockdown plan while simultaneously alerting first responders and sharing video footage from inside the school.\nOur cloud technologies can offer organizations the ability to access, search and manage their video security, intrusion and access control system from a centralized dashboard, accessible on remote devices such as smartphones and laptops. Additionally, our on-premises fixed video systems can be connected to the cloud, providing our customers with the ability to securely access and manage video across their sites from a remote or central monitoring location. We believe that governments, public safety agencies and enterprises are increasingly turning to scalable, cloud-based multi-factor authentication access control to make their facilities more secure. \nOur Video services include our \"video-as-a-service\" subscription-based offerings for law enforcement, simplifying procurement by bundling hardware and software into a single subscription. For example, body cameras and in-car video systems can be paired with either on-premises or cloud-based digital evidence management software and complementary command center products. Our cloud solutions are also sold as-a-service, available as single-year to multi-year hosted services, supporting our customers with upgrades and software enhancements to help ensure system performance and technological advancement.\nThe Video technology within the Software and Services segment represented 20% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nCommand Center\nOur Command Center portfolio consists of cloud-native, on-premises and hybrid software solutions that support the complex process of the public safety workflow from \"911 call to case closure.\" From the moment a person contacts 911, an array of individuals engage to gather information, coordinate a response and manage the incident to resolution. These individuals include call takers who answer and triage 911 calls; dispatchers who route calls to police, fire and emergency medical services to manage the response; first responders who support on scene; intelligence analysts who support the incident; records and evidence specialists who preserve information and evidence; detectives who manage cases; crime analysts who identify patterns and accelerate investigations; and corrections officers who oversee jail and inmate management. \nTo help ensure that individuals within the public safety workflow can work as efficiently, effectively and safely as possible, we believe it’s important that individuals within enterprises and communities can communicate and collaborate directly with public safety agencies, particularly during emergencies. Our Command Center portfolio offers solutions that are designed to help community members, enterprises and public safety agencies work together and share information in an effort to help prevent critical events from escalating and better inform an emergency response when an incident unfolds.\nOur Command Center software is designed to support an emergency response. In the 911 communications center, we offer call-taking and management software (including multimedia communication capabilities and AI-powered call transcription and language translation), and voice and computer-aided dispatch software to assign first responders to incidents. For emergency management teams, we offer mass notification and alerting (including panic button mobile applications), and incident collaboration software that aids in coordinating a multi-disciplinary response. In the field, we offer mobile applications that help first responders to collaborate with each other, remain connected to the information they need, manage an incident, capture critical information to support investigations, and remotely file reports. For information and support services teams, we offer integrated records and evidence management software, as well as solutions for managing tips and publishing crime maps to aid community engagement. For intelligence and investigations teams, we offer software that can unify voice, video and data in order to increase situational awareness from a single map-based view during a real-time incident response, and investigative tools to help uncover connections across records to generate leads and help close cases. For enterprises, we provide incident management and business resilience solutions that help secure people and facilities, as well as share information with public safety when an incident necessitates it.\nAnother area of public safety evolution is the increasing adoption of Next Generation 911 Core Services (“NGCS”), a group of products and services needed to create infrastructure connectivity in order to process a 911 call using Next Generation (“NG”) technology. The NG infrastructure is an Emergency Service IP Network (\"ESInet\"), which can carry voice, data and multimedia. ESInet enables 911 call takers at public safety answering points to respond to text, video and data. Our NGCS can be offered as a managed service and includes call routing, ESInet, location services, geographic information services, cybersecurity and our continuous communications network and security operations center dedicated to public safety. \nCommand Center also includes interoperability solutions that provide connectivity across LMR and broadband networks to help ensure that communication is not limited by coverage area, network technology or device type. Additionally, Command Center includes push-to-talk (\"PTT\") devices that deliver voice communications over LTE and Wi-Fi, and advanced back-end systems that enable and manage interoperable communications, capable of scaling from small enterprises to nationwide cellular networks. For example, a two-way radio network can connect with an LTE network, assisting individuals in communicating securely and more easily across technologies. These solutions can provide our public safety customers with the critical interoperability between multiple agencies' networks, facilitating a coordinated response.\nFinally, as the Command Center market continues to evolve from on-premises to hybrid and cloud technologies to improve their operations, we offer both cloud-native applications and cloud features that enhance on-premises applications. We believe this flexibility helps our customers to optimize their investments and enhance their systems with the technologies of their choice. \n The Command Center technology within the Software and Services segment represented 20% of the net sales of the total segment in 2024.\nOur Customers and Contracts\nWe serve government agencies, state and local public safety agencies, as well as commercial and industrial customers. Our customer base is fragmented and widespread when considering the many levels of government, public safety agency and private sector decision-makers that procure and use our products and services. Serving this global customer base spanning federal, state, county, province, territory, municipal, and departmental independent bodies, along with our enterprise and industrial customers, requires a significant go-to-market investment.\nOur sales model includes both direct sales by our in-house sales force, which tends to focus on our largest accounts, and sales through our channel partner program. Our trained channel partners include independent dealers, distributors and software vendors around the world. The dealers and distributors each have their own sales organizations that complement and extend the reach of our sales force. The independent software vendors offer customized applications that meet the specific needs of the customers we serve.\nOur largest customer is the U.S. government (through multiple contracts with its various branches and agencies, including the armed services) representing approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales in 2024. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings over several quarters as many of our contracts with the U.S. government are long-term in nature. All contracts with the U.S. government, and certain other government agencies within the U.S., are subject to cancellation at the customer’s convenience. For a discussion of risks related to these contracts and customer relationships, please refer to “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.\nPayment terms with our customers vary worldwide. Generally, contractual payment terms range from 30 to 45 days from the invoice date within North America and typically do not exceed 90 days from the invoice date in regions outside of North America. A portion of our contracts include implementation milestones, such as delivery, installation, and system acceptance, which generally take six months to two years to complete. Invoicing the customer is typically dependent on completion of the milestones. We generally do not grant extended payment terms. As required for competitive reasons, we may provide long-term financing in connection with equipment purchases. Financing may cover all or a portion of the purchase price. Refer to “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks related to requests by customers to provide vendor financing.\nGenerally, our contracts do not include a right of return, other than for standard warranty provisions. Due to customer purchasing patterns and the cyclical nature of the markets we serve, our sales historically have tended to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter being the highest.\nCompetition\nWe operate in highly competitive markets that are sensitive to technological advances. Competitive factors in these markets include product quality and reliability, technological capabilities, cost-effectiveness and industry experience. In operating in these competitive markets, we have broadened how we work with our customers, expanding from our global LMR technology platform to include an integrated suite of physical security solutions via our Video and Command Center capabilities. The interplay of technologies, guided by our deep knowledge of public safety and enterprise workflows, delivers customers one connected system to unify their critical communications, video security, access control, data, and analytics streams.\nWe experience widespread competition from a growing number of existing and new competitors.\nOur major competitors within our LMR, Video and Command Center technologies include the following companies:\n\nTechnology           Competitor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \nLMR                  Airbus, BK Technologies, Hytera, iCOM, JVCKenwood Corporation, L3Harris Technologies, RCA, Samsung, Sepura, Tait, Zebra                                                                                                                                           \nVideo                Allegion, Assa Abloy, Axis Communications, Axon Enterprise, Bosch, Brivo, Dahua Technology Company, dormakaba, Eagle Eye Networks, Flock, Genetec, Hanwha Group, Hikvision, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Milestone Systems, Rhombus, Spectrum Brands, Verkada     \nCommand Center       AlertMedia, Axon Enterprise, Carbyne, CentralSquare Technologies, Comtech Telecommunications, Everbridge, Hexagon, Intrado, Mark43, NICE Public Safety, Onsolve, Oracle Public Safety, Tyler Technologies, Versaterm                                              \nOther Information\nBacklog\nOur backlog includes orders that have been received and are believed to be firm. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our backlog was as follows:\n\n                                                                     December 31\n(In millions)                                   2024   2023                     \nProducts and Systems Integration          $4,135                      $4,993    \nSoftware and Services                     10,562                       9,266    \n                                         $14,697                     $14,259    \nApproximately 57% of the Products and Systems Integration segment backlog and 24% of the Software and Services segment backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2025. The firmness of such orders is subject to future events that may cause the amount recognized to change. In 2023, our backlog in the Software and Services segment for Airwave services contracted with the Home Office through December 31, 2026 was reduced by $777 million to align with the legal order imposed by the Competition and Markets Authority (\"CMA\") which implemented a prospective price control on Airwave (the \"Charge Control\"). In 2024, as a result of the Home Office's notice of a contract extension (the \"Deferred National Shutdown Notice\"), we recorded additional backlog of $748 million to reflect an incremental three years of services extending through December 31, 2029. Subsequently, we filed an action with the U.K. High Court challenging the Deferred National Shutdown Notice as being in breach of U.K. procurement and public law. The trial in this matter is currently set to commence on April 22, 2025. The backlog related to the incremental years of service contemplated in the Deferred National Shutdown Notice could change depending on the outcome of proceedings. Refer to \"Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Airwave contract with the U.K.\nRecent Acquisitions\n\nSegment

compensation of $7 million              March 3, 2022\nResearch and Development\nWe prioritize investments in research and development (\"R&D\") to expand and improve our products through both new product introductions and continuous enhancements to our core products. Our R&D programs are focused on the development of LMR Communications, Video and Command Center.\nR&D expenditures were $917 million in 2024, $858 million in 2023 and $779 million in 2022. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 9,000 employees engaged in R&D activities. In addition, we engage in R&D activities with joint development and manufacturing partners and outsource certain activities to engineering firms to further supplement our internal spend. \nIntellectual Property Matters\nPatent protection is an important aspect of our operations. We have a portfolio of U.S. and foreign utility and design patents relating to our products, systems and technologies, including developments in radio frequency technology and circuits, wireless network technologies, over-the-air protocols, mission-critical communications, software and services, video security and access control, and next-generation enterprise and public safety. Each year, we also file new patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices.\nWe license some of our patents to third-parties, but licensing is not a significant source of revenue for our business. We are also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. Royalty and licensing fees vary from year to year and are subject to the terms of the agreements and sales volumes of the products subject to the license. Motorola Solutions has a royalty-free license under all of the patents and patent applications assigned to Motorola Mobility at the time of the separation of the two businesses in 2011.\nWe actively participate in the development of standards for interoperable systems. Our patents are used in standards in which our products and services are based. We offer standards-based licenses to those patents on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.\nWe believe that our patent portfolio will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage in our core product areas as well as provide leverage in the development of future technologies. While we are not dependent upon a single patent or even a few patents, we do have patents that protect features and functionality of our products and services. While these patents are important, our success also depends upon our extensive know-how, innovative culture, technological leadership and distribution channels. We do not rely solely on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish our market position; however, we will enforce our intellectual property rights when it is necessary to protect our innovation, or in some cases where attempts to negotiate mutually-agreeable licenses are not successful.\nWe seek to obtain patents, copyright registrations, and trademark registrations to protect our proprietary positions whenever possible and wherever practical. As of December 31, 2024, we owned approximately 6,485 granted patents in the U.S. and foreign countries and had approximately 725 U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Foreign patents and patent applications are mostly counterparts of our U.S. patents. During 2024, we were granted approximately 265 patents in the U.S. and in foreign countries.\nWe no longer own certain logos and other trademarks, trade names and service marks, including MOTOROLA, MOTO, MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS and the Stylized M logo and all derivatives thereof (“Motorola Marks”) and, since 2010, we have licensed the Motorola Marks from Motorola Trademark Holdings, LLC. which is currently owned by Motorola Mobility. For a description of the risks we face related to intellectual property, refer to “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nInventory and Raw Materials\nOur practice is to carry inventory levels to meet customers' delivery requirements. We provide custom products that require the stocking of inventories and a large variety of piece parts and replacement parts in order to meet delivery and warranty requirements. To the extent supplier product life cycles are shorter than ours, stocking of lifetime buy inventories may be required to meet long-term warranty and contractual requirements. In addition, replacement parts are stocked for delivery on customer demand within a short delivery cycle.\nWe currently procure certain materials and components from single-source vendors. A material disruption from a single-source vendor may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If certain single-source suppliers were to become capacity-constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or an increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact our financial results. In addition, we import materials and components that are subject to import duties. As of December 31, 2024, the duties and tariffs we are subject to did not have a significant impact on our financial results.\nWe engage with global contract manufacturers who manufacture the majority of our products, across a diverse network of manufacturing locations worldwide, including facilities for our products in Mexico, Malaysia and Canada. We also manufacture, assemble, customize, stage and integrate products in the U.S.\nLabor is generally available in reasonable proximity to our manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our largest outsourced manufacturing suppliers. As needed, we may subcontract work to other companies to fulfill customer needs in geographical areas that we do not have coverage for or for additional services that we do not provide. \nNatural gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the primary sources of energy for our manufacturing operations. In addition, other rare earth materials are components used within our semiconductor manufacturing operations. Each of these resources is currently in adequate supply for our operations. The cost to operate our facilities and freight costs are dependent on world oil prices and external third-party logistics rates for inbound and outbound air lanes. Difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned resources, or significant cost increases, could affect our financial results. \nFor a description of risks related to our supply chain, our utilization of third-parties to manufacture our products, and our use of the services of subcontractors, refer to \"Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors: of this Form 10-K.\nGovernment Regulations\nEnvironment, Worker Health and Safety & Climate Regulations\nSome of our operations, both ongoing and discontinued, are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment and worker health and safety, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the ground, air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as well as relating to the protection of the environment. Certain products of ours are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in products. \nCertain aspects of our operations and supply chain have become, and are expected to become, increasingly subject to federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and international treaties and industry standards relating to climate change and other environmental and social impacts, risks and opportunities. For example, in the European Union (the \"EU\"), the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and EU taxonomy initiatives will introduce, in staggered timelines, additional due diligence and disclosure requirements addressing sustainability that will apply to us in the coming years.\nRadio Spectrum Regulations\nRadio spectrum is required to provide wireless voice, data and video communications services. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other countries and limited spectrum is allocated to wireless services, including commercial and public safety users. We manufacture and market products and provide services in spectrum bands already allocated by regulatory bodies. These include voice and data infrastructure, mobile radios and portable or hand-held devices. Consequently, our results could be negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted by regulatory agencies. Our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum. The availability of additional radio spectrum may provide new business opportunities. Conversely, the loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands (e.g., the sharing of previously dedicated or other spectrum) may require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed. Based on growing demands for broadband, regulators continue to consider repurposing narrowband spectrum to broadband. \nTelecommunications Regulations\nCertain of our offerings include telecommunications or other communications services that are or may be subject to regulation in various federal, state, and international jurisdictions. For example, we are a provider of selective routing services for 911 calls in the US, which subjects us to various regulations, including those for 911 service reliability. As another example, we provide WAVE PTX push-to-talk offerings with and without telecommunications connectivity in various countries internationally. Additional types of regulations applicable to our offerings that include telecommunications or other communications services may include certification or licensing requirements, cybersecurity and incident reporting obligations, and regulatory fee requirements. If we do not comply with applicable rules and regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, and restrictions on our ability to operate or offer certain of our services.\nArtificial Intelligence and Biometrics Regulations\nThe U.S. federal government and many state and local governments have adopted or are considering laws or regulations governing the use of AI and biometrics, including facial recognition and license plate recognition technology, which in some instances cover certain products and services we offer. Similar laws and regulations are being enacted or considered in some jurisdictions outside the U.S., including the EU. Such regulation could impact a number of our products, including video security products that include AI technology.\nCompliance with the laws currently in effect described above did not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in 2022, 2023 and 2024. For a description of the risks we face related to these and other regulatory matters, refer to “Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe have a \"people first\" philosophy. Our employees are our driving force, drawn from all segments of our global society to make a difference for our customers. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 21,000 people globally with 51% in the North America region and 49% in the International region. Of our total global employees, 40% were employed in engineering. \nOur goal is to foster a workplace where our employees feel that their unique perspectives, cultures and abilities contribute to their personal success, as well as our Company’s success. We believe the next big idea can come from anyone, anywhere, at any time. We offer structured mentorship and rotational programs and invest in employees’ development and training, enabling them to network, develop and grow their skills to influence the future of public safety and enterprise security. Employees also have access to a wide variety of technical, functional and professional skills learning resources, including virtual, self-directed courses and on-the-job learning opportunities. \nWe strive for business growth by creating a supportive, equitable and inclusive environment where employees feel engaged, connected to our business and invested in the collective success of our customers and communities. Our human resources team works with leaders within each business function to perform annual talent reviews to assess the performance of every team member and identify development opportunities, which complement our additional specialized training for such leaders to use our corporate values to guide behaviors and lead teams. This comprehensive process fosters growth across our Company by focusing on our high-potential talent and the rigor of succession plan development for our most critical roles. \nAs part of our compensation philosophy, we strive to offer and maintain market-competitive wages, incentives and benefits for our employees to attract and retain talent, and we review our rewards programs each year in an effort to ensure they are competitive with local market practices in the industries and countries where we operate. More specifically, our total rewards package for our global employees includes broad-based stock grants and bonuses, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare, wellness and retirement benefits, paid parental and family leave, commuter benefits, paid time off (including flexible time off for U.S. exempt employees), flexible work options and other assistance and support for employees going through life-changing events.\nWe are committed to fostering a culture where all of our employees can thrive, our customers and communities are supported, and our partners recognize and share in our values. We invest in a broad spectrum of programs each year to support all employees globally, including our business councils that are open to all employees to enable networking and engagement across the company. We continued to see high levels of employee participation in 2024.\nThe safety of our employees remains a priority, and we continuously strive to provide a safe and injury-free workplace, using our global environmental, health and safety management system to ensure program and reporting consistency at all of our sites. Our general approach includes assessing risks and identifying controls through the use of our comprehensive job hazard and risk assessment tool.\nAdditional information regarding how our purpose and ethics inform our approach to corporate responsibility can be found in our Corporate Responsibility Report, which is available on our website.

      "text": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to our other filings with the SEC and the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” section in Part II. Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements in Part II. Item 8. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. These risks may be amplified by the effects of macroeconomic events or developments. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation or the trading price of our common stock. \nRisks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our Business\nAs we introduce new products and services and enhance existing products and services in our segments, we may face increased areas of risk related to the success of such products and services that we may not be able to properly assess or mitigate, as well as increased competition and additional compliance obligations, each of which could harm our reputation, market share, results of operations and financial condition or result in additional obligations or liabilities for our business.\nThe markets for certain products and services of ours are characterized by evolving technologies, industry standards and customer preferences. For example, the software and video security industries are characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences in favor of cloud solutions and the adoption of AI capabilities. In some cases, it is unclear what specific technology will be adopted in the market or what delivery model will prevail. As another example, there are long standing initiatives by governments in several countries to transition public safety communications away from LMR networks onto public mobile broadband networks. While such initiatives have gained little traction to date, if customers conclude that public mobile broadband networks, potentially augmented with emerging technologies, provide adequate resiliency, coverage, control, and cost for their critical communication needs, it could adversely affect our LMR Communications sales. The process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services to meet such evolving technologies, industry standards and customer preferences is complex, costly and uncertain. Any failure by us to effectively, timely, and frequently introduce new products and services or enhance current products and services, including by accurately predicting technological and business trends, controlling research and development costs or executing our strategy, could significantly harm our reputation, market share, results of operations and financial condition. Many of our products and services are complex and we may experience delays in completing development or introducing new products or services in the future.\nIn addition, new technologies and new competitors continue to enter our markets at a faster pace than we have experienced in the past, resulting in increased competition. We may face increasing competition from both incumbents and emerging competitors as customer contracts become larger, more complicated, and include an expanded range of services or complex product requirements. Expansion of our products and services may result in the applicability of new legal and regulatory requirements and restrictions and compliance obligations. Failure to comply with such restrictions or obligations could result in liabilities, including potential enforcement actions, fines, penalties or reputational harm, or increase the costs of doing business or delay or limit the range of new products and services we may be able to offer. \nCatastrophic events may interrupt our business, or our customers’ or suppliers’ business, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and stock price.\nOur business operations, and the operations of our customers and suppliers, are subject to interruption by natural disasters (including climate change-related events), flooding, fire, power shortages, the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases and pandemics, terrorist acts or the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, and other events beyond our control. Catastrophic events could have varied impacts such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, including impacts to our workforce and supply chain, inflationary pressures and increased costs, schedule or production delays, market volatility and other financial impacts. These events have had, and in the future could continue to have, a negative impact on our ability to manage our business and/or cause disruption of economic activity, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and stock price.\nSocial, ethical, environmental, and competitive risks relating to the use of AI in our products and services could adversely affect our results of operations and business reputation.\nWe envision a future in which AI operating in our products and services will help our public safety and enterprise customers build safer communities. As we increasingly leverage AI, including generative AI, in our offerings, we may enable or offer products and services that draw controversy due to their actual or perceived impact on social and ethical issues resulting from the use of new and evolving AI. AI, including generative AI, may not always operate as intended and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased, harmful or offensive information, which could negatively impact our results of operations, environmental, social and governance (ESG) reputation, business reputation or customers’ acceptance of our AI offerings. Additionally, the energy consumption in data centers necessary to power AI systems may lead to actual or perceived environmental issues. Although we work to responsibly meet our customers’ needs for products and services that use AI, including through AI governance programs and internal technology oversight committees, we may still suffer reputational or competitive damage as a result of any inconsistencies in the application of the technology or ethical concerns, both of which may generate negative publicity.\nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI systems. Other companies may develop AI systems that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to develop and deploy. Additionally, customer demand for AI-based analytics may continue to increase at a fast rate. Therefore, the research and development cost we may incur to compete with such AI systems and meet increased customer demand for AI-based analytics may increase the cost of our offerings. If we are unable to mitigate these risks, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties, including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from the acquisitions.\nIn order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities or to meet other strategic needs such as product or technology gaps, we have made, and expect to continue to make, strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include: (i) the inability to realize our business plan with respect to the acquired businesses, (ii) the difficulty or inability in integrating newly-acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner, including ensuring proper integration of acquired businesses’ legal and regulatory compliance programs, information technology systems and financial reporting and internal control systems, (iii) the challenges in integrating acquired businesses to create the operating platform for physical security, (iv) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions, (v) the risk that our contractual relationships or the markets served do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets, (vi) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, (vii) the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our operations, (viii) the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience, (ix) future impairments of goodwill, (x) the potential loss of intellectual property due to actions of employees in connection with such acquisitions, (xi) the risks of exposure to new patent assertions by third-parties directed at the technologies of the newly acquired businesses, and (xii) the potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risk.\nCertain acquisition candidates in the industries in which we participate may carry higher relative valuations (based on revenues, earnings, cash flow, or other relevant multiples) than we do. Acquiring a business that has a higher relative valuation than Motorola Solutions may be dilutive to our earnings. In addition, we may not pursue opportunities that are highly dilutive to near-term earnings.\nKey employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of cash payments for their ownership interest, particularly in the case of founders and other shareholder employees, or as a result of change-in-control agreements, acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity-based compensation rights. To retain such employees and integrate the acquired business, we may offer additional retention incentives, but it may still be difficult to retain certain key employees.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nIf the quality of our products does not meet our customers' expectations or regulatory or industry standards, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.\nSome of the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used in the product. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from suppliers, or from finished products we purchase from other manufacturers, which we then resell to customers. Often these issues are identified prior to the shipment of the products and may cause delays in shipping products to customers, or even the cancellation of orders by customers. Sometimes, we discover quality issues in the products after they have been shipped to our customers, requiring us to resolve such issues in a timely manner that is the least disruptive to our customers, particularly in light of the mission-critical nature of our products. Such pre-shipment and post-shipment quality issues can have legal, financial and reputational ramifications, including: (i) delays in the recognition of revenue, loss of revenue or future orders, or revenue reversals, (ii) customer-imposed penalties for failure to meet contractual requirements, (iii) increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products, and (iv) a negative impact on our goodwill and brand name reputation. In some cases, if the quality issue affects the product's performance, safety or regulatory compliance, then such a “defective” product may need to be “stop-built”, “stop-shipped” or recalled. Depending on the nature of the quality issue and the number of products in the field, it could cause us to incur substantial recall or corrective field action costs, in addition to the costs associated with the potential loss of future orders and the damage to our goodwill or brand reputation. In addition, we may be required, under certain customer contracts, to pay damages for failed performance that might exceed the revenue that we receive from the contracts. Recalls and field actions involving regulatory non-compliance could also result in fines and additional costs. Recalls and field actions could result in third-party litigation by persons or companies alleging harm or economic damage as a result of the use of the products.\nIn addition, privacy advocacy groups and other technology and industry groups have established or may establish various new or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional obligations on us. Our customers may expect us to meet voluntary certifications or adhere to other standards established by third-parties. Alternatively, our customers may expect us to offer products and services to help reduce energy consumption, improve efficiency and minimize greenhouse gas footprints. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.\nOur future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and components, as well as software and services, at acceptable prices to meet the demands of our customers and any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies has had, and could continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur ability to meet customers' demands depends, in part, on our ability to timely obtain an adequate delivery of quality materials, parts, and components, as well as software and services, from our suppliers. If demand for our products or services increases from our current expectations or if, as we have experienced in the past, suppliers are unable to meet our demand for other reasons, including as a result of supply chain constraints; natural disasters (including events related to climate change); import/export restrictions, such as new, expanded or retaliatory tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers (including recent U.S. tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed on China, Canada and Mexico and other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries); financial issues or other factors, we have, and could continue to experience an interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of supply. We expect that any future supply chain effects could also impact our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur suppliers have in the past, and may continue in the future, to significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs related to the manufacture, distribution and/or repair of parts and components. As a result, we may not be able to increase our prices commensurately with our increased costs, which could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, certain supplies, including for some of our critical components, software and services solutions, are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner. Where certain supplies are not available from our direct suppliers, we may be required to move to an alternative source or source certain items through the open market, which involves significantly increased prices that are difficult to forecast or predict. Each of these factors may impact our ability to meet customer demand and could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks under large, multi-year system and services contracts that may negatively impact our business.\nWe enter into large, multi-year system and services contracts with municipal, state, and nationwide government and commercial customers. In some cases, we may not be the prime contractor and may be dependent on other third-parties such as commercial carriers or systems integrators. Our entry into these contracts exposes us to risks, including among others: (i) technological risks, (ii) risk of defaults by third-parties on whom we are relying for products or services as part of our offering or who are the prime contractors, (iii) financial risks, including potential penalties applicable to us if performance commitments in managed services contracts are not met, the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with such contracts, the fact that such contracts often only receive partial funding initially and may be cancellable on short notice with limited penalties, our inability to recover front-loaded capital expenditures in long-term managed services contracts, the impact of the termination of funding for a government program or the insolvency of a commercial customer, and the impact of currency fluctuations and inflation, (iv) cybersecurity risks, especially in managed services contracts with public safety and enterprise customers that process data, and (v) political or regulatory risks, especially related to the contracts with government customers, including our Airwave contract in the U.K., as described below. \nWith respect to the financial and political or regulatory risks of such contracts, in 2023 the CMA imposed a legal order on Airwave, which implemented the Charge Control. After the Competition Appeal Tribunal (\"CAT\") dismissed our appeal of the Charge Control, we appealed the CAT's judgment to the United Kingdom Court of Appeal, which denied our application for permission to appeal the CAT's judgment on January 30, 2025. With the United Kingdom Court of Appeal's ruling, revenue will continue to be recognized in accordance with the Charge Control.\nIn addition, after our receipt in March 2024 of the Deferred National Shutdown Notice from the Home Office, we recorded additional backlog of $748 million to reflect the incremental three years of services related to the extension of the \"national shutdown target date\" on the Airwave services to December 31, 2029. In April 2024 we filed proceedings in the U.K. High Court challenging the decision of the Home Office to issue the Deferred National Shutdown Notice as being in breach of applicable U.K. procurement and public law, and a hearing on this matter has been set to commence on April 22, 2025. The backlog related to the incremental years of service contemplated in the Deferred National Shutdown Notice could change depending on the outcome of the proceedings.\nOur employees, customers, suppliers and outsource partners are located throughout the world and, as a result, we face risks that other companies that are not global may not face.\nOur customers and suppliers are located throughout the world. In 2024, 28% of our revenue was generated outside of North America. In addition, 49% of our employees were employed outside of North America in 2024. Most of our suppliers' operations are outside the U.S.\nA significant amount of manufacturing and research and development of our products, as well as administrative and sales facilities, takes place outside of the U.S. If the operations in these facilities are disrupted, our business, financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nBecause of these sizable sales and operations outside of the U.S., we have more complexity in our operations and are exposed to a unique set of global risks that could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, including but not limited to: (i) currency fluctuations, including but not limited to increased pressure to agree to established currency conversion rates and cost of living adjustments as a result of foreign currency fluctuations, (ii) import/export regulations, tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes (including recent U.S. tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed on China, Canada and Mexico and other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries), customs classifications and certifications, including but not limited to changes in classifications or errors or omissions related to such classifications and certifications, (iii) compliance with and changes in U.S. and non-U.S. laws or regulations related to antitrust and competition (such as the CMA’s Charge Control and the EU Foreign Subsidies Regulation), anti-corruption (such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act), trade, labor and employment, environmental, health and safety, technical standards, consumer protection, intellectual property and data privacy, regulated services such as telecommunications, cybersecurity and AI, (iv) tax issues, such as tax law changes, variations in tax laws from country to country and as compared to the U.S., obligations under tax incentive agreements, and difficulties in securing local country approvals for cash repatriations, (v) reduced financial flexibility given that a significant percentage of our cash and cash equivalents is currently held outside of the U.S., (vi) challenges in collecting accounts receivable, (vii) cultural and language differences, (viii) instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, the imposition of sanctions and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts and terrorism, (ix) natural disasters, (x) public health issues or outbreaks or pandemics and (xi) litigation in foreign court systems and foreign enforcement or administrative proceedings. \nFurther, the benefits we receive under various agreements we have entered into with non-U.S. governments and agencies relate to our operations and/or sales in such foreign jurisdictions. If our operations or sales are not at levels originally anticipated, we may be at risk of having to reimburse benefits already granted, which could increase our cost of doing business in such foreign jurisdictions.\nOver the last several years, we have utilized third-parties to develop, design and/or manufacture many of our components and some of our products, and to perform portions of certain business operations such as IT, network connectivity, HR information systems, manufacturing, repair, distribution and engineering services. We expect to continue these practices in the future, which limit our control over these business operations and expose us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners.\nWe rely on third-parties to develop, design and/or manufacture many of our components and some of our products (including software), and to assist in performing certain IT, network connectivity, HR information systems, manufacturing, repair, distribution and engineering services. As we outsource more of such operations, we are not able to directly control these activities. We could have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and profits could decline if: (i) we are not able to engage such third-parties with the capabilities or capacities required by our business, (ii) such third-parties lack our desired level of performance or service, lack sufficient quality control or fail to deliver quality components, products, services or software on time and at reasonable prices, (iii) there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third-parties, (iv) our third-party providers fail to comply with legal or regulatory requirements (such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act), (v) we have difficulties transitioning operations to such third-parties, or (vi) such third-parties are disrupted by external events, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, public health issues, outbreaks or pandemics, extreme weather conditions related to climate change, acts of terrorism or political conflicts. \nOur reliance on third-parties could, in certain instances, result in reputational damage or even disqualify us from sales opportunities with certain government customers. For example, our supply chain is complex and if our suppliers are unable to verify that components and parts provided to us are free of defined “conflict minerals” originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”) or an adjoining country, then we may be required to publicly disclose, as we have disclosed in the past, that we are not currently able to determine if the products we manufactured are DRC conflict-free, which could harm our reputation. \nOnce a business activity is outsourced, we may be contractually prohibited from or may not practically be able to bring such activity back within the Company or move it to another outsource partner. The actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner or to adhere to our Human Rights Policy could negatively impact our business.\nWe engage subcontractors, including third-party integrators, on many of our contracts and as we expand our technologies in our segments, our use of subcontractors has and will continue to increase. Our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply third-party products and software from a number of smaller companies. In addition, it is our policy to require our subcontractors and other third-parties with whom we work to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including our Human Rights Policy (and, in addition, for our suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct).\nWe may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or its subcontractors and the functionality, warranty and indemnities of products, software and services supplied by our subcontractor. We are not always successful in passing down customer requirements to our subcontractors or a customer may otherwise look to us to cover a loss or damage, and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding back-to-back coverage from our subcontractor. Our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials, components, subsystems and services they supply, or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers, which might result in greater product returns, service problems, warranty claims and costs and regulatory compliance issues. Further, one of our subcontractors or other third-parties subject to our Human Rights Policy could fail to comply with such policies or with applicable law or may engage in unethical business practices. Any of the foregoing could cause orders to be canceled, relationships to be terminated or our reputation to be damaged, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, lawmakers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social and governance (“ESG”)-related practices and disclosures, as well as recent U.S. based anti-ESG efforts, may adversely affect our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees or customers, expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community or enforcement authorities or otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations. \nThere is increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, lawmakers, regulators and other stakeholders on ESG-related practices and disclosures, including those related to environmental stewardship, climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DEI\"), forced labor, and workplace conduct. Regulators have imposed, and likely will continue to impose, ESG-related legislation, rules and guidance, which may conflict with one another and impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks, including requiring additional reporting that will expand the public's access to our programs and metrics. In addition, recent \"anti-ESG\" sentiment has gained momentum in the U.S., with certain lawmakers and interest groups having proposed or enacted \"anti-ESG\" policies, legislation, or initiatives or issued related legal opinions. Furthermore, President Trump recently issued a series of executive orders, some of which target programs related to DEI and climate change. The Trump Administration has indicated that it will continue to scrutinize these programs. Moreover, certain organizations that provide information to investors have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to different ESG-related matters, and unfavorable ratings of us or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries. We have elected to share publicly our ongoing ESG-related efforts in our proxy statement, Corporate Responsibility Report, TCFD Report, and on our corporate website. Our business may face higher expectations as well as increased scrutiny related to these activities. Our failure or perceived failure to meet or maintain ESG-related goals or otherwise respond to anti-ESG efforts could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees or customers, expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community or enforcement authorities or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nExisting or future legislation and regulations pertaining to AI, AI-enabled products and the use of biometrics (e.g., facial recognition) or other video analytics that apply to us or to our customers may make it more challenging, costly, or in some cases prohibit certain products or services from being offered or modified and subject us to regulatory and litigation risks and potential liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nCurrent or future legislation and governmental regulations pertaining to AI, AI-enabled products and the use of biometrics or other video analytics may affect how our business is conducted or expose us to unfavorable developments resulting from changes in the regulatory landscape. For example, the AI Act in the EU became law in August 2024, with key obligations applying in stages through August 2027, including key provisions to us applying in early 2025 and August 2026. The AI Act will place significant restrictions on the use of AI for real-time “biometric identification” by law enforcement, and implement significant compliance requirements on the development and use of AI for biometric identification of any kind. Once implemented, the AI Act will also place compliance requirements on a variety of other AI uses by law enforcement, as well as on the companies that develop those products, including us. Other such laws are expected to pass around the globe, including the U.S. and Brazil, in the coming months and years. For example, in 2024, numerous U.S. states considered legislation that would establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for the use of AI. Colorado became the first state to enact such a law for private sector use of AI and New York enacted a law that will regulate public sector use of AI.\nWith respect to biometrics and other analytics, laws such as the Biometric Information Privacy Act in Illinois have restricted the collection, use and storage of biometric information and provide a private right of action of persons who are aggrieved by violations of the act. Additionally, laws such as the California automatic license plate recognition (“ALPR”) statute regulate the use of ALPRs and provide a private right of action to persons who have suffered actual damages from violation of the statute. The Federal Trade Commission has increasingly pursued enforcement actions against companies for the misuse of biometric information and the use of facial recognition technology without implementing appropriate safeguards. Current or future legislation, governmental regulations, and enforcement actions pertaining to biometrics and other analytics have exposed us to, and we expect will continue to expose us to, regulatory and litigation risks. \nLegislation and governmental regulations related to AI and the use of biometrics and other video analytics may also influence our current and prospective customers’ activities, as well as their expectations and needs in relation to our products and services. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and the risk of liability. It is also not clear how existing and future laws and regulations governing issues such as AI, AI-enabled products, biometrics and other video analytics apply or will be enforced with respect to the products and services we sell. \nAny such increase in costs or increased risk of liability as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually, or in the aggregate, make our products and services that use AI technologies, biometrics or other video analytics less attractive to our customers, cause us to change or limit our business practices or affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regarding cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, and information security which exposes us to increased costs and potential liabilities in the event of any actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal and compliance obligations and could adversely affect our business.\nVarious jurisdictions have adopted or are expected to introduce new laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, and information security which have impacted, or we expect will impact, us by exposing us to increased costs and potential liabilities. With respect to cybersecurity laws and regulations, this includes the EU Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (\"NIS2\"), which became effective in the EU in October 2024 and is in the process of implementation by each EU Member State. NIS2 requires us to register with national cybersecurity agencies, submit significant cybersecurity incident reports and adopt appropriate measures to minimize cybersecurity risks. We may also become subject to new cybersecurity laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, as well as supplier-focused cybersecurity obligations. Compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to increased costs and any noncompliance, whether actual or perceived, could result in potential liabilities. \nWith respect to privacy and data protection, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) which took effect in 2018, harmonizing data protection laws across the EU. The GDPR strengthens individual privacy rights and enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data. This includes expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information and mandatory data breach notification requirements. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger significant fines. \nU.S. federal, state and other foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, use, processing and disclosure of personal data. Numerous state governments within the U.S. have enacted their own versions of “GDPR-like” privacy legislation, which has created, and we expect will continue to create, additional compliance challenges, risks, and administrative burdens. Comprehensive U.S. federal privacy legislation is also being discussed seriously by lawmakers, and the Federal Trade Commission has commenced a privacy rulemaking that may attempt to implement nationwide rules. These proposals, as well as other standalone federal bills, could restrict the ability of law enforcement to purchase data from private companies. It is possible that a one-size fits all compliance program may be difficult to achieve and manage globally, and that we will be forced to comply with a patchwork of inconsistent privacy regulations.\nSeveral other countries in which we operate, including Australia and Brazil, have established legal requirements for cross-border data transfers. There is continued uncertainty concerning rules related to transfers of EU and United Kingdom (“U.K.”) personal data outside of their respective jurisdictions. There is also an increasing trend towards data localization policies. Cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation with respect to data localization requirements and restrictions on the international transfer of data. If countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border personal data transfers (or customers do not permit personal data to leave the country of origin), it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, which could adversely impact our business.\nBecause the interpretation and application of cybersecurity, privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations are complex and still uncertain, it is possible that they may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing practices or the features of our products, software and services. Any failure or perceived failure by us, our business partners, or third-party service providers to comply with such laws and regulations, or applicable commitments in contracts, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others and significant fines and penalties, and adversely affect our business.\nGovernment regulation of radio frequencies may limit the growth of private and public safety narrowband and broadband systems or reduce barriers to entry for new competitors.\nRadio spectrum is required to provide wireless voice, data, and video communications services. The allocation of frequencies is regulated in the U.S. and other countries and limited spectrum is allocated to wireless services, including commercial and public safety users. The global demand for wireless communications has grown exponentially, and spurred competition for access among various networks and users. In response, regulators are reassessing the allocations of spectrum among users, including public safety users, and considering whether to change the allocation of certain spectrum bands from narrowband to broadband use, or to require sharing of spectrum bands. Our results could be negatively affected by the rules and regulations adopted by regulators. Our products operate both on licensed and unlicensed spectrum. The loss of available radio spectrum may result in the loss of business opportunities. Regulatory changes in current spectrum bands (e.g., the sharing of previously dedicated or other spectrum) may require modifications to some of our products so they can continue to be manufactured and marketed.\nA portion of our business is dependent upon U.S. government contracts and grants, which are highly regulated and subject to disclosure obligations and oversight audits by U.S. government representatives and subject to cancellations. Any such disclosure events, audits or noncompliance with such regulations and laws could result in adverse findings and negatively impact our business.\nOur business with or funded by the U.S. government is subject to specific laws and regulations with numerous and unique compliance requirements relating to formation, administration and performance of U.S. federal or federally funded contracts. These requirements, which may increase or change over time, may increase our performance and compliance costs thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations or other failures to comply with these laws, regulations or other compliance requirements could lead to terminations for default, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or other adverse actions. Such laws, regulations or other compliance requirements include those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. government security and information security regulations, supply chain and sourcing requirements and restrictions, employment practices, protection of criminal justice data, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs, foreign corruption, Trade Agreements Act, Buy America Act, other domestic content requirements, and the False Claims Act. For example, President Trump issued an executive order in January 2025 that requires, in relevant part, that every federal contract or grant award include a clause that requires the contractor or grant recipient to (1) agree that its compliance with all applicable federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government’s payment decisions on such contract or grant for purposes of the False Claims Act, and (2) certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable federal anti-discrimination laws. The executive order increases our compliance risk through an increased risk of civil False Claims Act liability if our DEI practices are deemed to violate the federal anti-discrimination laws.\nGenerally, in the U.S., government contracts and grants are subject to certain voluntary or mandatory disclosure obligations and oversight audits by government representatives. Such disclosures or audits could result in adjustments to our contracts. For contracts covered by the Cost Accounting Standards, any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract may not be allowed, and such costs already reimbursed may have to be refunded. Future disclosures, audits and adjustments, if required, may materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of such disclosure events or audits. Negative disclosure or audit findings could also result in investigations, termination of a contract or grant, forfeiture of profits or reimbursements, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. All contracts with the U.S. government can be terminated for convenience by the government at any time.\nCertain of our offerings include services that are subject to telecommunications regulations in various jurisdictions, which expose us to increased costs to address compliance obligations and potential liability in the event of any failure to comply with such regulations, which could result in fines and penalties, reputational harm and adversely affect our business.\nWe are a provider of certain services that include telecommunications in the U.S., including selective routing services for 911 calls. As such, we are subject to certain Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and possible state regulations relating to telecommunications, including some certification or licensing, service reliability, and regulatory fee requirements. If we do not comply with these regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions, fines, and possibly loss of certifications or licenses to operate or offer certain of our services that are regulated telecommunications. Any enforcement action, which may be a public process, could also damage our reputation and erode customer trust.\nAdditionally, we are subject to regulations in certain foreign countries where we offer services that include telecommunications or other types of communications services. For example, we are registered to provide WAVE PTX push-to-talk offerings, with and without telecommunications connectivity, in certain countries internationally. Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, can differ significantly among the jurisdictions in which we provide these services. In some countries, certain services that we offer are not considered to be regulated communications services, while in other countries they are subject to regulations, including registration with the local telecommunications governing authority, which increases the level of scrutiny and potential for enforcement by regulators as well as our cost of doing business internationally. Further, enforcement and interpretations of the laws and regulations in some countries can be unpredictable and subject to the informal views of government officials. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, additional compliance obligations or liabilities, loss of authority to provide regulated services, and reputational harm, which could adversely affect our business.\nMoreover, it is possible that regulations in any of these jurisdictions may be changed, expanded or interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing practices. Future applicable legislative, regulatory or judicial actions could increase the cost and complexity of our compliance and increase our exposure to potential liability.\nWe are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety and environmental product compliance and remediation laws that continue to expand and could impact our ability to grow our business, could subject us to unexpected costs and liabilities and could impact our financial performance.\nOur operations and the products we manufacture are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety and environmental product compliance and remediation laws. Compliance with such existing or future laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, restrict what products and services we can offer, and generally impact our financial performance. Some of these laws are environmental and relate to the use, disposal, cleanup of, and exposure to certain substances. For example, in the U.S., laws often require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault and oftentimes in response to actions or omissions that were legal at the time they occurred. We continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations, including those resulting from previously or newly discovered environmental issues located at discontinued Company facilities and waste disposal sites formerly used by Company facilities, as well as current and former facilities of companies that we acquire. Changes to environmental laws or our discovery of additional obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our financial performance.\nLaws focused on: (i) the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories, (ii) recycling of both electronic products and packaging, (iii) reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products, (iv) the use and transportation of batteries, and (v) debt collection and other consumer finance matters continue to expand significantly. There are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as radio interference, radio frequency radiation exposure, medical related functionality, use of products with video functionality, and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment. These laws, and changes to these laws, could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products, solutions and services, on product costs, and on what capabilities and characteristics our products or services can or must include, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nIncreased focus on climate change has contributed to an evolving state of environmental regulation and uncertainty related to such regulation, as well as physical risks of climate change, could impact our business, results of operations, financial or competitive position.\nIncreased public awareness and worldwide focus on climate change has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, which has resulted in and may continue to result in, more international, federal or regional requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Additionally, legislative and regulatory efforts have focused on carbon taxes in certain areas where we operate. As a result, we may become subject to new or strengthened regulations, legislation or other governmental requirements or industry standards, and we anticipate that we will need to meet criteria related to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the elimination of certain constituents from products and increasing energy efficiency requirements. For example, the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, EU's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and EU taxonomy initiatives will introduce, in staggered timelines, additional due diligence and disclosure requirements addressing sustainability that will apply to us in the coming years. These requirements will, and other increased regulation of climate change concerns could, subject us to additional costs, disclosures and restrictions, and could require us to make certain changes to our manufacturing practices, operations, and/or product designs, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nIn addition, the physical risks of climate change (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs. This may include, potentially, costs associated with repairing damage as a result of extreme weather events or renovating or retrofitting facilities to better withstand extreme events. Many of our facilities around the world, as well as our customers' and suppliers' operations, are in locations that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers such as loss or spoilage of inventory and business interruption caused by such events.\nTax matters could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign tax jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability may be negatively impacted by: (i) changes in the mix of earnings taxable in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, (ii) changes in tax laws and accounting principles, (iii) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, (iv) changes in available tax credits, (v) discovery of new information during the course of tax return preparation, (vi) increases in non-deductible expenses, or (vii) repatriating cash held abroad.\nSince our 2022 tax year, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 has required that we capitalize and amortize our research and experimental expenditures over five or fifteen years, as applicable. This change in law had a materially negative impact on our cash tax liability in 2024, and we expect such change to continue to impact our cash tax liability through 2026, unless the provisions are repealed or deferred by Congress.\nTax audits may also negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns, and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax. We regularly evaluate the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Outcomes from these continuing examinations may have a negative impact on our future financial condition and operating results.\nCertain tax policy efforts, including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, the European Commission’s state aid investigations, and other initiatives could have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses. Furthermore, many of the countries where we are subject to taxes, including the U.S., are independently evaluating their tax policy and we may see significant changes in legislation and regulations concerning taxation. Certain countries have already enacted legislation, which could affect international businesses, and other countries have become more aggressive in their approach to audits and enforcement of their applicable tax laws. Such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies, or practices, could increase our effective tax rates in many of the countries where we have operations and have an adverse effect on our overall tax rate, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Intellectual Property \nIncreased cybersecurity threats could lead to a security breach or other significant disruption of our IT systems, those of our outsource partners, suppliers or those we manufacture, install, and in some cases operate and maintain for our customers, and could have a negative impact on our operations, sales, and operating results.\nWe rely extensively on our information systems to manage our business operations. We are subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems from both internal and external sources. Like all information technology systems, our systems have been in the past, and could be in the future, vulnerable to damage, unauthorized access or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to, cyberattacks, cyber intrusions, computer viruses, security breaches, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware or other malware, energy blackouts, natural disasters and severe weather conditions, terrorism, sabotage, wars, insider threats, human errors and computer and telecommunication failures. As a provider of mission-critical physical security products and services for both public safety and enterprise customers in the U.S. and globally, including systems that we operate and maintain for certain customers of ours or as a software-based service, we face additional risk as a potential target of sophisticated attacks aimed at compromising both our company’s and our customers’ sensitive information and intellectual property. This risk is heightened because these systems may contain sensitive governmental information or personally identifiable or other protected information. Our vulnerability and that of our third-party vendors to cyber and other information technology risks may also be increased by factors such as cyberattacks related to geopolitical conflicts (which may be heightened by our global presence) and the large portion of our office workforce that continues to work from home. Additionally, the volume, frequency and sophistication of these threats (including through the use of AI) continues to grow and the complexity and scale of the systems to be protected continues to increase. As we continue to integrate the use of AI to enhance our accounting operations and help improve employee productivity and efficiency, we also face enhanced risks and challenges related to cybersecurity and information technology. Like other enterprise software companies, we also use open source software from time to time, which may be more susceptible to vulnerabilities that may not be identified with scanning tools. In an effort to protect against such attacks, we maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks and employ a number of countermeasures and security controls, including training, audits, encryption, and utilization of commercial information security threat sharing networks. If we fail to effectively manage our cybersecurity, our business, products, and services could suffer from the resulting weaknesses in our infrastructure, systems or controls. \nFurther, our company outsources certain business operations, including, but not limited to IT, network connectivity, HR information systems, manufacturing, repair, distribution and engineering services. We are dependent, in certain instances, upon our outsourced business partners, suppliers, and customers to adequately protect our IT systems and those IT systems that we manage for our customers, including the hosts of our cloud infrastructure on top of which our cloud-based solutions are built, as well as the network connectivity upon which some of our services are built. Some of our customers are exploring broadband solutions that use public carrier networks on which our solutions would operate. We do not have direct oversight or influence over how public carrier networks manage the security, quality, or resiliency of their networks, and because they are an attractive high value target due to their role in critical infrastructure, they expose customers to an elevated risk over our private networks. In addition, we maintain certain networked equipment at customer locations and are reliant on those customers to protect and maintain that equipment.\nA cyberattack or other significant disruption involving our IT systems or those of our outsource partners, suppliers or our customers could result in substantial costs to repair or replace our IT systems or the loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability, or that of our customers, to perform critical functions. Such disruption may also result in the unauthorized release of proprietary, confidential or sensitive information of us or our customers, or the disruption of services provided to customers and essential for their mission. Such unauthorized access to, or release of, information or disruption of services could: (i) allow others to unfairly compete with us, (ii) compromise safety or security, given the mission-critical nature of our customers’ systems, (iii) subject us to claims for breach of contract, tort, and other civil claims without adequate indemnification from our suppliers, (iv) subject us to time-intensive notification requirements, (v) damage our reputation, and (vi) require us to provide modifications or replacements to our products and services. Our potential liability related to such claims by customers or third-parties described above may not be contractually capped nor fully covered by our insurance, and our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We could face regulatory penalties, enforcement actions, remediation obligations and/or private litigation by parties whose data is improperly disclosed or misused. Any or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, or if we, our customers and/or our suppliers are found to have infringed intellectual property rights of third parties, our competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur intellectual property rights protect our innovations and technology, and they may also generate income under license agreements. We attempt to protect our proprietary technology with intellectual property in the form of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and other methods. We also generally restrict access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to obtain and use our proprietary information or develop similar technology independently. As we expand our business, including through acquisitions, and compete with new competitors in new markets, the breadth and strength of our intellectual property portfolio in those new markets may not be as developed as in our longer-standing businesses. This may expose us to a heightened risk of litigation and other challenges from competitors in these new markets. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third-parties and the cost of any litigation necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a negative impact on our financial results and competitive position. Moreover, the validity and scope of coverage of our patents cannot be fully determined prior to litigation.\nAdditionally, because our products are comprised of complex technology, we are often involved in or impacted by assertions, including both requests for licenses and litigation, regarding third-party patents and other intellectual property rights. The development of products operable in accordance with industry standards, such as those related to 4G, 5G, audio, video, or various other wireless technologies may result in third-party patent royalty demands. Third-parties have asserted, and in the future may assert, intellectual property infringement claims against us and against our customers and suppliers. Many of these assertions are brought by non-practicing entities whose principal business model is to secure patent licensing-based revenue from product manufacturing companies. The patent holders often make broad and sweeping claims regarding the applicability of their patents to our products and services, seeking a percentage of sales as licenses fees, seeking injunctions to pressure us into taking a license, or a combination thereof. Third-party litigation funding exacerbates this situation, sometimes hindering the ability to settle matters. Defending claims may be expensive and divert the time and efforts of our management and employees. Third-parties may also seek broad injunctive relief, which could limit our ability to sell our products in the U.S. or elsewhere with intellectual property subject to the claims. If we do not succeed in any such litigation, we could be required to expend significant resources to pay damages, develop non-infringing products or to obtain licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of such litigation, each of which could have a negative impact on our financial results. Such licenses, if available at all, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. In some cases, we might be forced to stop delivering certain products if we or our customers or suppliers are subject to a final injunction.\nWe face risks relating to intellectual property licenses and intellectual property indemnities in our customer and supplier contracts, which may fail to fully protect us and subject us to unexpected liabilities or harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe obtain some technology from suppliers through the purchase of components or licensing of software, and we attempt to negotiate favorable intellectual property indemnities with our suppliers for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. With respect to such indemnities, we may not be successful in our negotiations, a supplier's indemnity may not fully protect us or cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers due to the infringing products, or a supplier may not choose to obtain a third-party license or modify or replace its products with non-infringing products which would otherwise mitigate such damages and losses. Such situations may subject us to unexpected liabilities or unfavorable conditions. Further, we may not be able to participate in intellectual property litigation involving a supplier and may not be able to influence any ultimate resolution or outcome that may negatively impact our sales or operations if a court enters an injunction that enjoins the supplier's products or if the International Trade Commission issues an exclusionary order that blocks importation of our products into the U.S. Intellectual property disputes involving our suppliers have resulted in our involvement in International Trade Commission proceedings from time to time. These proceedings are costly and entail the risk that we will be subjected to a ban on the importation of our products into the U.S. solely as a result of our use of a supplier's components.\nIn addition, our customers increasingly demand that we indemnify them broadly from all damages and losses resulting from intellectual property litigation against them. These demands may stem from non-practicing entities that engage in patent enforcement and litigation, sometimes seeking royalties and litigation judgments in proportion to the value of the use of our products, rather than in proportion to the cost of our products. Such demands can amount to many times the selling price of our products.\nFurther, competitors may be able to negotiate significantly more favorable terms for intellectual property than we are able to, which puts them at a competitive advantage. Moreover, with respect to our internally developed proprietary software, we may be harmed if we are forced to make publicly available, under the relevant open-source licenses, some of that proprietary software as a result of either our use of open-source software code or the use of third-party software that contains open-source code.\nWe no longer own certain logos and other trademarks, trade names and service marks, including MOTOROLA, MOTO, MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS and the Stylized M logo and all derivatives and formatives thereof (“Motorola Marks”) and we license the Motorola Marks from Motorola Trademark Holdings, LLC (“MTH”), which is currently owned by Motorola Mobility, a subsidiary of Lenovo. Our joint use of the Motorola Marks could result in product and market confusion and negatively impact our ability to expand business under the Motorola brand. In addition, if we do not comply with the terms of the license agreement we could lose our rights to the Motorola Marks.\nIn 2010, we secured a worldwide, perpetual and royalty-free license from MTH to use the Motorola Marks as part of our corporate name and in connection with the manufacture, sale, and marketing of our current products and services. The license of the Motorola Marks is important to us because of the reputation of the Motorola brand for our products and services. There are risks associated with both Motorola Mobility and us using the Motorola Marks and our loss of ownership of the Motorola Marks. As both we and Motorola Mobility use the Motorola Marks, confusion could arise in the market, including customer confusion regarding the products offered by and the actions of the two companies. Also, any negative publicity associated with either company in the future could adversely affect the public image of the other. \nMotorola Mobility was acquired by Lenovo in 2014, which resulted in Lenovo having effective control over the Motorola Marks. Our risks under the license could increase if Lenovo expands its use of the Motorola Marks, or if our products and those of Lenovo converge. In addition, because our license of the Motorola Marks is limited to products and services within our specified fields of use, we are not permitted to use the Motorola Marks in other fields of use without the approval of Motorola Mobility. As we continue to expand our business into any other fields of use, we either must do so with a brand other than the Motorola brand, which could take considerable time and expense, or assume the risk that our expanded fields don’t meet the definition of permitted fields of use under our license, which could result in loss of our rights to use the Motorola Marks. \nWe could lose our rights to use the Motorola Marks if we do not comply with the terms of the license agreement. Such a loss could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, MTH has certain rights to license the brand to third-parties and either Motorola Mobility or licensed third-parties may use the brand in ways that make the brand less attractive for customers of Motorola Solutions, creating increased risk that Motorola Solutions may need to develop an alternate or additional brand. Motorola Mobility may require us to adopt modifications to the Motorola Marks, and this could negatively impact our business, including costs associated with rebranding.\nNeither Motorola Mobility nor Lenovo is prohibited from selling the Motorola Marks. In the event of a liquidation by Lenovo or the then-owner of the Motorola Marks, it is possible that a bankruptcy court would either (i) permit the Motorola Marks to be assigned to a third-party whose interests may be incompatible with ours, thereby potentially making the license arrangement difficult to administer and increasing the costs and risks of sharing the Motorola Marks, or (ii) refuse to uphold the license or certain of its terms, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Human Capital Management\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain senior management and key employees, including engineers and other key technical employees, in order to remain competitive.\nThe performance of our CEO, senior management and other key employees such as engineers and other technical employees is critical to our success. If we are unable to retain talented, highly-qualified senior management, engineers and other key employees or attract them when needed, it could negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on the experience of our senior management, most of whom have been with us for many years and as a result have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace and competition for management with experience in the communications industry is intense. A loss of the CEO, a member of senior management, or an engineer or other key employee, particularly to a competitor, could also place us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, we face increased demands for technical personnel in areas such as software development, which is an area of particularly high demand for skilled employees. We believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire, assimilate, retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly-skilled personnel needed to develop successful new products or services. In particular, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, intense competition globally for experienced software and cloud computing infrastructure engineers, as well as employees in data science and AI. The compensation and incentives we have available to attract, retain and motivate employees may not meet the expectations of current and prospective employees. Our efforts to attract, develop, integrate, and retain highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications may be compounded by the increased availability of remote working arrangements, which has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. Further, if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our CEO, senior management and other key employees, our business could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Financial Performance or Economic Conditions\nAs we are a global company, we face a number of risks related to current global economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate that have and could continue to unfavorably impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGlobal economic and political conditions continue to be challenging for many of our government and enterprise markets, as economic growth in many countries has remained low or declined, currency fluctuations have impacted profitability, credit markets have remained tight for certain counterparties of ours and some of our customers are dependent on government grants to fund purchases of our products and services.\nIn addition, global conflicts, including the China-Taiwan conflict and those in the Middle East, as well as the results of elections or other political conditions, have created, and could create in the future, many economic and political uncertainties that impact worldwide markets, including impacts relating to new, increased or retaliatory tariffs (including recent U.S. tariffs imposed or threatened to be imposed on China, Canada and Mexico and other countries and any retaliatory actions taken by such countries) and potential trade wars, and threats to national security vulnerabilities linked to country of origin. The length of time these adverse economic and political conditions may persist is unknown.\nThese global economic and political conditions have impacted and could continue to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in a number of ways, including:\n•Requests by certain of our government and enterprise customers that we provide vendor financing, including in response to financial challenges surrounding state and local governments, which may cause us to retain exposure to the credit quality of our customers who we finance if we are unable to sell these receivables on terms acceptable to us. \n•The inability of certain of our customers to obtain financing in order to make purchases from us and/or maintain their business, which may negatively impact our financial results.\n•Challenges we face in budgeting and forecasting due to economic uncertainties in various parts of the U.S. and world economy, which could negatively impact our financial results if such budgets or forecasts are inaccurate.\n•Deferment or cancellation of purchases and orders by customers may occur due to uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions, which could reduce future demand for our products and negatively impact our financial results.\n•Intensifying political instability in a number of markets in which we operate could have a significant impact on our ability to grow and, in some cases, operate in such locations, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe may not continue to have access to the capital markets for financing on acceptable terms and conditions, particularly if our credit ratings are downgraded, which could limit our ability to repay our indebtedness and could cause liquidity issues.\nFrom time to time we access the capital markets to obtain financing. Our access to the capital markets and the bank loan markets at acceptable terms and conditions are impacted by many factors, including: (i) our credit ratings, (ii) the condition of the overall capital markets, (iii) strength and credit availability in the banking markets, and (iv) the state of the global economy. In addition, we frequently access the credit markets to obtain performance bonds, bid bonds, standby letters of credit and surety bonds, as well as to hedge foreign exchange risk and sell receivables. Furthermore, we may not be able to refinance our existing indebtedness (i) on commercially reasonable terms, (ii) on terms, including with respect to interest rates, as favorable as our current debt, or (iii) at all. We may not continue to have access to the capital markets or bank credit markets on terms acceptable to us and if we are unable to repay or refinance our debt, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate enough cash flows from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt, fund our planned capital expenditures or pay future dividends.\nWe are rated investment grade by all three national rating agencies. Any downward changes by the rating agencies to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. Under certain circumstances, an increase in the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility, if any amounts are borrowed under such facility, could negatively affect our operating cash flows. In addition, a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our ability to: (i) access the capital markets or bank credit markets, (ii) issue commercial paper (iii) provide performance bonds, bid bonds, standby letters of credit and surety bonds, (iv) hedge foreign exchange risk, (v) fund our foreign affiliates, (vi) sell receivables, and (vii) obtain favorable trade terms with suppliers. In addition, we may avoid taking actions that would otherwise benefit us or our stockholders, such as engaging in certain acquisitions or engaging in stock repurchases, that would negatively impact our credit rating.\nOur exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.\n We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, has had in the past, and could continue to, cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has in the past, and could continue to, negatively affect our results of operations.\nReturns on pension and retirement plan assets and interest rate changes could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nWe have underfunded pension obligations, in part resulting from the fact that we retained almost all of the U.S. pension liabilities and a major portion of our non-U.S. pension liabilities following our past divestitures. The funding position of our pension plans is affected by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity and debt markets, and the interest rates used to calculate our pension obligations for funding and expense purposes. Minimum annual pension contributions are determined by government regulations and calculated based upon our pension funding status, interest rates, and other factors. If the financial markets perform poorly, we have been and could be required to make additional large contributions. The equity and debt markets can be volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can affect our contribution requirements. In volatile capital market environments, the uncertainty of material changes in future minimum required contributions increases.",
