      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOVERVIEW\nInstacart is powering the future of grocery through technology. We partner with retailers to help them successfully navigate the digital transformation of their businesses.\nInstacart was founded in 2012 to bring the grocery industry online and help make grocery shopping effortless. We want to enable any retailer, large or small, to drive success both online and in-store and serve their customers better in all of the ways they choose to shop. We have demonstrated our ability to help our retail partners drive strong growth and stay competitive in a complex and increasingly digital industry. \nInstacart invented a new model for online grocery shopping by offering consumers on-demand delivery from the stores they know and trust. Retailers reach customers through both Instacart Marketplace, where customers can shop from their favorite retailers through our app or website, and retailers’ owned and operated online storefronts that are powered by Instacart Enterprise Platform, our end-to-end technology solution encompassing e-commerce, fulfillment, Connected Stores, ads and marketing, and insights. \nWhen shopping for groceries, consumers want selection, quality, affordability, and convenience, and they shop in many different ways. Instacart started as a way for households to conveniently manage their weekly grocery shopping, a recurring and high order value consumer use case. Today, customers can place orders for delivery or pickup across a variety of use cases including the weekly shop, bulk stock-up, convenience, special occasions, from restaurants, and using our in-store technologies. \nAs consumers and retailers move online, brands can use Instacart Ads as an effective way to reach customers at the point of purchase and within minutes of delivery and consumption. Instacart Ads offers brands a highly measurable ads offering that leverages first-party transaction data to move products off of store shelves more efficiently.\nInstacart is built for the entire grocery ecosystem, improving the experiences for each of our constituents and helping them succeed:\n•Retailers. We enable more than 1,800 retail banners as of December 31, 2024 to grow by providing technology that can accelerate the digital transformation of their entire business both online and in-store. \n•Customers. As of December 31, 2024, we reach 98% of households in North America, and help our customers shop at their favorite retailers, order from their favorite restaurants, and enjoy selection, quality, affordability, and convenience. Our membership program, Instacart+, offers expanded customer benefits including unlimited $0 delivery fees on orders over a certain size, and other exclusive benefits.\n•Brands. We represent one of the largest and fast growing e-commerce channels for brands. We provide discovery and attractive return on investment for over 7,000 active brands through our industry-leading advertising tools and insights purpose-built for the online grocery category(1). We estimate that on average, our ads deliver more than a 15% incremental sales lift, and in some cases twice that, for our brand partners.(2)\n•Shoppers. As of December 31, 2024, we offer approximately 600,000 shoppers an immediate, flexible earnings opportunity that allows them to choose when and how much to work.(3) Shoppers are deeply valued members of the Instacart community, and we strive to make the shopping experience as seamless as possible and protect shoppers while they work so they can continue to deliver superior customer service. We offer shoppers a mobile application (iOS and Android) that powers the entire shopper experience seamlessly.\n___________\n(1) In the fourth quarter of 2024, we updated our active brands calculation to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates contributed approximately 500 active brands to our reported active brands as of December 31, 2024.\n(2) Based on internal tests run across all brand partners during the year ended December 31, 2024 and individual tests run for select brands or types of brands.\n(3) Based on shoppers who completed at least one order during the month ended December 31, 2024.\nINSTACART TECHNOLOGY\nWe built Instacart to serve the entire grocery ecosystem. The key pillars of our technology are Instacart Marketplace, Instacart Enterprise Platform, and Instacart Ads. Our solutions are underpinned by a shared foundation of technology, infrastructure, data insights, and fulfillment that leverages our scale and expertise specific to the grocery category. Our technology solutions are better together. Since our founding, Instacart has powered more than one billion orders. Our technology and data insights drive efficiencies for retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers. \nInstacart Marketplace\nThrough Instacart Marketplace we help customers find their favorite products, provide an innovative ad offering that inspires people to try new brands, connect customers to our dedicated shopper community, and help retailers and customers build deeper relationships. We help retailers serve their customers’ needs as to how and where they want to shop by supporting a wide array of fulfillment options, shopping occasions, and categories.\nInstacart Enterprise Platform\nInstacart Enterprise Platform is an end-to-end technology solution that powers retailers across all aspects of their business. Our offerings are modular, allowing retail partners to pick and choose which technologies best fit their needs. These solutions work seamlessly together, so retailers can more efficiently integrate with Instacart than they can with multiple separate technologies. Key components of Instacart Enterprise Platform include:\n•e-commerce. We power world class e-commerce storefronts for approximately 600 retail banners and services as of December 31, 2024, from product discovery tools, to merchandising, to different payment models, to loyalty-as-a-service.\n•Fulfillment. We help retailers fulfill grocery orders directly from their stores through a community of dedicated shoppers. Retailers — from national and regional retailers to local mainstays — can leverage our fulfillment API to help fulfill orders that are placed through their owned and operated online storefronts. In most instances, Instacart shoppers pick, pack, and deliver these orders, but retailers can also use our technology to enable orders that are picked and packed by their own employees, or use a combination of the two.\n•Connected Stores. Instacart helps retailers create a unified, seamless, and personalized experience across their online and in-store footprints by leveraging technologies like Caper Carts, Carrot Tags, Eversight, FoodStorm, In-Store mode, Out of Stock Insights, and Storefront.\n•Ads and Marketing. Carrot Ads, our enterprise ads offering, brings the best of Instacart Ads to retailers’ and other partners’ owned and operated online storefronts and apps. Our retail partners can also utilize our suite of marketing solutions, from self-serve tools to fully customized strategic partnerships, to grow their business by serving targeted promotions to customers.\n•Insights. Insights gives retailers near real-time visibility into key metrics like item popularity, inventory levels and availability, order sizes, delivery times, delivery ratings, and sales, which enables retailers to optimize operations and provide better customer experiences.\nInstacart Ads\nInstacart Ads combines the best of digital advertising — precision, actionability, and measurability — with the ability to directly move products off the shelves at stores, getting these products into the hands of customers within hours. Because it offers brands a way to reach customers at the point of purchase and within minutes of delivery and consumption, our solution delivers highly measurable and strong return on investment across all parts of the customer shopping journey, from awareness to consideration to purchase. We have a wide breadth of advertising solutions, including Sponsored Product ads, display ads, coupons, and brand pages, to meet all of our brand partners’ needs. Instacart Ads also enables brands to learn more about general consumer behavior from discovery to purchase, offering valuable insights about how to optimize their advertising spend. \nSALES AND MARKETING\nWhile our brand and leading market position enable us to benefit from organic, word-of-mouth growth, we use sales and marketing to attract retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers and grow the pie for all of our constituents. Our marketing strategy includes consumer marketing, retail partnerships, brand partnerships, and shopper marketing. Consumer marketing includes digital marketing campaigns across a variety of platforms and channels, referral coupons and incentives, and in-store marketing. We also collaborate to run co-marketing initiatives with retailers and brands to attract new customers. Shopper marketing attracts new shoppers and retains our existing shopper base by using referral coupons, promotional campaigns, and engagement programs. To date, the majority of customers have come to Instacart through organic channels. We believe we have a significant opportunity to build awareness to fuel new customer acquisition and increase engagement, and we plan to prudently invest in brand marketing and other awareness campaigns in the future. \nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete for retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers across each offering of our end-to-end technology suite based on a number of factors:\n•Retailers. We compete for retailers based on factors such as the quality of our technology including performance, flexibility, ease of use, scalability, reliability, pricing, breadth of fulfillment capabilities, our ability to innovate, quality of support, and other professional services and ability to meet their needs in a cost-efficient manner.\n•Customers. We compete for customers based on factors such as the quality of customer experience, selection, affordability, and convenience.\n•Brands. We compete for brands based on factors such as the breadth of our offerings, technology capabilities, ease of use, strength of data insights and analytics, our ability to innovate, consumer reach, and pricing.\n•Shoppers. We compete for shoppers based on factors such as flexibility, earnings potential, safety and overall experience, and our brand.\nNew services and offerings from competitors, trends in consumer shopping behavior, macroeconomic factors, and other conditions, events, trends, or circumstances also impact our ability to compete for each of our constituents.\nFor additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—The markets in which we participate are highly and increasingly competitive, with well-capitalized and better-known competitors, some of which are also partners. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.”\nSEASONALITY\nWe experience seasonality in both the number of orders and GTV on Instacart, as well as in our advertising and other revenue. We typically see lower levels of order volume in the second and third quarter, resulting from lower usage of our offerings during the spring and summer months, followed by higher levels of order volume during the holiday season. In addition, our advertising and other revenue has historically been seasonally high in the fourth quarter and seasonally low in the first quarter in a given year as a result of how advertisers deploy their budgets. Seasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide variety of complex laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. The laws and regulations govern many issues related to our business practices, including those regarding privacy, data security, data protection, pay and fee transparency, health information privacy and security, consumer protection, marketing and advertising, health and safety, import and export, food and product safety, zoning, sustainability, tax, insurance, employment, shopper rights, weights and measures, alcohol and other age-restricted products, worker classification, collective bargaining rights, internet usage and access, e-commerce, and electronic payments.\nAs we operate in a relatively new industry where clear guidance is not available for the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, issued, enacted, superseded, or amended in a manner that could harm our business. These changes may occur immediately or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory, legislative, \nand governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. As we expand our business into new markets or introduce new features, fulfillment methods, or offerings into existing markets, regulatory or legislative bodies or courts may claim that we or shoppers on Instacart are subject to additional requirements, or that we are prohibited from conducting business in certain jurisdictions.\nBecause we classify shoppers as independent contractors in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to a variety of local, municipal, state, federal, and international laws and regulations governing worker classification, compensation, pay and fee transparency, and payment and benefits rules. For example, in November 2020, voters in California voted in favor of, and on December 11, 2020, the California Secretary of State certified Proposition 22, which required gig economy companies like Instacart to, among other things, provide independent contractors working in California with a minimum level of earnings as well as healthcare subsidy payments. Therefore, our compliance with Proposition 22 has increased our costs in California and we expect such costs to remain elevated. Several other states in which we operate have and may continue to adopt legislation that provides for compensation and benefits for independent contractors similar to Proposition 22 or may challenge the status of independent contractors altogether. Regulations like this will impact our costs, may impair or prevent our ability to continue to operate, and may impact customer pricing and our ability to enable the same customer experience we have historically provided. Additionally, we are continually subject to administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of shoppers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various employment and other laws that would apply to employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. \nOur technology, and the user data from retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers that we collect and process to run our business, are an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our compliance with laws and regulations dealing with the collection, use, disclosure, and other processing of personal information is core to our strategy to improve our technology and user experience. Regulators and legislatures around the world have adopted or proposed increasingly stringent requirements regarding the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personal information and other data. Regulators and private litigants are more actively enforcing these requirements, and violating them carries substantial penalties. Examples of such laws include the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Section 5 of the FTC Act, and related state laws, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and various state privacy acts, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, and the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. In addition, expanding our business to European markets would subject us to some of the world’s most stringent data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and United Kingdom, which could limit our ability to do business in those markets.\nSee the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur intellectual property is an important component of our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other legal and contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 692 issued patents in the United States and approximately 650 patent applications (including active Patent Cooperation Treaty applications) pending in the United States and globally. While we believe our patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is material to us as a whole.\nWe have trademark rights in our name and other brand indicia, and have trademark registrations for select marks in the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. As of December 31, 2024, we also had approximately 162 copyright registrations. We also register domain names for certain websites that we use in our business, such as www.instacart.com, as well as similar variations to protect our brands and marks from cybersquatters. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and registrability of new intellectual property.\nWe control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. It is our practice to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements (or similar agreements) with our employees, consultants, and contractors involved in the development of intellectual property on our behalf. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential information and proprietary information. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in our terms of service. We intend to pursue additional actions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.\nSee the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a total of 3,265 full-time employees worldwide. We also engage with contractors, vendors, and consultants. We have invested substantial time and resources into building our team and believe that our employee relations are strong. Our success depends in large part on the efforts of our management, highly-skilled software engineers, sales personnel, and other professionals. Therefore, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain high-performing employees from all demographics by providing competitive compensation and benefits, fostering a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, while making opportunities available for all our employees to grow and develop in their careers. Our board of directors and compensation committee oversee our human capital strategy, which is developed and managed under the leadership of our Chief People Officer, who reports to our Chief Executive Officer.\nCompensating and Supporting Our Employees\nInstacart is committed to providing equitable compensation opportunities and rewarding employees who achieve results, embody our mission and values, and help others succeed. We also believe in supporting our employees’ personal and professional growth as well as their health and wellness.\nProviding Equitable and Competitive Compensation. Our philosophy is to provide our employees with market competitive and equitable compensation that rewards high performance. To ensure equitable compensation for our employees, we consider external market data as well as internal parity for all compensation decisions. Periodically, under the direction of legal counsel, we conduct comprehensive reviews of employee compensation to help ensure equitable pay practices. To incentivize high performance, we aim to reward eligible employees with pay increases and equity awards in recognition of their contributions. We believe our compensation practices help us attract and retain talented employees in a competitive labor market.\nSupporting Our Employees. Our employees work hard to ensure the success of our business, and we know that hard work requires strong support. That is why we are deeply committed to investing in resources to help our employees grow and thrive. We take a holistic approach to supporting employee well-being through providing eligible employees and their eligible dependents with competitive health and wellness benefits, retirement savings, and work-life options tailored to help keep them and their families feeling their best. In addition, in 2022, we adopted our Flex First workforce model, which provides our eligible employees with the option to work remotely, in one of our offices, or a combination of both. We believe this provides our employees with the flexibility to support their personal needs while maintaining our high-performing and collaborative culture. We are also devoted to investing in the development of our employees through learning tools and opportunities to help them achieve their personal and professional goals.\nSupporting a High-Performing Workforce \nOne of our human capital priorities is building and maintaining the highest performing workforce we are able through attracting, developing and retaining qualified talent from diverse backgrounds at every level of our organization. We have developed a number of initiatives throughout the employee life cycle to achieve this objective.\nAccessing the Available Talent Pool. Our recruitment processes are intended to promote access to hiring opportunities for talented applicants from a variety of backgrounds. For example, we encourage hiring managers to consider a diverse group of qualified candidates at the panel interview stage. We have also implemented programs to attract qualified talent from all backgrounds. For example, we offer prospective candidates conversations with members of our Employee \nResource Groups (“ERGs”), which are employee-led groups open to all employees that help create an inclusive culture, to all candidates so they can get a better understanding of our culture. Lastly, we provide training to recruiters, hiring managers, and interviewers on our recruiting practices, with the goal of ensuring that all candidates are seen and evaluated fairly. These efforts help ensure we have access to a diverse pool of talented candidates that strengthens our workforce’s overall capabilities.\nEnsuring Access to Opportunities while Minimizing Attrition. We recognize that hiring exceptional talent is just the first step in facilitating employee success and building a high-performing workforce; we also prioritize retaining all talent and work to ensure that all employees have equal access to development, advancement, and internal opportunities. To help accomplish this, we support all of our managers with training and resources designed to help them create an enriching environment within their teams. This includes conducting fair and objective performance reviews, considering promotion readiness, and, for eligible employees, providing opportunities for internal mobility. \nFostering an Inclusive Environment. We believe that creating an inclusive environment not only drives performance but also fosters innovation, collaboration, and long-term success. To ensure Instacart remains a welcoming environment for all employees, while also intentionally focusing on inclusion for all talent, we are constantly investing in our culture and creating opportunities to build community for all of our employees. Members of our executive team personally sponsor ERGs and Instacart allocates funding to our ERGs every year for programming and initiatives that range from professional development sessions, employee networking opportunities, and volunteer events to belonging and engagement opportunities. Additionally, in order to improve collaboration among diverse teams, we have invested in resources to educate our employees on building an inclusive culture and on recognizing and managing bias. We also regularly survey employees on how effective our leadership has been in creating an inclusive workplace to discover new opportunities to build an inclusive community.\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nWe were incorporated as Maplebear Inc. in Delaware in 2012, and we do business as Instacart.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk because our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as further described below. You should consider and read carefully all of the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment \ndecision. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your original investment. You should not interpret our disclosure of any of the following risks to imply that such risks have not already materialized.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\n•Historical trends relating to our growth and financial performance may not be indicative of future performance.\n•If we fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or increase the engagement of our existing customers, including through effective marketing strategies, our business would be harmed.\n•We have a limited history operating our business at its current scale, scope, and complexity in an evolving market and economic environment, which makes it difficult to plan for future operations and strategic initiatives, predict future results, and evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\n•We have a history of losses, and we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability or generate profitable growth in the future.\n•The success of our business is dependent on our relationships with retailers. The loss of one or more of our retail partners or reduction in their engagement with Instacart could harm our business.\n•We are continuing to build our Instacart Ads offerings. If we fail to grow our advertising revenue, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be negatively impacted.\n•The markets in which we participate are highly and increasingly competitive, with well-capitalized and better-known competitors, some of which are also partners. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\n•If we fail to cost-effectively engage shoppers on Instacart, or attract and retain shoppers, our business could be harmed.\n•The failure to achieve increased market acceptance of online grocery shopping and our offerings could seriously harm our business.\n•Mergers or other strategic transactions by competitors or retailers could weaken our competitive position and adversely affect our business.\n•We expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations and operating cash flows to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\n•If the contractor status of shoppers who use Instacart is successfully challenged, or if additional requirements are placed on our engagement of independent contractors, we may face adverse business, financial, tax, legal, and other consequences.\n•The trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could decline significantly and rapidly. You may be unable to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price at which you purchased them.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nHistorical trends relating to our growth and financial performance may not be indicative of future performance.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in prior periods, which was driven substantially by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to significant demand for our offerings, and the rapid evolution of the online grocery shopping industry, as well as the other retail categories in which we operate. However, our growth rates have decreased from what we historically experienced and may continue to decrease or fluctuate as a result of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, including as a result of tariffs or other trade restrictions enacted by the United States and responses by foreign governments to such policies, increasing competition, strategic initiatives, and the maturation of our business, among others. We also cannot be certain whether we will drive greater engagement from new or existing retailers, customers, or brands or maintain or \nincrease the level of demand for our offerings over the long term. As a result of the foregoing, our prior growth rates and financial performance should not necessarily be considered indicative of our future performance and results of operations. \nOverall growth of our GTV, revenue, margin, and profitability depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n•attract new retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers, including through effective pricing of our offerings, and sustain and expand our relationships with existing retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers;\n•accurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses and investments for future growth;\n•successfully compete with other companies that are currently in, or may in the future enter, the markets in which we compete, and respond to developments from these competitors such as pricing changes and the introduction of new services;\n•hire, integrate, and retain talented sales, customer service, engineering, and other personnel;\n•comply with existing and new laws, regulations and judgments or settlements applicable to our business;\n•successfully expand in existing markets and enter new markets, including new geographies, adjacent retail categories, and new fulfillment methods;\n•increase the adoption of our Instacart+ membership program to drive increased customer engagement;\n•successfully launch new offerings and enhance Instacart and its features and use cases, including in response to new trends or competitive dynamics or the needs of retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers;\n•increase the revenue generated by our Instacart Ads offerings;\n•successfully identify, acquire and integrate, or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our offerings;\n•enter into and maintain strategic partnerships, including our partnership with Uber to offer their restaurant delivery services on our platform;\n•avoid interruptions or disruptions in our services;\n•provide retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers with high-quality support that meets their needs;\n•effectively manage growth of our infrastructure, personnel, and operations, particularly due to our Flex First workforce model that permits employees to elect to work remotely;\n•effectively manage our costs related to our fulfillment methods; and\n•maintain and enhance our reputation and the value of our brand.\nAs a result, you should not rely on our GTV, revenue growth rate, or other key business metrics for any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance.\nIn addition, our ability to forecast, and to provide guidance to investors regarding future operating results and key financial metrics is inherently uncertain. Our business is complex, relatively young and subject to significant impacts from events or evolving regulations beyond our control. All forecasts should be viewed as our good faith expectation at the time originally made, but not accorded undue weight.\nWe also expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources to grow our business, which may not result in sufficient growth or increased profitability to offset the cost of such investments. We may also fail to allocate our resources in a manner that results in increased GTV or revenue growth or improved margin. If our GTV or revenue growth rates decline or our margin is negatively impacted, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or increase the engagement of our existing customers, including through effective marketing strategies, our business would be harmed.\nThe growth of our business is dependent upon our ability to continue to grow our offerings by cost-effectively increasing our engagement with existing customers and acquiring new customers. If we fail to do so, the value of our offerings will be diminished, and we may have difficulty attracting and engaging retailers and brands. The number of \ncustomers and their level of engagement on Instacart may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including, among other things:\n•dissatisfaction with the operation of, or pricing on, Instacart, including our customer support services, or the quality and performance of the offerings, services, and technology of our partners;\n•the actual or perceived quality of service provided by shoppers, such as picking the wrong item, making a poor substitution for out of stock items, failing to deliver items on a timely basis or at all, failing to complete requested tasks or otherwise follow customer instructions, or customers having negative experiences in their interactions with shoppers, particularly during demand surges;\n•cost of using Instacart, including customer fees, compared to in-store shopping or other alternatives, particularly for lower income consumers;\n•the actual or perceived value or quality of our membership offering and membership benefits;\n•the actual or perceived value or quality of service, or the quality, pricing, and availability of products provided by retailers;\n•the breadth and variety of retailers that are available to customers on Instacart, including retailers with whom we have a limited or informal arrangement for availability on Instacart;\n•macroeconomic uncertainty, including as a result of tariffs or other trade restrictions enacted by the United States and responses by foreign governments to such policies;\n•future public health outbreaks, or a future outbreak of disease or similar public health concern;\n•market acceptance of online grocery shopping;\n•negative publicity related to our brand, including as a result of safety incidents and other events;\n•actual or perceived public policy positions;\n•failure to maintain good relationships with shoppers resulting in fewer shoppers available for customers, particularly during peak demand; or\n•dissatisfaction with the user experience on our platform, new and current offerings, or changes we make to our offerings.\nAlthough we believe that many customers originate from word-of-mouth customer acquisition and other non-paid referrals, we expect to continue to expend resources for customer acquisition and engagement, including through offering discounts and running promotions, all of which could impact our overall profitability. We have, in the past, experienced and may continue to experience decreases in new customer acquisition rates and customer retention which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact GTV and orders. As a result, we have increased and may continue to increase our customer acquisition spend, including incentives, paid marketing, and brand marketing campaigns to acquire new customers and increase the engagement of our existing customers, which may harm our margin and profitability and our efforts to drive efficiencies in our operating expenses. If we are not successful in, or reduce our marketing investments, we may not be able to retain our existing customers or convert first-time customers, including those using consumer incentives such as discount promotions, into customers who regularly use and engage with our offerings. Further, we may not be able to accurately assess the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and strategies in acquiring new customers or increasing existing customer engagement for several periods. The effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and strategies may also be obfuscated due to temporary or periodic external factors, such as future public health outbreaks, macroeconomic factors, and changes in the regulatory landscape. Failure to effectively design and conduct such campaigns and strategies may negatively impact our ability to acquire new customers and increase engagement with existing customers, which would harm our revenue growth and business. Consumers also have different grocery needs and preferences depending on demographics, and these priorities may shift as they age. We face heavy competition for consumers in certain demographics, including those in younger age groups who prioritize use cases, features, and fulfillment options that are different from customers in older age groups, such as convenience and specific product categories, as well as those in different income groups who may prioritize affordability over convenience or selection. If we do not successfully address the current and future needs of consumers in different demographics, primarily certain age and income groups, including through brand marketing campaigns and introduction and promotion of relevant use cases, features, fulfillment options, and other functionalities, we may be unable to attract new customers or increase engagement \nwith existing customers. In addition, we may also experience increased customer churn, including to competitors, which would harm our business.\nMany customers initially access Instacart to take advantage of certain promotions, such as discounts and other reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our offerings to such customers, thereby encouraging them to access Instacart regularly or subscribe to Instacart+, through prompts, notifications, and reduced fees or time-limited trials of Instacart+ and other offerings. However, these customers or other customers we acquire inorganically may be lower intent users of Instacart with reduced engagement compared to customers that we acquire organically, may never convert to paying Instacart+ members, or may discontinue using Instacart after they take advantage of our promotions. Further, our initiatives to retain customers, such as encouraging them to subscribe to Instacart+ or providing additional use cases and fulfillment options, may result in negative impacts to other metrics. For example, an increase in Instacart+ orders, changes in product categories shopped, reduced spend on more premium or discretionary products, a shift toward convenience or priority, may result in a decrease in average order value. Such shifts may also negatively impact certain retailers’ and brands’ actual or perceived benefit from engaging with Instacart. We may also fail to retain customers or experience reduced demand for our services due to negative impacts to our reputation and brand, including due to complaints and negative publicity about us, our offerings, or our competitors, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. For example, if we are unable to increase shopper availability during demand surges, including due to inclement weather or future public health outbreaks, customers may experience delays in receiving orders or incorrect order fulfillment, which may harm our brand and reputation. In addition, inventory shortages at our retail partners’ stores, which are not within our control, may also negatively impact consumers’ perception of our offerings. In particular, disruptions in the global supply chain, including those resulting from labor shortages or disputes, closures of manufacturing facilities, transportation restrictions and limitations, war and international conflicts, and increased demand for certain consumer products, have limited, and may continue to limit, the ability of our retail partners to obtain products, maintain stock of such products in a timely and cost-efficient manner, and otherwise respond to consumer demands. Although we do not carry grocery or other retail products as inventory, and as a result, we are not directly impacted by supply chain disruptions to those products, shortages of such products have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, higher rates of out of stock items and delivery delays by shoppers, which have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, more customer cancellations and redeliveries, fewer customer orders or smaller orders, and overall customer dissatisfaction.\nWe regularly provide customers with appeasement credits and refunds as well as incentives for future orders, which measures are intended to counteract any reputational harm and maintain customer satisfaction but are accounted for as direct reductions to our transaction revenue. These negative impacts to our revenue have harmed, and may continue to harm, our margin and results of operations, and the related customer dissatisfaction negatively impacts customer retention and engagement as well as our ability to continue growing our orders, GTV, and Instacart+ adoption. These negative impacts particularly harm our ability to engage with and retain customers in demographic groups that are historically less prevalent on Instacart, such as lower income customers, who may attribute less value to Instacart compared to alternatives due to these negative impacts. Efforts to reduce the overall costs associated with these appeasement credits and refunds, including by reducing appeasement credits and refunds generally, may also create reputational harm and impact our ability to attract or retain customers. Failure to retain existing customers or acquire new customers may also harm our relationships and commercial arrangements with retailers and brands as well as our ability to attract new retailer and brand partners. Past and future changes to the fees that we charge our customers may also reduce overall engagement by our customers or negatively impact new customer acquisition. If we are not able to continue to expand our customer base or fail to retain or drive greater engagement of customers or increase demand for our full-price or paid services, such as Instacart+, while balancing the interests of other constituents on Instacart, our revenue may grow slower than expected or decline, and our margin may be negatively impacted.\nWe have a limited history operating our business at its current scale, scope, and complexity in an evolving market and economic environment, which makes it difficult to plan for future operations and strategic initiatives, predict future results, and evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\nWe have significantly scaled and expanded our business and operations, which has led to increased usage of our offerings from new and existing customers. Accordingly, we have limited experience in, and data and results from, operating our business at its current scale, scope, and complexity and in a rapidly evolving market and economic environment. As a result, our ability to plan for future operations and strategic initiatives, predict future results of operations, and plan for and model future growth in orders, GTV, revenue, expenses and prospects is subject to significant risk and uncertainty as compared to companies with longer and more consistent operating histories and in more stable macroeconomic or regulatory environments and industries. In particular, we face risks and challenges relating to our ability to, among other things:\n•accurately forecast our orders, GTV, and revenue and budget for and manage our expenses;\n•attract new retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers and retain or increase the engagement of existing retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers in a cost-effective manner;\n•enter into and maintain strategic partnerships, including our partnership with Uber to offer their restaurant delivery services on our platform;\n•comply with existing and new laws, regulations and judgments or settlements applicable to our business;\n•plan for and manage capital expenditures;\n•anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate, including as a result of tariffs or other trade restrictions enacted by the United States and responses by foreign governments to such policies;\n•maintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\n•effectively manage our growth as the market for online grocery shopping continues to evolve;\n•effectively deploy our capital toward strategic initiatives;\n•successfully expand our geographic reach;\n•hire, integrate, and retain talented people at all levels of our organization; and\n•successfully maintain and enhance our offerings and our technology infrastructure for retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers.\nOur future growth will depend heavily on our ability to successfully execute on our strategic initiatives. For example, as we continue to expand our business, we have introduced and scaled new features, use cases (such as convenience and restaurants), fulfillment options (such as pickup and priority), and functionalities in our offerings (such as flyers and loyalty programs), and made strategic investments in new technologies and initiatives (such as Connected Stores and our enterprise offerings). We have also invested heavily in our Instacart Ads product capabilities and in growing the number of brands that use our services. In addition, we continue to invest in strategic initiatives such as Instacart Business and Instacart Health to expand the scope of our business. Our future growth depends on the perceived value of our expanded offerings as a whole to retailers, customers, brands, shoppers, and strategic partners, as well as our ability to balance the effects of various strategic initiatives, including our focus on further scaling our operations to improve our margin and profitability. For example, we may experience fluctuations in our growth due to changes in average order value as a result of promoting Instacart+ to customers to increase customer loyalty and order volume, new or updates to our pricing strategy or other strategic initiatives. We have limited experience operating this expanded business model and may not be able to accurately predict and plan for the impacts it may have on our growth rates, revenue mix, margin and profitability, as well as outside factors that may impact our business model, such as changes in consumer shopping behavior, retailer preferences, competition, and macroeconomic factors.\nOur limited history and experience operating our current business may also negatively impact our ability to plan strategic investments and initiatives to further expand our business and offerings, including to support our retail partners, customers, brand partners, and shoppers, certain of which may require significant capital expenditures and future operating expenses that may be difficult to forecast. In addition, existing and future operational and strategic initiatives may have lengthy return on investment time horizons, such as brand marketing campaigns, new marketing, merchandising and consumer awareness strategies, and Connected Stores. As a result, we will not be able to adequately assess the benefits of such initiatives until we have made substantial investments of time and capital, resulting in high opportunity costs. The online grocery industry and competitive landscape also continue to evolve, which will require us to address shifting competitive pressures and further stresses our ability to plan for operational and strategic initiatives and forecast our future results of operations. We are also devoting significant resources to bolster our capacity and information technology infrastructure, financial and accounting systems and controls, sales and marketing and engineering capabilities, and operations and support infrastructure, as well as to retain, manage, and train employees in geographically dispersed locations to service new and existing customers. We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives in a timely manner or at all.\nYou should consider and evaluate our prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by growing companies in rapidly evolving markets, in particular, markets that are or could be materially impacted by significant regulatory changes, global pandemics, and economic recessions such as the online grocery industry. If our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties that we consider in planning and operating our business are incorrect or\nchange, or if we do not address these risks and uncertainties successfully, including due to the lack of historical data from and experience in operating our business at its current scale, scope, and complexity, the continued evolution of our business and the online grocery industry, or other factors, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability or generate profitable growth in the future.\nAlthough we have generated profit in recent periods, including net income of $457 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, we have historically experienced significant net losses, including a net loss of $1,622 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of stock-based compensation expense we recognized in connection with the vesting of certain restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and vesting of restricted stock in connection with our IPO. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $3,585 million. We will need to sustain or increase revenue while managing our costs to sustain or increase profitability.\nOur ability to generate and expand profitability is highly impacted by growth in our diversified revenue streams and our ability to drive operational efficiencies in our business. Our efforts to maintain and increase our profitability may not succeed due to factors such as evolving consumer behavior trends in grocery shopping, including the impacts of future public health outbreaks, customer engagement and retention, changes in our revenue mix and retailer, customer, and brand partner fees, the costs associated with complying with evolving regulatory regimes, including costs associated with order fulfillment, collection and credit risks, our ability to hire and retain highly skilled personnel, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, our ability to effectively scale our operations, and the continuing evolution of the online grocery industry, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur ability to generate and expand profitability also depends on our ability to manage our costs. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources to:\n•increase the engagement of retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers;\n•drive adoption of our offerings through marketing and incentives and increase awareness through brand campaigns;\n•enhance Instacart with new offerings, including through partnerships, use cases, features, including flyers and loyalty programs, fulfillment options, member benefits, such as unlimited $0 delivery fees on orders over a certain size, and other exclusive benefits for Instacart+ members, and functionality, including through strategic investments and expanded technologies, such as Connected Stores; and\n•invest in our operations to continue scaling our business to achieve and sustain long-term efficiencies.\nThese investments may contribute to net losses in the near term. We may discover that these initiatives are more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses or realize the benefits we anticipate. Certain initiatives may also require incremental investments or recurring expenses and may not be accretive to revenue growth, margin, or profitability for a longer time period, if at all. Many of our efforts to increase revenue and manage operating costs are new and unproven given the unique and evolving complexities of our business and the evolving nature of the grocery industry. Any failure to adequately increase revenue or manage operating costs could prevent us from sustaining or increasing profitability. Expansion of our offerings, such as to include new use cases, additional technologies, fulfillment options, additional geographic markets, or retail categories adjacent to grocery, may initially harm our profitability. We have also made and may continue to make concessions to retailers that are designed to maximize profitability in the long term but may decrease profitability in the short term. These retailer concessions negatively impact our revenue and financial results and the process for determining and quantifying the impact of these concessions requires judgment and estimates. As a result, the impact of retailer concessions on our financial results may continue into future periods or have higher impacts than we anticipate. We may also incur higher operating expenses as we implement strategic initiatives, including in response to external pressures such as competition, retailer consolidation, and evolving consumer behavior trends in grocery shopping. For example, our sales and marketing expenses as well as consumer incentive costs have increased and may continue to increase in the near term. Additionally, we may not realize, or there may be limits to, the efficiencies we expect to achieve through our efforts to scale the business, reduce friction in the shopping experience, and optimize costs such as shopper earnings, payment processing, customer and shopper support, and shopper acquisition and onboarding costs. We have expanded gross margin and optimized operating costs through these efficiencies in the past but the pace of such expansion has normalized and may decelerate further in the \nfuture. We also face greater compliance costs associated with the increased scope of our business and being a public company.\nIn addition, we have granted RSUs and restricted stock to our employees and directors, which primarily vest upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition. Stock-based compensation expense related to these RSUs and other outstanding equity awards will result in fluctuations in our expenses in future periods.\nWe may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other factors, including as we expand our business, execute on strategic initiatives, and navigate macroeconomic uncertainty and any future public health concerns or outbreaks, which may result in losses or a failure to generate or expand profitable growth in future periods.\nAs such, due to these factors and others described in this “Risk Factors” section, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability or generate profitable growth in the future. If we are unable to sustain or increase profitability, the value of our business and the trading price of our common stock may be negatively impacted.\nThe success of our business is dependent on our relationships with retailers. The loss of one or more of our retail partners or reduction in their engagement with Instacart could harm our business.\nIn order to attract and expand our relationships with consumers, brands, and shoppers, we must attract new retailers and maintain our relationships with existing retailers. Consumers have strong preferences for their favorite retailers due to the trust these brands have created over generations, and our ability to increase consumer and brand adoption of Instacart depends on our ability to maintain our retail partners and maintain or increase their adoption of our offerings.\nOur ability to attract and retain retailers depends on our ability to generate revenue for them. Retailers will not continue to do business with us if they do not believe that partnering with Instacart will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, including from our competitors. Retailers have in the past chosen, and could continue to choose, to partner with other online grocery platforms (exclusively or otherwise) or develop or acquire their own online grocery platforms, in either case in a specific geographic market or overall. Retailers may also choose to develop, acquire, or partner with other companies (exclusively or otherwise) for access to products and offerings for specific use cases, fulfillment options, features, or technologies, such as brand advertising and retail media platforms, prepared meals, shopping cart or checkout technologies, and others. Our future growth depends in part on our ability to not only engage new retailers but also to retain and expand existing retailer engagement with Instacart. However, retailers may decrease their engagement with Instacart based on factors that may not be within our control or whose impacts are difficult to predict. For example, macroeconomic effects from supply shortages and inflation have previously resulted in fluctuations in consumer shopping behaviors and preferences. An increase in retailer operating costs, or other deterioration in the financial condition of retailers, whether due to macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, could cause retailers to raise prices, renegotiate contract terms, or cease operations, which we expect may influence our retailer fee terms. Further, as we expand our own offerings, changes in the mix of customer engagement with our existing and new use cases, fulfillment options, features, and technologies, as well as any changes in online shopping behaviors, may also result in a decrease in engagement for certain retailers, due to less favorable economics or changes in retailers’ strategic focus. We may not be able to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the factors above on our business and growth initiatives and resulting new trends in retailer strategies and preferences, including due to our limited experience in operating our business at its current scale, scope, and complexity and limited historical data regarding impacts of these factors, which may harm our revenue growth, margin, and results of operations.\nWe enter into services agreements with our retail partners that provide for service fees in exchange for providing access to our technology platform. We recognize revenue as a percentage of the total purchase value from the sale of goods, a per transaction fee, the difference in price between amounts charged to customers for goods and the actual settlement price to the retailer for the goods, a license fee for the use of our technology platform, or a combination thereof. Payment by retailers is generally due immediately to 45 days upon receipt of invoice. Retailers have in the past decided and may in the future decide to not renew their agreements while others have in the past modified and may in the future modify their agreement terms in a cost-prohibitive or strategically detrimental manner when their agreements are up for renewal due to factors such as macroeconomic uncertainty, dissatisfaction with existing or proposed terms in their service agreements, changes in consumer shopping behavior and preferences on Instacart and among our use cases, fulfillment options, and competitive offerings. For example, we have modified, and may need to modify in the future, retailer fee arrangements to attract and retain retailers, modify payment processing arrangements, or make other changes that reduce our transaction revenue, in each case due to competition, retailer business downturns, and other factors. Some retailers have \nin the past shifted and may in the future shift away from exclusive arrangements with us for various reasons, including to partner with other or additional online grocery platforms, and additional retailers may decide to shift away from such arrangements in the future. Our inability to maintain our relationships with retailers on terms consistent with or better than those already in place and that are otherwise favorable to us could increase competitive pressure, impact grocery product and/or offering pricing, and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Retailer consolidation may also result in a decrease in or cessation of engagement with Instacart, or result in Instacart receiving less favorable contract terms with the consolidated entity.\nRetailers could also experience downturns or fail, including due to macroeconomic pressures, experience labor shortages or disputes, fail to adopt additional offerings or fulfillment methods or fail to launch or utilize our offerings in the manner and timing that we expect, or cease using Instacart altogether for many reasons. The grocery industry has traditionally been slow to adopt new technologies, fulfillment options, and online enablement in general, including due to lack of confidence in the online grocery industry, preference for in-store shopping due to resulting organic shopping behaviors, or general resistance to adopting Instacart, and is typically characterized by comparatively lower margin and high cash needs. As a result, we have at times experienced, and may continue to experience, slower adoption and implementation of our offerings by our retail partners as well as retailer turnover. If we lack a sufficient variety and supply of retailers, or lack access to the most popular retailers, such that Instacart becomes less appealing to consumers and brands, our business may be harmed.\nWe currently generate significant GTV and revenue from a small number of retailers. Our top three retailers accounted for approximately 43% of our GTV for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, and 42% for the year ended December 31, 2024. While GTV and revenue from our largest retail partners may decrease as a percent of our total GTV and revenue over time as we generate more GTV and revenue from other retailers, we believe that GTV and revenue from our largest retailers will continue to account for a significant portion of our GTV and revenue for the foreseeable future. If any of these retailers were to suspend, limit, or cease their operations or otherwise terminate their relationships with us, the attractiveness of Instacart to consumers and brands could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are continuing to build our Instacart Ads offerings. If we fail to grow our advertising revenue, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be negatively impacted.\nWe are continuing to build, grow, and scale our Instacart Ads offerings and our advertising revenue model. Our agreements with brand partners provide that service fees are paid for continually promoting a brand during the duration of the term applicable to a given advertising campaign. Contracts applicable to a given advertising campaign are typically less than one year in duration. We primarily recognize revenue in the amount that we have the right to invoice as advertising services are rendered, which occurs upon delivery of clicks, upon delivery of impressions, over the contract term on a fixed fee basis, or upon redemption of coupons. Payment for our advertising offerings is generally due 30 to 90 days upon receipt of invoice. Although we have significantly grown our advertising and other revenue and launched a number of new advertising capabilities in recent years, we are still optimizing and refining the execution of our growth strategy for our Instacart Ads offerings and face certain challenges associated with scaling such newer offerings. As such, there is no assurance that this advertising revenue model will continue to be successful or that we will generate increasing advertising revenue, and the pace of expansion of our Ads offerings may fluctuate. To sustain or increase our advertising revenue, we must attract new brands and encourage existing brands to maintain or increase their advertising spend on Instacart given we do not typically have long-term commitments from brands. To do this, we must expand the number of markets where we offer advertising, attract new retailers and expand our relationships with existing retailers, acquire new customers and increase the engagement of existing customers, and increase the breadth and functionality of our advertising products to create more value for our brand partners, including new advertising formats, new measurement tools, increased brand awareness, and other capabilities to deliver attractive return on investment to brand partners. If we are unable or choose not to expand our advertising markets, develop or pursue innovative advertising models and offerings, expand our relationships with more retailers, acquire new customers or increase the engagement of existing customers, or acquire new brand partners or increase the engagement of existing brand partners, we may not be able to successfully grow our advertising and other revenue. In addition, our advertising and other revenue growth rate and our advertising and other investment rate have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, particularly during periods of acceleration or deceleration in our GTV growth. Our advertising and other investment rate may also fluctuate if we generate more GTV from sources where we do not provide advertising or where we have recently enabled advertising, such as from certain new offerings or use cases and from retailers’ owned and operated online storefronts including those utilizing Instacart API that do not partner with Carrot Ads.\nChanges to our advertising policies and privacy, data security, and data protection practices, laws, legislation, or regulations, or the regulatory enforcement thereof, may affect the products that we are able to provide to brands, which could harm our business. Actions by operating system platform providers or application stores such as Apple or Google may also affect our offerings or services or how we collect, use, and share data from end-user devices in connection with Instacart Ads. For example, Apple implemented a requirement for applications using its mobile operating system, iOS, to affirmatively (on an opt-in basis) obtain an end user’s permission to track user activity across apps or websites or access users’ device advertising identifiers for advertising and advertising measurement purposes, as well as other restrictions. Additionally, many state legislatures have enacted laws and regulations granting consumers the right to opt-out of a company’s sharing of personal data for advertising purposes in exchange for money or other valuable consideration and imposing certain obligations on covered businesses with respect to consumers’ personal data. Partially as a result of these developments, individuals are becoming increasingly resistant to the collection, use, and sharing of personal data to deliver targeted advertising. Individuals are now more aware of options related to consent, “do not track” mechanisms (such as browser signals from the Global Privacy Control), and “ad-blocking” software to prevent the collection of their personal data for targeted advertising purposes. The long-term impact of these and other privacy and regulatory changes remains uncertain and may harm our growth, business, and profitability.\nIn addition, expenditures by brands tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions have also adversely affected the demand for advertising and caused brands to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising. For example, we have seen and may continue to see reduced demand for advertising from brands that are exercising caution with their spending budgets and either slowing or reducing their campaigns due to, among other things, macroeconomic uncertainty, including as a result of tariffs or other trade restrictions enacted by the United States and responses by foreign governments to such policies, global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages or disputes, changing consumer preferences, geopolitical conflicts including the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, and reduced consumer confidence. These factors have had a negative impact on our advertising revenue, and such impact is expected to continue in future periods. These factors may also negatively impact our ability to forecast our advertising revenue as the extent of the ongoing impact of these macroeconomic factors on our business and on global economic activity generally is uncertain and may continue to adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results. In addition, impacts to brand partner spend as a result of decreases in our GTV growth, along with the timing of adoption of new advertising formats and offerings, have resulted and may continue to result in reductions in the growth of brand partner digital marketing spend on Instacart and related decreases in advertising and other revenue growth in future periods. Our ability to sustain or increase profitability depends in part on our advertising revenue, and failure to maintain or grow our advertising revenue could harm our prospects, business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as impact our ability to strategically lower fees and invest in larger marketing campaigns, new offerings, and select geographic expansions.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly and increasingly competitive, with well-capitalized and better-known competitors, some of which are also partners. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\nThe markets in which we compete are evolving rapidly and are highly competitive with increasing competitive pressure. Our business is complex and encompasses a range of technologies, offering types, and fulfillment methods that serve the diverse needs of our constituents.\nWith respect to Instacart Marketplace, our current and potential competitors include, but are not limited to: (i) existing and well-established online grocery or shopping alternatives, including digital-first platforms, such as Amazon and Thrive Market, (ii) brick-and-mortar retailers that have their own digital and fulfillment offerings, such as Target and Walmart, some of which decide to partner with Instacart to complement their own offerings, (iii) companies that provide e-commerce and fulfillment services for third parties, including retailers, whether online or offline, such as DoorDash, Shipt (acquired by Target), and Uber Eats, (iv) digital-first platforms entering the grocery market by owning inventory, including DashMart (owned by DoorDash), Fresh Direct (owned by Getir), and Gopuff, which may include existing retailers on Instacart, which could eventually eliminate their need to partner with us or limit their use of Instacart Marketplace, (v) companies that provide e-commerce and fulfillment services that focus on discrete categories of products, such as alcohol or prescription delivery, including Alto Pharmacy, and (vi) companies that offer direct to consumer ingredient or meal offerings, such as Blue Apron (owned by Wonder Group) or Misfits Market, some of which may partner with Instacart to complement their own offerings. Most consumers currently choose to shop for themselves at brick-and-mortar grocery stores, regardless of whether we partner with the retailers that operate these stores. Also, the cost to switch between providers of online grocery shopping is low for consumers, and consumers within various demographics have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider and may use more than one platform.\nWith respect to Instacart Enterprise Platform, our current and potential competitors include, but are not limited to: (i) companies that are focused on the online grocery enterprise services industry, as well as larger enterprise software companies that have products and services that provide retailers with some of the benefits we offer through Instacart Enterprise Platform, (ii) micro-fulfillment or automated warehouse providers that support grocery retailers’ owned and operated offerings, such as Ocado, and (iii) existing and potential retailers on Instacart who develop or may in the future develop their own enterprise e-commerce system. In addition, our competitors include companies that provide point solutions for individual components of Instacart’s e-commerce offering such as picking technology and retail media network solutions. Our competitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic relationships among themselves or with others, including retailers. While there may be costs to switch between enterprise products, retailers may shift to the platform that offers the lowest service fee for their products and provides the highest volume of orders, or build their own. Our Instacart Enterprise Platform also includes in-store technology offerings, including Caper Carts, Lists, Carrot Tags, and other in-store applications, which face competition from other retailer technology solution providers, such as Veeve and Amazon.\nWith respect to Instacart Ads, our current and potential competitors include, but are not limited to: (i) third-party platforms that assist retailers with monetization of their digital offerings for consumers, such as CitrusAd (acquired by Publicis Groupe), Criteo, and Quotient, (ii) first-party retailer-owned solutions that provide online advertising opportunities to brands on their owned and operated domains, such as Amazon, Kroger, Target, Walmart, and others, some of which are also retailers on Instacart, (iii) companies that provide e-commerce and fulfillment services for third parties, including retailers, which currently offer or may in the future offer advertising products, such as DoorDash and Uber Eats, and (iv) companies that offer established online advertising products that are not specifically limited to the grocery industry, such as those offered by Amazon, Google, Meta, and Snap.\nWith respect to restaurants offered on Instacart’s Marketplace via our partnership with Uber, there are a number of competitors to such offering available through Instacart including, but not limited to: (i) local on-demand delivery companies such as DoorDash, Uber Eats via Uber’s native applications, and Grubhub (acquired by Wonder), (ii) restaurants that have their own online ordering platform or online ordering systems, and (iii) other businesses that offer online ordering of prepared meals. Many consumers also rely on offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus advertised by restaurants to consumers. The cost to switch between providers of online restaurant delivery is low for consumers, and consumers within various demographics have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider and may use more than one delivery platform. In addition, competitors may offer different restaurant selection or restaurant delivery focused memberships that discourage consumers from switching to our offering. \nWe also compete for shoppers with many of the same companies with which we compete for customers, as well as companies in industries unrelated to ours that offer personal task-based services. The majority of shoppers do not shop on Instacart as their primary occupation or source of income. As such, a shopper, or someone considering to be a shopper, weighs that opportunity against others, such as traditional employment, personal task-based services, school, personal time, or other options in the labor market. Because switching costs are low, shoppers may shift to another platform that has higher, or is perceived to have higher, earnings potential.\nFurther, while we work to expand further in the United States and Canada and scale international markets, and introduce new offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings, and as existing offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. If we are unable to offer comparable or superior offerings, our business may be adversely affected. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our features, or may adopt innovations that consumers value more highly than ours, which would render our offerings less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our offerings.\nMany of our competitors are well-capitalized and are able to offer discounted or free services, shopper incentives, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative products and offerings, and alternative pricing models, which may be more attractive to retailers, consumers, brands, or shoppers than those that we offer. In addition, we may not be able to effectively compete with service offerings from vertically integrated competitors, such as Amazon or Gopuff, which control both the brick-and-mortar retailer and online fulfillment technology. Certain brick-and-mortar retailers that have their own digital offering, such as Walmart, also have significant size, scale, geographic, and customer base advantages, which may allow them to grow online sales or capture increasing share of the online grocery market or advertising budgets more effectively and at a faster rate than us. Competitors may also offer fulfillment options from our retail partners, despite \nhaving no formal engagement with such retailers. Further, some of our current or potential competitors have, and may in the future continue to have, greater resources and access to larger consumer and shopper bases in a particular geographic area. In addition, our competitors in certain geographies enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, better localized knowledge, and/or fewer regulatory challenges. Smaller competitors may be more nimble at anticipating and meeting changing market dynamics and new entrants to online grocery are able to initially grow grocery sales at a faster rate due to their smaller scale, which has attracted advertising budget to certain of these competitors. As a result, such competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than us in such markets to new or changing opportunities, technologies, consumer preferences, regulations, or standards, which may render our offerings less attractive. In addition, future competitors may share in the effective benefit of any regulatory or governmental approvals and litigation victories we may achieve, without having to incur the costs we have incurred to obtain such benefits.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors. Our inability to compete effectively would have an adverse effect on our ability to acquire new retailers, customers, and brand partners or increase the engagement of our existing retailers, customers, and brand partners, or would otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Third parties may also gather, collect, or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveal competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively engage shoppers on Instacart, or attract and retain shoppers, our business could be harmed.\nShoppers perform certain tasks for customers, including picking and delivering goods, on Instacart. We enter into agreements with shoppers for them to provide fulfillment and other services to customers through Instacart and our technology. Our agreements with shoppers generally remain in effect until terminated by the shopper or by us. Shoppers may generally terminate their agreements with us at any time by providing us written notice and such agreements do not provide for any exclusivity.\nIf there are not enough shoppers on Instacart, customer orders may be late, may go unfulfilled, or may be incorrectly fulfilled, which would have a negative effect on those impacted customers and retailers and consequently on our business. If there are too many shoppers on Instacart, there may be an insufficient number of customers placing orders to keep shoppers occupied, engaged, and satisfied with their earnings potential on Instacart. If we are unable to attract shoppers on favorable terms or increase utilization of Instacart by existing shoppers, if we lose shoppers on Instacart, or if shoppers determine it is no longer economically worthwhile to provide services on Instacart due to factors that may be beyond our control, including the costs of gasoline, vehicles, or insurance, changes in consumer behaviors in grocery shopping, actual or perceived economic advantages of providing services with other companies that engage independent contractors, including our competitors, our growth objectives and our business and prospects could be seriously harmed.\nThe number of shoppers on Instacart could decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including shoppers choosing not to provide their services through Instacart as a result of being dissatisfied with their earnings potential, our pay model or changes to our pay model, changes to the terms of our independent contractor agreement, shopper incentives, our retail partners, having a poor experience on Instacart, or deciding to pursue other work opportunities. For example, shoppers may prefer to provide services through other companies that engage independent contractors if these companies provide benefits such as insurance or portable benefit accounts, or if shoppers simply prefer other app-based work opportunities, such as passenger transportation or restaurant delivery, for non-economic reasons. Many shoppers provide services part-time and have other independent contracting work or employment. Factors outside of our control, including macroeconomic factors, and improvements in labor markets, may cause shoppers to cease providing services on Instacart and become employees elsewhere. Shopper dissatisfaction has in the past resulted in shopper protests, coordinated shopper work stoppages, shoppers choosing not to provide their services through Instacart, and negative press. Any protests, work stoppages or refusals to provide services may result in interruptions to our business or negative publicity and may otherwise harm our business and reputation. While we have implemented strategic initiatives and commitments to bolster our reputation with shoppers in the past, and intend to continue implementing such initiatives and commitments in the future, there can be no assurance that these will be effective to retain shoppers and maintain or improve our reputation with shoppers.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, shopper shortages, often due to factors that are not within our control and which may be difficult to predict. Shoppers have significant flexibility regarding the in-store tasks they want to perform, including when, where, and how they wish to shop. Shoppers may also provide services on other app-based platforms. To the extent that we experience shopper shortages, we may need to provide or increase \nincentives to shoppers in order to attract them to Instacart, which would negatively impact our financial results. Our expectations and predictions for shopper needs and preferences may also be inaccurate or incomplete, including due to a lack of historical data for our current scale and scope of operations or due to consumer demand surges that can arise due to factors outside of our control, such as inclement weather. Under these circumstances, we may not be able to attract enough shoppers to fulfill orders in a timely manner even with shopper incentives. Consequently, if shopper shortages lead to the inability of customers to place orders through Instacart or to delayed or incorrect orders, we may lose customers to other online grocery platforms or to other modes of shopping, particularly customers in certain demographic groups who have historically been less prevalent users of Instacart and are more difficult to engage or retain, which would harm our growth, profitability, and results of operations. Finally, the loss of customer orders due to a lack of shoppers to fulfill them or due to incorrect order fulfillment may reduce the perceived value of our offerings to retailers, who may in turn leave Instacart.\nIn addition, authorities have passed laws or adopted regulations, and may continue to do so in the future, requiring shoppers in the applicable jurisdiction to undergo a materially different type of qualification, training, licensure, screening, or background check process, which could be costly and time-consuming. These laws have also in the past imposed and may in the future impose requirements forcing us to fix minimum levels of compensation and provide certain benefits for shoppers, disclose additional details about orders, prices, and shopper earnings, and handle shopper account deactivation in a prescribed manner, which could force us to create new administrative processes and negatively affect our ability to attract and retain retailers, customers, or shoppers, as well as require us to share competitively sensitive information that may cause harm to our business. Court decisions interpreting or otherwise affecting such laws regarding shopper classification or shopper pay and benefits, or interpretations by agencies of the applicability of a retailer or brand collective bargaining agreement to certain tasks shoppers perform, may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain retailers, customers, or shoppers. Even if some or all of such changes are ultimately not costly or time-consuming, they could reduce the number of shoppers in those markets or extend the time required to recruit new shoppers to Instacart, which could adversely impact our growth, business, and results of operations.\nOften, we are forced to balance tradeoffs between the satisfaction of various constituents on Instacart, as a change that one category views as positive may be viewed as negative to another category. For example, we take certain measures that are designed to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security breaches, such as imposing certain qualifications for shoppers and terminating access to Instacart for shoppers with reported incidents, that may be popular with consumers but may also damage our relationships with shoppers or discourage or diminish their use of Instacart. Certain measures we take to incentivize shoppers, such as smaller windows for reducing tips after an order is complete, may be popular with shoppers but may also be viewed negatively by consumers who wish to have more flexibility over tipping. Further, increased shopper flexibility in when, where, and how to shop may result in shopper shortages during periods of peak demand, which may cause frustration with retailers and customers. If we do not adequately balance the tradeoffs among the various constituents on Instacart and continuously assess such tradeoffs in the context of prevailing market and competitive factors, our business may be harmed.\nThe failure to achieve increased market acceptance of online grocery shopping and our offerings could seriously harm our business.\nThe market acceptance of our offerings is critical to our continued success. Historically, consumers and retailers have been slower to adopt online grocery shopping than e-commerce offerings in other industries such as consumer electronics and apparel. Grocery is a complex market, and improving upon the traditional consumer in-store experience through an online platform or with connected shopping experiences is difficult due to broad consumer demands on selection, quality, affordability, and convenience. Grocery shopping habits and related consumer preferences are complex and diverse across and within markets and across demographics and age groups. Changing traditional grocery shopping habits is difficult, and if consumers and retailers do not embrace the transition to online grocery shopping and connected shopping experiences as we expect, our business and operations could be harmed. The amount of influence we may have over these shopping habits and preferences, and the methods at our disposal to exercise such influence (including marketing and incentives), may be limited, and we are dependent on external influences over shopping habits, such as public health incidents and inclement weather, and macroeconomic factors. In particular, shopping habits and preferences vary between younger and older consumers, consumers across different income groups, and among other demographic characteristics, and to be successful, we need to effectively increase market acceptance across all age, income, and other demographically different groups by increasing brand awareness and focusing marketing efforts on relevant habits and preferences. Moreover, even if more consumers begin to shop for groceries online, if we are unable to address their changing needs, or the evolving needs of retailers or brands, and anticipate or respond to market trends and new technologies in a timely and cost-efficient manner, we could experience decreased adoption, increased customer churn and lose the support of retailers and brands, any of which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. Demand for our offerings is also affected by a number \nof factors beyond our control, including macroeconomic conditions, initiatives by retailers to influence shopping behavior, continued market acceptance of our offerings, the timing of development and release of new offerings and features by us, the timing or manner of the adoption of our offerings by retailers and our competitors, changing consumer dietary preferences, technological change, brand recognition, and growth or contraction in our markets. If we fail to achieve increased market acceptance of our offerings, our business could be seriously harmed.\nMergers or other strategic transactions by competitors or retailers could weaken our competitive position and adversely affect our business.\nIf one or more competitors or retailers were to merge, acquire, or partner with another competitor or retailer, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Consolidation amongst major retail partners could impact contractual negotiations with such retail partners, result in lower utilization of our products, or lead ultimately to termination of existing retailer engagements. In addition, our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with current or future retailers, brands, and other parties with whom we have relationships, which could limit our ability to promote our offerings to those retailers and reduce our number of customers. As a result of these and future potential acquisitions, current and future retailers may begin working more closely, or on an exclusive basis, with other competitors with whom they have combined or otherwise established new relationships. Disruptions in our business caused by these events could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations and operating cash flows to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n•our ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan our expenses;\n•macroeconomic uncertainty, including as a result of tariffs or other trade restrictions enacted by the United States and responses by foreign governments to such policies;\n•the impact of prior or future public health threats on our business;\n•revenue and fulfillment option mix shifts as we enhance Instacart with new offerings, use cases, and functionality, as well as changes in mix of revenue contribution from advertising contracts;\n•timing of the recognition of our deferred revenue;\n•timing of strategic investments and expenditures;\n•fluctuations in operating expenses, including cost of revenue, as we seek to improve efficiencies, comply with changing regulatory requirements, and expand our business, offerings, and technologies;\n•changes to financial accounting standards and the interpretation of those standards, which may affect the way we recognize and report our financial results;\n•the effectiveness of our internal controls;\n•the seasonality of our business, including as a result of inclement weather; and\n•our ability to collect payments from retailers and brands on a timely basis.\nThe impact of one or more of the foregoing and other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly. In particular, we experienced substantial growth in recent periods and have also made significant changes to our business, including through scaling our operations to meet the increased demand and implementing new business and product initiatives, which have impacted our expenses and margin. These historical shifts and trends are not necessarily indicative of our future performance and may obscure longer term trends in our business and results of operations. Relatedly, even as the circumstances that accelerated the growth and evolution of our business subside, we may experience sudden periods of high demand and related increased costs due to future public health outbreaks. As such, for these and other factors stated above, quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be unduly relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nOur working capital and operating cash flows have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of new initiatives, the timing of payments made to and/or received from retailers, shoppers, and vendors, and certain transaction types, such as those involving EBT SNAP benefits and alcohol sales, which have a more significant impact on our working capital and operating cash flow due to the variability, magnitude, and timing of retailer reimbursements. Additionally, we make substantial weekly payments to shoppers on Tuesdays and Sundays for services delivered on Instacart, and therefore, we expect our reported cash and cash flows from operating activities to be impacted based on the day of the week of each reporting period. Additionally, due to the timing of funding to a certain payment card issuer, we may experience an increase in short-term liabilities based on the day of the week of the last day of each reporting period. Due to this timing, our cash flows from operating activities may not be directly comparable from period to period.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our sales and results of operations.\nWe experience seasonality in both the number of orders and GTV on Instacart, as well as in our advertising and other revenue. We typically see lower levels of order volume in the second and third quarter, resulting from lower usage of our offerings during the spring and summer months, followed by higher levels of order volume during the holiday season. In addition, during periods of inclement weather, the number of available shoppers generally decreases, while the number of orders from customers has typically increased, which may disrupt or obscure typical seasonal trends and make seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. In addition, our advertising and other revenue has historically been seasonally high in the fourth quarter and seasonally low in the first quarter in a given year as a result of how advertisers deploy their budgets. Seasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time if our growth slows, although growth in new offerings, such as restaurants, and disruptive events such as future public health outbreaks may obscure future seasonality trends. Moreover, other seasonal trends may develop, including from new offerings, or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, and the existing seasonality and customer and shopper behavior that we experience may change or become more significant, which would contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations.\nIf we or the third parties we rely on experience a compromise to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our or their systems, or to data of our customers, shoppers, partners, employees, or Instacart, we may experience adverse consequences, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits, loss of customers or sales, and other adverse consequences.\nOperating our business and platform involves the collection, use, storage, transmission, and other processing of sensitive, proprietary, and confidential information, including personal information of customers, shoppers, and personnel, our proprietary and confidential information, and the confidential information of partners including retailers and brands. Security incidents compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of this information or our IT systems or data (or those of third parties upon which we rely or otherwise engage with), or disrupting our ability (or that of third parties with whom we work) to provide our offerings, products, and/or services, could materially impact our business and results of operations. We face evolving cybersecurity threats and threat actors including but not limited to state-sponsored and advanced persistent threat actors, malicious code and malware (such as viruses, worms and ransomware), social engineering (including deep fakes, which may be increasingly difficult to identify as fake, and phishing), denial-of-service attacks, credential harvesting, credential stuffing, supply-chain attacks, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, security bugs, vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the software or systems on which we rely, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. In addition, malfeasance, error, theft, or misuse by our own personnel or the personnel of our strategic partners, our collaborators, or the third-party service providers with which we engage, of our intellectual property, financial data, or employee, retailer, customer, brand, or shopper data, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, particularly if such information is provided to or accessed by a competitor.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to operate our critical business systems and to process confidential and personal information, such as the payment processors that process customer credit card payments, cloud service providers, and employee and customer service centers, including those located in other countries. Our ability to require, monitor and enforce these third parties’ information security practices is limited. Because third parties provide operational support to our business and process confidential and personal information on our behalf, we could experience materially adverse consequences as a result of cyberattacks or incidents experienced by those third parties. Third party and supply chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity and we cannot guarantee that the security of our service providers or any of their partners has not been materially compromised. We also cannot be certain that our contracts with these third parties will allow us to obtain indemnification or recovery from them for data security-related liability that they cause us to incur.\nThreat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage, and are expected to continue to engage, in cyber-attacks, including for geopolitical reasons and in connection with military conflicts and operations. Due to the current geopolitical environment, we and the third parties upon which we rely are at heightened risk of these attacks, including cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell, and distribute our goods and services. In particular, severe ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of sensitive data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds.\nIn addition, remote work has increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as our employees utilize network connections, computers, and devices outside our premises or network, including working at home, while in transit, and in public locations. For example, technologies in our employees’ and service providers’ homes are often not as robust as in our offices and could cause the networks, information systems, applications, and other tools available to employees and service providers to be more limited or less reliable than in our offices. Further, the security systems in place at our employees’ and service providers’ homes, or other remote work locations, may be less secure than those used in our offices. There is no guarantee that the privacy, data security, and data protection safeguards we or our service providers have put in place will be comprehensive, or completely implemented, complied with, or effective. Additionally, future and past business transactions with other parties (such as acquisitions, strategic partnerships, collaborations, or integrations) have exposed us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities associated with those parties, such as security issues that were not identified during due diligence, and difficulty or incomplete integration of their systems into our information technology environment and security program.\nWe and certain of our third-party providers regularly experience cyberattacks and other security incidents, and we expect such attacks and incidents to continue. For example, we regularly experience credential stuffing attacks in which malicious third parties use credentials compromised in data breaches suffered by other companies or otherwise improperly obtain credentials to access shopper or customer accounts on Instacart, as well as sophisticated social engineering attacks that involve the installation of malware on our network and unauthorized access to and acquisition of information. It is increasingly difficult and costly to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a security incident. Actions taken by us or the third parties with whom we work to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a security incident could result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our business, which presents additional opportunities for threat actors to gain access to other networks and systems.\nWe take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information systems (such as our hardware and/or software, including that of third parties with whom we work). We are unable to comprehensively apply patches or confirm that measures are in place to mitigate all such vulnerabilities, or that patches will be applied before vulnerabilities are exploited, resulting in a security incident.\nWhile we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, we or the third parties we work with cannot anticipate, or implement adequate preventative measures to address all cybercrime and hacking techniques (including the use of artificial intelligence) used by threat actors, including those that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic artifacts. Cyberattacks and incidents may result in any or all of the following that could independently or in the aggregate cause a material adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and results of operations: loss of customer confidence in the security of Instacart and damage to our brand, reduced demand for our offerings, serious disruption of normal business operations, material diversion of resources to investigate and remediate incidents, exposure to legal liability, including through litigation (such as class actions), regulatory enforcement, and indemnity obligations. Further, applicable privacy, data security, and data protection obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of certain security incidents, including affected individuals, customers, regulators, and investors, or to take other actions, such as providing credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences, including potential statutory damages under laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). We have expended and may in the future expend significant resources or modify our business activities to try to protect against security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations have required us to implement and maintain specific security measures or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and sensitive information. These risks are expected to increase as we continue to grow and process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of data. Our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our privacy, data security, and data protection obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy, \ndata security, and data protection practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims. \nInterruptions or performance problems, including failure to ensure accessibility, associated with our offerings and technology capabilities may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business and future growth prospects depend in part on the ability of our existing and potential customers and shoppers to access our offerings and technology capabilities at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. Instacart is built upon a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly extensive. Our software, including open-source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released, and we have in the past released, and may in the future release, new software that inadvertently causes interruptions in the availability or functionality of Instacart. Bugs or errors in our software, including open-source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems have in the past and could in the future result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to retailers, customers, brands, or shoppers, cause incorrect calculations relating to the prices or discounts available to consumers, cause incorrect calculations relating to the payments we make to or fees we receive from or charge to retailers, customers, brands, or shoppers, or create vulnerabilities in our systems which bad actors may exploit to perpetrate fraud or otherwise harm our business. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects or errors in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages, operational errors, and other performance problems due to a variety of other factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, defects in third-party software, human errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of customers accessing our offerings and technology capabilities simultaneously, website hosting disruptions, interruptions to business and operations due to malicious actors utilizing bots or other automated means to access Instacart, denial of service attacks, or other security-related incidents. In addition, retailers have experienced these issues, which have impacted the ability of customers and shoppers to place and fulfill orders with those retailers. These events have resulted and may continue to result in losses in revenue including through increased fraud activity and issuing appeasement credits and refunds as well as incentives for future orders to impacted customers and losses of customers or retailers due to perceived weaknesses in our systems and protective measures. In addition, the affected party could seek monetary recourse from us for their losses, and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems or adequate remedies within an acceptable period of time. Moreover, some of our offerings rely on the software and technology capabilities of third parties, our strategic partners, or our collaborators, all of which are subject to the interruption and performance problem risks described above and which have required and will require third-party collaboration to detect and remediate.\nIt may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times and as our offerings and technology capabilities become more complex and customer traffic increases. When our offerings and technology capabilities are unavailable or customers or shoppers are unable to access our offerings and technology capabilities within a reasonable amount of time or at all, we have experienced and may in the future experience a loss of retailers, customers, brands, or shoppers, lost or delayed market acceptance of Instacart and our offerings, delays in payment to us by retailers, injury to our reputation and brand, regulatory inquiries, legal claims against us, and the diversion of our resources. In addition, to the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. We also rely on systems, including third-party systems, to deliver incentives and communications to customers and shoppers. Failure to properly configure these systems has previously had a negative impact on our business and may adversely impact our business in the future.\nIf we are not able to continue to introduce new features or offerings successfully and to make enhancements to existing offerings, our ability to grow and operate our business could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract new retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers and increase revenue from existing retailers, customers, and brands depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing offerings and to introduce new features or offerings. To grow our business and be competitive, we must develop offerings, features, and functionality that reflect the constantly evolving nature of technology and the needs of retailers, consumers, brands, and shoppers. The success of these and any other enhancements or developments depend on several factors, including their timely \nintroduction and completion, sufficient demand, and cost effectiveness. It is difficult to accurately predict retailer, consumer, brand, or shopper adoption of new features or offerings, and related shifts in consumer shopping behavior, as well as our recent rapid growth and limited experience in operating our business at its current scale, scope, and complexity. Such uncertainty limits our ability to predict our future results of operations and subjects us to a number of challenges, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. If we cannot navigate such uncertainties or are unable to successfully develop new features or offerings or to enhance our existing offerings or otherwise overcome technological challenges and competing technologies to gain market acceptance, then our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur ability to develop new offerings, features, and functionality to meet industry demands is important to our value proposition to retailers, consumers, brands, and shoppers, and if we fail to continue to successfully innovate, we could lose existing retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers, which could impact our growth and results of operations. We are building and improving machine learning models and other technological capabilities to drive improved customer and shopper experience, as well as efficiencies in our operations, such as optimized payment processing, customer service, shopper acquisition and onboarding, automated key support workflows, and batching, picking, and routing algorithms to help shoppers work more efficiently and with greater accuracy in fulfilling orders. While we expect these technologies to lead to improvements in the performance of our offerings and operations, including inventory prediction and customer traffic prediction and management, any flaws or failures of such technologies could cause interruptions or delays in our service, which may harm our business. For example, failure to accurately collect retailer catalog information, which drives item pricing and availability, or reflect changes to those files in our systems could result in significant losses of revenue. We are increasing our investment in product development and hiring and retaining highly skilled engineering personnel to support these efforts, but such investments may not be effective in maintaining or improving the experience for retailers, customers, or shoppers or provide a positive return on investment. Moreover, we may make these investments and other business decisions that reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our goals to improve our offerings, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and research analysts covering us and may also not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, technological innovation in the online grocery industry from our competitors or other third parties, such as automation or next-generation fulfillment, could render our offerings less desirable or obsolete.\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning solutions, and our use of such solutions, could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have incorporated and may continue to incorporate additional artificial intelligence and machine learning (“AIML”) solutions into our platform, offerings, services, and features, including those based on large language models, and these applications have become more important to our operations and to our future growth over time. We expect to rely on AIML solutions to help drive future growth in our business and reduce costs, but there can be no assurance that we will realize the desired or anticipated benefits from AIML or at all. We may also fail to properly implement or market our AIML solutions. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AIML into their products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, our offerings based on AIML may expose us to additional lawsuits and regulatory investigations and subject us to legal liability as well as brand and reputational harm. For example, if the content, analyses, or recommendations that AIML applications assist in producing are or are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, or biased, or infringe on third-party intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. Third-party AIML technologies, including agent-based applications capable of performing online tasks on behalf of users, may change how consumers interact with our offerings, including our advertising offerings. Failure to adapt our offerings to such technologies may in the future impact our financial performance and results of operations. A number of national, state, and local regulators have adopted comprehensive legal compliance frameworks specifically for AIML, and others may adopt similar frameworks in the future. For example, both the European Union and Colorado have adopted such AIML regulations. These and any future regulations may impact our ability to utilize our AIML solutions or develop new solutions and any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. Our use of AIML applications may also create additional confidentiality, security, and related risks. For instance, any sensitive information (including confidential, competitive, proprietary, or personal data) that we input into a third-party AIML solution could be leaked or disclosed to others, including if sensitive information is used to train a third party’s AIML model. Additionally, the use of AIML applications has resulted in, and may in the future result in, cybersecurity incidents that implicate the personal data of end users of such applications. Any such cybersecurity incidents related to our \nuse of AIML applications could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. AIML also presents emerging ethical issues and if our use of AIML becomes controversial, we may experience brand or reputational harm.\nWe are making substantial investments to expand our offerings and technologies to capitalize on new and unproven business opportunities and expect to increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\nWe have made substantial investments to expand our offerings and technologies to capitalize on new and unproven business opportunities, including new fulfillment options and use cases, expansion into retail categories outside of grocery, the development of hardware products, and automated, AIML technologies. We intend to continue investing significant resources in developing these technologies, tools, initiatives, features, and offerings that we believe will enable our success in new markets or areas of business and/or strengthen our core business. For example, we have expanded our offerings to retailers in categories adjacent to the grocery industry, including alcohol, pharmacy, electronics, beauty, and home improvement. We also launched Connected Stores, a suite of in-store technologies, including artificial intelligence-powered shopping carts and customer checkout solutions, offered to our retail partners. If we do not spend our development budget efficiently or effectively on commercially successful and innovative technologies or ventures, or if we are unable to timely introduce and commercialize such offerings, we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. These initiatives also have a high degree of risk, as they involve nascent industries and unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or no prior development or operating experience. Because these initiatives are new, they may involve claims and liabilities, expenses, regulatory challenges, and other risks, some of which we cannot currently anticipate. Certain initiatives may also involve committed incremental investments or payments over long periods of time before they become accretive to our revenue or margin, and if they never become accretive, we may be contractually obligated to make payments or incur expenses in connection with initiatives for an extended period without sufficient, or any, economic or financial benefit. Further, our development efforts with respect to new offerings and technologies could distract management from current operations and divert capital and other resources from our more established offerings and technologies. For example, the design, development, manufacture, and global distribution of hardware products produced by Caper will require continued investment in operating expenses, headcount, and executive time and attention.\nProducing and offering hardware products will also involve new or heightened risks to our business, such as manufacturing and inventory risks resulting from supply chain disruptions, user safety risks and additional expenses resulting from product defects, import and export expenses, in particular, if such expenses increase as a result of tariffs or other trade restrictions enacted by the United States and responses by foreign governments to such policies, and other hardware-related costs. For example, any interruption to the manufacturing, inventory, or import and export of hardware products produced by Caper may negatively impact the development, deployment, and adoption of such products. Although we believe these investments will improve our financial results over the long term, they may negatively impact our short-term financial results, which may be inconsistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders. Moreover, there can be no assurance that retailer, consumer, or brand demand for such initiatives will exist or be sustained at the levels that we anticipate, or that any of these initiatives will gain sufficient traction or market acceptance to generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that offerings developed by others will render any new offerings noncompetitive or obsolete. Even if we are successful in expanding our offerings or technologies to enter new markets or areas of business, regulatory authorities may subject us to new rules or restrictions, including in their interpretations of existing retailer or brand collective bargaining agreements, in response to our innovations that could increase our expenses or prevent us from successfully deriving value from these offerings or technologies. For example, our Instacart Health offering may subject us to rules governing the use and processing of health information, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”), and regulatory requirements for interacting with health plans, government benefit programs, nonprofits, and other players in the healthcare space. If we do not realize the expected benefits of these investments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective, and failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase and engage our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our offerings.\nPromoting awareness and driving adoption of our offerings is important to our ability to grow our business, and attracting and engaging new retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers can be costly. Our consumer marketing efforts currently include, without limitation, digital performance marketing that includes search, programmatic, and social; \ncustomer relationship management (“CRM”) based marketing that includes push notifications, text messaging, email marketing, linear television, audio, and shopping ads; and co-marketing efforts with retailers, payment providers, brands, and other partners. Some of these marketing efforts rely on our ability to utilize third-party systems or platforms, which are subject to their own operational and regulatory risks. To drive existing customer reengagement, we also utilize targeted promotions including time-limited free delivery offers and coupons. We also provide incentives to brands to advertise on our platform, increase their engagement, and promote the launch of new advertising solutions. For shoppers, we reach them primarily through digital performance marketing and through in-app prompts. Our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive, and we may fail to generate a meaningful return on these initiatives, if at all. For example, we have incurred increased expenditures on our marketing and consumer incentive initiatives to accelerate the growth of our business, which have and may continue to have an effect on revenue and may harm our profitability in the near term. We also have limited experience conducting broad brand marketing campaigns and other marketing initiatives given the current scale, scope, and complexity of our business. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of consumer marketing efforts, it may not offset the additional marketing expenses we incur. Our marketing campaigns may also be long-term endeavors, and we may not be able to accurately assess the success of these campaigns for several periods. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective or if we reduce our marketing expenditures, we expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to engage or expand our base of retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers will be impaired and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer.\nMaintaining and enhancing our reputation as a differentiated and category-defining company is critical to attracting and expanding our relationships with retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers. The successful promotion of our brand and the market’s awareness of our offerings will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, ability to continue to develop our offerings, and ability to successfully differentiate our offerings from competitive offerings. We expect to invest substantial resources to promote and maintain our brand, but there is no guarantee that our brand development strategies will enhance the recognition of our brand or lead to increased sales. The strength of our brand will depend largely on our ability to provide quality services at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased GTV, orders, or revenue, and even if they do, the increases in GTV or orders may not persist and any increases in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in promoting and maintaining our brand and reputation. In order to protect our brand, we also expend substantial resources to register and defend our trademarks and to prevent others from using the same or substantially similar marks. Despite these efforts, we may not always be successful in protecting our trademarks, and we may suffer dilution, loss of reputation, or other harm to our brand. If our efforts to cost-effectively promote and maintain our brand are not successful, our results of operations and our ability to attract and engage customers, partners, and employees may be adversely affected. Further, even if our brand recognition and customer loyalty increase, this may not yield increased revenue for us.\nUnfavorable publicity regarding Instacart, shoppers, customer service, or privacy, data security, and data protection practices could also harm our reputation and diminish confidence in, and the use of, our services. Fear of loss of customers or lack of customer adoption due to poor service quality or negative customer or shopper reviews or press may make retailers reluctant to join or remain on Instacart. The same negative effects could occur as a result of trust and safety or fraud incidents. The loss of customers or retailers due to poor shopper performance or a trust and safety incident caused by a shopper, customer, or third party could harm our business. In addition, negative publicity related to strategic partners, marketing partners or key brands that we have partnered with may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is not directly related to us. If we fail to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand successfully or to maintain loyalty among retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers, or if we incur substantial expenses in unsuccessful attempts to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand, we may fail to attract or increase the engagement of retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer.\n If we fail to offer high-quality support, our ability to attract and engage customers and shoppers could suffer.\nCustomers and shoppers rely on our and our partners’ support personnel and technologies to resolve issues and realize the full benefits that Instacart provides. High-quality support to both customers and shoppers is also important for the expansion of Instacart’s use by our existing customers. The importance of our support function will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. We rely in part on support personnel and contractors in countries outside of the United States, and government actions in those countries such as curfews have in the past and could in the future slow down our systems and ability to timely respond to customer and shopper issues. We also rely in part on support technologies, including self-service and AIML solutions. Those technologies have in the past and may in the future fail to perform as expected or fail to adequately address support issues resulting in customer and shopper dissatisfaction. If we do \nnot help customers and shoppers quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to maintain and expand our revenue from existing and new customers could suffer, as well as our reputation with existing or potential customers.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting and engaging retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers. Future changes to our pricing model could adversely affect our business.\nDemand for our offerings is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including our strategies relating to the amount of potential earnings required to attract shoppers, incentives paid to shoppers, and the fees we charge retailers, customers, and brands. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements, constraints or changes, supply chain issues, the price sensitivity of consumers in different income groups or other demographics, inflation, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, have in the past significantly affected and may in the future significantly affect our pricing strategies. Competition, regulation, or other factors may cause us to change the pricing or implementation of our delivery or service fees for customers, increase the incentives we pay to shoppers that utilize Instacart, adjust the fees we charge retailers or brands, or increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and increase the engagement of retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers in response to competitive, regulatory, and other external pressures. For example, certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings, including subscription offerings for bundled services. We may need to spend significant amounts on marketing and both customer and shopper incentives to deploy innovative and novel pricing and incentive strategies to retain or attract new customers and shoppers. We have launched, and may in the future launch, new or updated pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription offerings like Instacart+, and customer or shopper loyalty programs, or modify existing pricing methodologies or pricing models and fulfillment options, due to a variety of reasons, including to address changes in the market for our offerings as competitors introduce new offerings and features or in response to actions taken by our retail partners, to regulatory or other legal challenges, or as we launch and scale new strategic initiatives or use cases. These new or updated pricing strategies and initiatives may not ultimately be successful in attracting and engaging retailers, customers, brands, or shoppers or may negatively impact growth rates, customer retention, and engagement as well as our financial results. We also offer brands and retailers tools and products, including through our Eversight business, to enable them to optimize online pricing and promotions strategies. If these solutions fail to generate improved results for brands and retailer sales, brands and retailers may choose to not use such solutions. If these solutions negatively impact consumer price perception, our brand reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers could be harmed. The increasing complexity of our pricing models and related expansion of our business may also require us to update our internal systems for invoicing retailers or brands or incur costs to remediate errors or disputes in existing invoices.\nFurther, consumers’ price sensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these locations. In particular, if we were to continue expanding internationally, we may be required to change our pricing strategies and to adjust to different cultural norms, including with respect to consumer pricing and gratuities. While we do and will attempt to set prices for our services based on our prior operating experience and customer, retailer, brand, and shopper feedback and engagement levels, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing, and we could be underpricing or overpricing our services. In particular, we have limited experience pricing our offerings in volatile macroeconomic environments and at the current scale, scope, and complexity of our business. As a result, our historical data and operating experience may be insufficient to adequately inform our future pricing strategies for changing market environments. In addition, if the services on Instacart change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. Changes to any components of our pricing model may, among other things, result in customer dissatisfaction, lead to a loss of customers on Instacart, and seriously harm our business.\nIf retailers, customers, brands, shoppers, or other third parties using Instacart engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity, it could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of retailers, customers, brands, shoppers, and other third parties, either during their use of Instacart or otherwise, and we may be unable to protect or provide a safe environment for constituents on Instacart as a result of criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous actions by any such parties. Such actions have historically resulted, and may in the future result, in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for retailers, customers, brands, shoppers, and other third parties, as applicable, or business interruption, brand and reputational damage, or significant liabilities for us. Certain events, including incidents of criminal behavior, episodes of civil unrest, or the imposition of curfews, may impact retailers, which in turn may impact the ability of shoppers to provide services to \ncustomers through Instacart. With respect to shoppers, although we administer certain qualification processes for shoppers on Instacart, including one or more general identification, criminal background, department of motor vehicle, and/or motor vehicle record checks on shoppers through third-party service providers prior to engagement, these qualification processes and background checks may not expose all potentially relevant information and are limited in certain jurisdictions according to national and local laws and availability of records. Moreover, our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility. We have in the past received, and we expect to continue to receive, complaints from retailers, customers, shoppers, and other third parties, as well as actual or threatened legal action against us related to shopper, customer, retailer, and other third party conduct.\nIf shoppers or individuals impersonating shoppers or customers engage in criminal activity, fraud, including identity theft, use of stolen or fraudulent credit card data, misconduct, breach our terms of service, or inappropriate conduct or use Instacart as a conduit for criminal activity, or we fail to identify or detect, or experience delays in identifying or detecting such activity or events, our offerings may not be viewed as safe, reliable, or appealing, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result. Such negative public perception of our offerings or brand would adversely impact our brand, reputation, and business. We have in the past experienced, and may experience in the future, inappropriate conduct and criminal activity by certain shoppers or other bad actors, including fraudulent uses of credit cards, manipulation or falsification of data related to shopper activity, social engineering attacks to gain access to customer and shopper accounts, as well as fraudulent use of our payment card programs. This conduct has in the past involved, and may in the future involve, coordinated and complex fraud schemes that are difficult to detect and prevent. Given their complexity, such schemes have in the past persisted, and future schemes may also persist, for lengthy periods prior to detection. As a result of these fraudulent schemes, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, liable for orders facilitated on Instacart with fraudulent credit card transactions, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. In addition, even if we are not contractually required to do so, we have historically provided retailers with business concessions for related losses in certain cases and may provide additional concessions as a result of future schemes. These retailer concessions and any liability we otherwise face from such inappropriate or fraudulent conduct negatively impact our revenue and financial results. In addition, the process for quantifying the amount of financial losses from these fraudulent schemes may be lengthy, in part due to their complexity and, in cases where the fraudulent activity occurs through systems controlled by our partners, we may be unable to remediate or prevent this activity in a timely manner or at all due to limitations in, or our ability to, interact with such systems. As a result, the impact of such schemes on our financial results may continue into future periods or have higher impacts to our financial results than we anticipate, even following their termination. Our failure to adequately detect, address, or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or regulatory action, result in errors in our financial statements that could result in corrections to or restatements of our historical financial statements, cause delays in the preparation and filing of our periodic reports as well as failures to meet our reporting and other obligations as a public company, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If other criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of retailers, customers, brands, shoppers, or other third parties, our ability to attract retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers may be harmed, and our reputation, business, and financial results could be adversely affected.\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to Instacart, whether generated by us or third parties, such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nFurther, we are regularly subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by shoppers, customers, or third parties while using Instacart, or even when shoppers, customers, or third parties are not actively using Instacart. On a smaller scale, we regularly face litigation related to claims by shoppers for the actions of customers or third parties. We carry insurance for such incidents, including automobile liability and general liability insurance, although such policies do not cover all claims to which we are exposed and are not always adequate to indemnify us for all liability. Although shoppers are required to carry their own insurance policies, including automobile insurance, they may fail to acquire adequate coverage or any coverage at all. As a result, we may be subject to liability for incidents involving shoppers that our insurance policies may not cover or the cost of our policies may increase. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them and may suffer reputational harm regardless of legal outcomes. As we expand our products and offerings, this insurance risk will grow. \nThe impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, public health incidents, weather events, and natural catastrophes, including the resulting effect on consumer spending, may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may vary based on the impact of disruptive events or changes in our industry or the economy on us and retailers, consumers, brands, and shoppers.\nFor example, our business is impacted by the amount of disposable income that consumers have to spend on online grocery shopping. Actual or perceived risks of an economic recession, elevated interest rates, cessation of or changes to government aid programs, and recent inflationary pressures have adversely impacted consumer disposable income and resulted in decreased customer retention and engagement as well as reduced advertising spending by brands. We may continue to experience these impacts, including as a result of tariffs or other trade restrictions enacted by the United States and responses by foreign governments to such policies. In addition, in response to adverse economic conditions or a decrease in discretionary income, consumers may opt to purchase groceries or other consumer goods themselves, instead of through Instacart, or choose to purchase groceries from bargain or other lower-cost retailers that are not on Instacart. We may not be able to fully offset higher costs through operational efficiencies and/or price optimizations, and while certain of our new offerings are focused on value and affordability, these initiatives may not fully offset pricing challenges faced by customers. In addition, increases in food, labor, fuel, rent, energy, supply, and other costs, many of which are beyond the control of our retail partners, have increased retailers’ operating costs and caused our retail partners to raise prices and may cause further price increases in the future. In many cases, these retailers may not be able to pass along these increased costs to consumers and, as a result, may reduce product offerings or cease operations. If spending at many of the retailers in our network declines, or if a significant number of these retailers goes out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our service, which could harm our business and results of operations. Reduced customer spending on Instacart could also cause our retail partners to reduce or cease engagement with Instacart. Further, increases in gas prices or other factors that increase the costs to operate motor vehicles could make it prohibitively expensive for shoppers to deliver to customers.\nIn addition, negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad resulting from disruptive events, including future public health threats, the military conflict involving Russia and Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and economic sanctions imposed on Russia and Belarus, bank failures, changes in international trade relations, political turmoil, weather events, and natural catastrophes, including warfare and terrorist attacks on the United States or elsewhere, could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition as well as demand for our offerings and the growth of our business. In particular, we generate a significant proportion of our GTV from a limited number of geographical markets. If such negative conditions disproportionally affect these markets, the demand for our offerings and the growth of our business may be more severely impacted. In addition, future public health outbreaks could cause operational disruptions and incur additional expenses including expenses associated with health and safety protocols and processes, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, due to the size, scope, and nature of our operations, the expenses we may need to incur to protect the health and safety of shoppers and certain of our employees in the event of future public health outbreaks may be higher than similar expenses that companies in other industries may need to incur. In addition, these events and any impact of these events on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business and the business of our partners, including supply chain disruptions, as well as the ability of shoppers using Instacart to complete deliveries. Such disruptions may create additional costs for us to maintain or resume operations and may also negatively affect the growth of our business.\nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially in recent years, and we expect to continue expanding the scale of our operations. If we are unable to effectively manage that growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.\nIn recent years, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and Canada. This expansion increased the complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our results of operations.\nWhile the pace of our headcount expansion has slowed, we may grow our number of employees in order to meet our business plans or comply with regulatory changes. Our organizational structure will continue to evolve as we add additional retailers, customers, brands, shoppers, employees, offerings, and technologies, improve upon our product infrastructure, and as we continue to expand further domestically and internationally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to retain or hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff, including engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our \nnew hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in retaining, hiring, training, managing, and integrating these new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining or increasing the productivity of our existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Additionally, certain units of employees may decide to unionize, in which case, we would be legally compelled to enter into good faith negotiations with the union representative over a collective bargaining agreement. Such negotiations or collective bargaining agreements may negatively impact our financial performance or results of operations. Furthermore, any workforce restructuring, may result in increased attrition beyond our intended reduction, reduce employee morale, and may negatively impact employee recruiting and retention as well as our operations, our ability to grow our business, and our financial results. Properly managing our growth will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could likewise harm our business. If we are unable to expand our operations, appropriately manage our headcount and retain and increase the productivity of our existing employees, or attract sufficient shoppers in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service customers, customer satisfaction will be adversely affected, and this may cause customers to switch to our competitors’ platforms, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow response times, or poor experiences for customers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve the technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our transaction processing and reporting, operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. We may require additional capital and management resources to grow and mature in these areas. Such investments may also require diversion of financial resources from other projects, such as the development of Instacart and related offerings. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe depend on highly skilled personnel to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain, and motivate our personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur success and future growth depend largely upon the continued services of our management team. From time to time, there have been and may continue to be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of these personnel, due to voluntary termination of employment, illness, death, disability, or otherwise. Our executive officers are employed on an at-will basis, which means they may terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, including due to a leave of absence for medical reasons or otherwise, or the failure by our executive team to effectively work together or with our employees and lead our company, could harm our business. We also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers because of the complexity of our offering capabilities. We do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any member of management or other employee.\nIn addition, our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to identify and hire skilled personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require, including engineering, software design and programming, marketing, sales, and other key personnel, and our business plans and growth may depend on hiring a significant number of additional employees. Such efforts will require significant time, expense, and attention as there is intense competition for such individuals, and new hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales segments and territories. In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on developing, motivating, and retaining our best employees, most of whom are at-will employees. If we fail to identify, recruit, and integrate strategic personnel hires, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, the failure to continue hiring new, or the loss of any significant number of our existing engineering personnel could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These risks pertaining to the recruitment, retention, development, motivation, and productivity of our employees may persist or be heightened as a result of any workforce restructuring, and as our workforce becomes increasingly distributed as a result of our Flex First workforce model. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached various legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines or experiences significant volatility (including as valuations of companies comparable to us decline due to overall market trends, inflation, and related market effects or otherwise), or increases such that prospective employees believe there is limited upside to the value of our equity awards, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees or result in us granting additional equity \nawards, which would result in additional stock-based compensation expense and further dilution to our stockholders. If we are not able to effectively add and retain employees, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely impacted, and our business and future growth prospects will be harmed.\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nWe believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date and that the critical nature of the offerings that we provide promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth, and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we grow and develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture. In addition, we may find it difficult to maintain our company culture if our employees elect to work remotely as permitted by our Flex First workforce model. Remote work, as well as any workforce restructuring may negatively impact employee morale and productivity and may also harm collaboration and innovation. If we fail to maintain our company culture, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nWe are exposed to collection and credit risks, which could impact our results of operations.\nOur accounts receivable are subject to collection and credit risks, which could negatively impact our results of operations and affect our liquidity and our ability to fully fund our ongoing operations. Retailers are generally obligated to pay our fees within 45 days of invoicing, and brands are generally obligated to do so within 30 to 90 days. In times of economic recession or uncertainty or as a result of any disruptive event such as uncertainty in the political and regulatory environment and financial markets or future public health outbreaks, the number of retailers or brands that default on payments owed to us may increase. In addition, our results of operations may be impacted by significant bankruptcies among retailers or brands, which could negatively impact our revenue and cash flows. We cannot assure you that our processes to monitor and mitigate these risks will be effective. If we fail to adequately assess and monitor our collection and credit risks, we could experience longer payment cycles, increased collection costs, and higher bad debt expense, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth in our public disclosures may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at a similar rate, if at all.\nThe estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth included in our public disclosures may prove to be inaccurate. Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate, including as a result of any of the risks described herein in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at a similar rate, if at all.\nThe variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of addressable retailers, consumers, or brands covered by our market opportunity estimates will purchase our offerings at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with our offerings and those of our competitors. Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth included in our public disclosures should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, collaborations, commercial arrangements, or alliances could be difficult to identify, pose integration challenges, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our services and grow our business in response to changing technologies, consumer demands, and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may choose to expand our services and grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. We have also entered in the past, and will continue to seek in the future, strategic partnerships, collaborations, or commercial arrangements, or alliances with third parties, which we refer to collectively as collaborations. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates or collaborators can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or collaborations, including as a result of regulatory inquiries or actions by antitrust authorities. In particular, our proposed or completed acquisitions or collaborations may be subject to investigations or enforcement actions by antitrust regulatory bodies in the countries in which we operate, such as \nthe Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), which have recently increased their scrutiny of merger or collaboration activity, particularly in the technology sector. In addition, once we have completed an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business.\nCertain of our collaborations also are, and may in the future be, with third parties that are well-capitalized and have significant size, scale, geographic, and other advantages. As a result, certain of the terms in such arrangements may be less favorable to us. We will also have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to our arrangements. These arrangements may not lead to the business, growth, and financial outcomes that we expect, may raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, and may also result in significantly higher costs for us or other negative impacts or impediments to our business, operations, regulatory posture, or strategy, which we may not anticipate or currently project, that result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, these collaborations may span multiple years, include significant fees, and often require significant upfront costs. As a result, we may not be able to accurately assess the success of these collaborations for several periods and only after we have made substantial investments and expenditures. If any collaboration results in future material adverse effects to our business, financial condition, and results of operations, we may not be able to terminate such collaboration on a timely or cost-effective basis. In addition, we offer features or use cases to our customers, such as restaurants, through certain collaborations. If any such collaborations are terminated or any of our collaborators refuse to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find other partners to continue offering such features or use cases, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. Similarly, our ability to continue providing certain features or use cases could be negatively impacted if any such collaborators experience a disruption in their operations, the quality of their services decline or are otherwise unable to offer their services as customers expect. Certain of these third parties, such as retailers and brands, also engage with our business in other aspects, and any disagreements or disputes in connection with collaborations may result in the loss of these third parties as customers or partners in other areas of our business. We have issued in the past, and may in the future issue, new equity or equity-linked securities to partners, which dilute our existing stockholders and may include affirmative or restrictive covenants as well as redemption or repurchase provisions.\nThe risks we face in connection with acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or collaborations include: \n•negative impacts to our financial results as a result of incurring charges or fees or assuming substantial debt or other liabilities, adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, exposure to claims and disputes by stockholders and third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, failing to generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition, partnership, or collaboration, or even significant negative impacts to our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\n•regulatory inquiries or actions, including changes to applicable regulatory frameworks and/or remedies imposed by antitrust authorities such as divestitures, ownership or operational restrictions, or other structural or behavioral remedies, either as a condition to or following the completion of a transaction;\n•difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, offerings, technologies, personnel, or operations of any company that we acquire or with which we collaborate, particularly if key personnel of an acquired company decide not to work for us, which may result in delays in integration or realization of anticipated synergies or other benefits and/or impede our ability to incorporate their results or contributions in our reported metrics;\n•disruptions to our ongoing business, diversion of resources, increases to our expenses, and distraction of our management;\n•potential delays or reductions of customer purchases for both us and the company we acquire or with which we collaborate due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company or negative reputational impacts;\n•potential for strategic partners or collaborators to establish or strengthen relationships with current or future retailers and customers, or other parties with whom we have relationships, which could limit our ability to promote our offerings to those parties and reduce our number of customers;\n•difficulties in, or inability to, successfully sell any acquired products;\n•our use of cash to pay for an acquisition limiting other potential uses of our cash;\n•if we incur debt to fund an acquisition, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, as well as financial maintenance covenants; and\n•if we issue a significant amount of equity or equity-linked securities in connection with future acquisitions, strategic partnerships, or collaborations, existing stockholders will be diluted and earnings per share may decrease, and we may face unfavorable tax treatment with respect to such securities.\nThe occurrence of any of these foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and expose us to unknown risks or liabilities.\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including customer, retailer, brand, and shopper counts and key business metrics such as orders and GTV, with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics or how we define such metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics as of or for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in these measurements. We have also refined and may further refine in the future our methodology for tracking certain operational metrics from time to time, to the extent practicable, including to improve overall accuracy, as a result of business updates, and to align with management’s view of business and operating performance. Any of these updates may result in changes in certain business and operating trends and may impact comparability of these metrics across periods. Further, the accuracy of our operating metrics could be impacted by fraudulent users of Instacart. As a result, our expectations of future trends may not be accurate or may be overstated. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe have funded our operations since our founding primarily through equity financings and cash generated from our operations. We cannot be certain if our operations will continue generating sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend to continue to make investments to support the development of our offerings and will require additional funds for such development. We may need additional funding for marketing expenses and to develop and expand sales resources, develop new features, or enhance our offerings, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. We have also expended and may continue to expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance obligations that arise upon the vesting and/or settlement of certain of our RSUs. Accordingly, we might need or may want to engage in future equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, macroeconomic factors, including elevated interest rates, and bank failures have caused disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide, which may reduce our ability to access capital and negatively affect our liquidity in the future. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, our ability to develop our offerings, support our business growth, and respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets, and any debt financing we secure may have higher interest rates and could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our common stock and diluting their interests.\nRisks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf the contractor status of shoppers who use Instacart is successfully challenged, or if additional requirements are placed on our engagement of independent contractors, we may face adverse business, financial, tax, legal, and other consequences.\nWe are involved in multiple individual and class-action lawsuits and government actions that claim that shoppers should be classified as employees rather than as independent contractors. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings-Independent Contractor Classification Matters” for more information. We have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant costs and legal fees in defending the status of shoppers as independent contractors. In particular, we have been and may continue to be subject to administrative audits with various state and local enforcement agencies, including audits related to shopper classification, state statute and local ordinance requirements, and unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation contributions. Although we believe that we comply with applicable legal requirements and that shoppers are properly classified as independent contractors, we may be required to make significant payments, including through settlements, penalties, and interest as a result of these audits. A judgment, settlement, or order issued by a court or governmental body or otherwise in connection with any judicial, administrative, or legal proceeding that results in us being prohibited from continuing to use independent-contractor shoppers in the manner we currently do, may, among other things:\n•require us to adopt novel or different delivery fulfillment strategies or introduce new shopper tasks that result in increased risk of litigation against our existing business model, or may increase risk of adverse determinations in our ongoing actions and proceedings;\n•significantly increase our costs to serve customers due to potential changes in our business model and fulfillment strategies that would be required;\n•impair or prevent the fulfillment of customer orders, cause disruption of service to customers, or cause a reduction in fulfillment options for customers;\n•impair our ability to innovate upon and expand our offerings, pursue new business verticals, or innovate on our operational strategies;\n•create challenges in recruiting and retaining adequate shopper supply due to potential necessary changes including restricting the flexibility of shoppers by instituting minimum, maximum, or set hours of work, or designated locations for work, or controlling costs in other ways (such as limiting shopper access to Instacart or shopper incentives or eliminating tips), which could result in disruption to service and harm our business;\n•incur significant expenses, which may be due to costs associated with existing employment-related laws, such as wage and hour laws, including minimum wage and overtime, liability for and withholding of employment taxes, and employee benefits, including medical insurance, workers compensation coverage, among others, as well as other related liabilities;\n•lead us to increase customer fees or charges as a result of the increased costs resulting from shoppers being classified as employees or alternative fulfillment strategies we may implement, which may lead to customer dissatisfaction with such increased fees, which could result in significant decreases in orders, GTV, and revenue;\n•expose us to significant retroactive liability, such as liability for meal breaks, overtime premiums, and statutory penalties;\n•lead us to take additional actions that we determine are in the best interests of our business, customers, partners, and growth strategy, including potential cessation of operations in certain service areas;\n•lead to significant operational disruptions and challenges that we do not have experience managing; and\n•result in losses in excess of the accrued amounts in our reserve balances.\nThe impact of one or more of the foregoing would cause our results of operations to vary significantly and would materially impair our growth prospects, business, financial condition, and results of our operations and specifically impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue and cost of revenue.\nFurther, the state of the law regarding independent contractor status varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and among governmental agencies and is subject to change based on court decisions and regulation. For example, on April 30, 2018, in its decision in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. L.A. Superior Court (“Dynamex”), the California Supreme Court adopted \na new standard, referred to as the “ABC” test, for determining whether a company “employs” or is the “employer” for purposes of the California Wage Orders. The Dynamex decision altered the analysis of whether an individual has been properly classified as an independent contractor in California, making it more difficult to properly classify a worker as such. The California legislature subsequently codified the “ABC” test in the Dynamex decision as the default standard for independent contractor misclassification. On December 16, 2020, the California state ballot initiative, Proposition 22, which provides a framework that offers legal certainty regarding the status of independent workers offering delivery services and protects worker flexibility, the quality of on-demand work, and access to benefits for those who qualify, among other things, became effective. Although the constitutionality of Proposition 22 was subsequently challenged, on July 25, 2024, the California Supreme Court upheld Proposition 22 as constitutional. As a result, we expect Proposition 22 to provide more legal certainty over the status of independent workers offering delivery services in California. However, there may continue to be legal challenges, or legislative or other attempts to amend or otherwise invalidate the benefits, protections or the independent worker status provided by Proposition 22. Additionally, even though Proposition 22 was determined to be enforceable, we may still face allegations that certain of our business practices do not satisfy all the elements of Proposition 22. Further, Proposition 22 entitles shoppers in California to certain new pay standards and benefits, and imposes certain requirements, which increases costs for us in California, where a large number of shoppers who use Instacart are located. While we believe we properly provide all requisite pay standards and benefits under Proposition 22, we may nonetheless face various claims involving disputes over such pay standards and benefits.\nWe expect continuing challenges to the independent contractor classification of shoppers who use Instacart, or the imposition of additional requirements on the use of contractors. If legislation, regulations, or judicial decisions regarding contractors change adversely, including any changes similar to the Dynamex decision or California legislation, it would increase the already existing risk that shoppers who use Instacart could be construed as employees or increase costs through additional requirements imposed on the use of contractors, and would therefore significantly negatively impact our ability to contract with independent contractors for order fulfillment in those jurisdictions and result in one or more of the impacts described in the first paragraph of this risk factor, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we are or may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings. We are subject to investigations and legal proceedings relating to various matters including whether we fulfilled our contractual obligations to or improperly withheld pay or tips from shoppers, whether we adequately protected the public’s or shoppers’ health and safety, whether we properly provide protected leave, whether we properly paid sales tax, whether we properly implemented our service fees, whether we improperly conduct background checks of shoppers, and whether we are responsible for injury resulting from alleged shopper actions or negligence. We are also subject to investigations and legal proceedings involving bodily injury and property damage, labor and employment, anti-discrimination claims, commercial and contract disputes, unfair competition, consumer protection regulations, including fees and pricing and related disclosures and automatic renewal laws, intellectual property, transactions involving our securities, privacy, data security, and data protection, environmental laws and regulations, health and safety, weights and measures, compliance with regulatory requirements, and other matters. For example, we are currently subject to a securities class action lawsuit in federal court alleging federal securities law violations in connection with our IPO. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nThe results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. The frequency of such claims could increase in proportion to the number of retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers that use Instacart. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be costly and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we enter into a settlement arrangement, which we have done in the past, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business or remove valuable features or content from our platform, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMoreover, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for any claims or liabilities against us, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition \nof large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our mobile apps or website, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, false advertising, consumer protection, defamation, libel, and negligence, among others.\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with customers and shoppers. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we may voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules, new or upcoming rules or changes in the interpretation of such rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be to exempt certain categories of protection. For example, some plaintiffs’ attorneys have argued that certain shoppers are workers “in interstate commerce” and are thus exempt from the Federal Arbitration Act, and it remains possible that a court could find our agreements unenforceable against those shoppers. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to various laws and regulations, which may change or increase over time and subject us to increased compliance costs and liabilities.\nOur business is subject to changing laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, federal, state, and local laws, and in the future, country specific laws, governing the internet, e-commerce, and hardware devices, including electronic payments, privacy, data security, data protection, the use of AIML technologies, pay and fee transparency, health information privacy and security, consumer protection, marketing and advertising, gift cards, health and safety, food and product safety, product labeling and traceability, import and export, zoning and permitting, hardware device certification, sustainability, environmental, tax, insurance, employment, weights and measures, alcohol and other age-restricted products, and worker classification compensation, and transparency. Some of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and mobile and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. New laws and regulations have been and may continue to be adopted, implemented, or interpreted to apply to us, and existing laws and regulations that we currently comply with and operate under may be interpreted differently in the future, including as a result of changes to our business. Some of these laws and regulations will, or may in the future, require us to change our business and operations or pricing, which may be costly and harm our customer retention and engagement as well as our results of operations. Recent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general, and in particular, companies in the “gig economy” that rely on the services of independent contractors.\nRegulatory agencies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. Additionally, in response to public health threats, governments and regulatory agencies passed and may in the future pass new laws, ordinances, and regulations, often with little notice or opportunity for public comment, that impact our business. Such changes and other legal and regulatory uncertainties may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, in particular if such changes and uncertainties occur in markets where we generate relatively larger portions of our GTV.\nThe cost of compliance with the evolving and ever-changing legal and regulatory environment may be significant and have required us to modify our business and operations or pricing. Our failure to comply with existing or future laws, rules, and regulations could subject us to litigation, audits, investigations, disputes, or other legal proceedings that could result in fines, civil liability, mandatory injunctions that change how we operate, or cessation of operations. As our business matures and we expand geographically and into different retail categories or use cases, we may become subject to new laws and \nregulations in new jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how existing and future laws will be applied to our business as it exists today and may exist in the future.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business and the content on Instacart.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims or appeasement credits or refunds, and harm to our reputation and business relating to the nature of on-demand delivery of food and other consumer goods, including potential claims related to food offerings, delivery, and quality. For example, third parties have asserted, and in the future could assert, legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or accidents caused by our retail partners or shoppers while making a delivery to customers, defective products, or the sale, advertising, marketing, or consumption of alcoholic beverages, tobacco, or other regulated products by our retail partners to underage customers. Our new or planned future offering enhancements may also subject us to new or unforeseen risks relating to on-demand food and consumer goods delivery. For example, we have added health attribute information, such as identifying products on Instacart as gluten- or dairy-free, and need to rely on third parties for the accuracy of such information. Erroneous reporting or omission, whether or not in our control, may result in claims against us alleging personal injuries, false advertising, and related legal claims, as well as harm to our brand and reputation.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as caused by E. Coli, Norovirus, Hepatitis A, Campylobacter, Listeria, or Salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have severely injured the reputations of participants in the food business and could do so in the future as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the retailers or shoppers on Instacart, it could reduce customer confidence in and use of our offerings. The potential for acts of terrorism on food supply also exists, and if such an event occurs, it could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have in the past and may in the future also be subject to direct or indirect claims as a result of our relationships with, and services provided to, retailers, such as claims involving retailers’ pricing on Instacart, infringement of intellectual property, California Proposition 65, product liability, and the Americans with Disabilities Act, among others.\nWe are subject to rapidly changing and increasingly stringent laws, regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations relating to privacy, data security, and data protection. The obligations, restrictions, and costs imposed by these laws, or our actual or perceived failure to comply with them, could subject us to adverse business consequences and other liabilities that adversely affect our business, operations, and financial performance.\nAs part of our normal business activities, we collect, use, store, share, transmit, and otherwise process sensitive, proprietary, and confidential information, including personal information of retailers, customers, brands, shoppers, employees, and others. These activities are regulated by a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign privacy, data security, and data protection laws, regulations, and industry standards, which have become increasingly stringent in recent years. In addition, existing laws and regulations are complex and constantly evolving, and new laws and regulations that apply to our business are being introduced at every level of government in the United States, as well as internationally which could further restrict certain uses of the personal information of retailers, customers, brands, shoppers, employees, and others. We are, and may increasingly become, subject to various laws, regulations, and standards, and are subject to certain contractual obligations, industry standards, codes of conduct, and regulatory guidance relating to privacy, data security, and data protection in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful.\nIn the United States, there are numerous federal and state privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations governing the collection, use, storage, sharing, transmission, and other processing of personal information, including federal and state privacy laws, data security laws, data breach notification laws, consumer protection laws, and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For example, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (\"CAN-SPAM”) and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”) impose specific requirements on communications with customers.\nIn addition, many state legislatures have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights has and may continue to impact our business and ability to provide our products and \nservices. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the CCPA applies to personal data of consumers, business representatives, and employees who are California residents, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of such individuals to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for fines and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. The CCPA and other comprehensive U.S. state privacy laws have and may continue to further complicate compliance efforts, and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties with whom we work. For example, our marketing initiatives and Instacart Ads offerings could be further adversely affected, and additional investment in compliance may be required. Similar laws are being considered in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, and we expect additional investment in compliance to be required. The enactment of such laws could have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging and expose us to additional liability.\nWe are also subject to certain health information privacy and security laws. A number of state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses may use consumers’ health data. For example, the Washington My Health My Data Act creates restrictions on the use of consumer health data for purposes such as marketing and advertising. As a result, our marketing initiatives and Instacart Ads and Instacart Health offerings could be further limited and we have incurred and expect to continue incurring additional compliance expenses. We are also subject to additional health information privacy and security laws as a result of the limited amount of health information that we receive in connection with the prescription delivery services that we provide on behalf of pharmacy retailers. These laws and regulations include HIPAA, which establishes privacy, security, and breach notification standards for protected health information processed by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers, collectively referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services, as well as their covered subcontractors. We are regulated as a “business associate” of certain covered entity pharmacy retailers and must comply with HIPAA as applicable to business associates. We maintain a HIPAA compliance program, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misuse by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent noncompliance may not be effective in preventing all misuse, breaches, or violations. Violations of HIPAA may result in significant administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. State attorneys general also have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action that would allow individuals to sue in civil court for a HIPAA violation, its standards have been used as the basis for the duty of care in state civil suits, such as those for negligence or recklessness in misusing personal information. Many states in which we operate and in which our customers reside also have laws that protect the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with such state laws may also subject us to significant penalties. As we expand our Instacart Health offering, we anticipate that the risk associated with HIPAA compliance will increase and that we may be required to make significant investments in order to build compliant product offerings in the health space. Some U.S. states and the FTC have also adopted privacy laws or issued guidance limiting the collection and use of certain health information that may extend to our customers’ interactions with certain over-the-counter health products.\nFederal, state, and local privacy and consumer protection laws also govern specific technologies that we employ. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”), imposes significant restrictions on sending text messages or making telephone calls to mobile telephone numbers without the prior consent of the person being contacted. We also use identity verification technologies that may subject us to state and local biometric privacy laws. For example, the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”), regulates the collection, use, safeguarding, and storage of biometric information. The TCPA and BIPA provide for substantial penalties and statutory damages and have generated significant class action activity. The cost of litigating and settling claims that we have violated the TCPA, BIPA, or similar laws could be significant.\nForeign privacy laws are also undergoing a period of rapid change, have become more stringent in recent years, and may increase the costs and complexity of offering our offerings in new geographies. In Canada, where we operate, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), and various provincial laws require that companies give detailed privacy notices to consumers, obtain consent to use personal information, with limited exceptions, allow individuals to access and correct their personal information, and report certain data breaches. In addition, Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (“CASL”), prohibits email marketing without the recipient’s consent, with limited exceptions. Failure to comply with PIPEDA, CASL, or provincial privacy or data protection laws could result in significant fines and penalties or possible damage awards. The Canadian province of Quebec also passed a comprehensive privacy law that grants individuals extensive rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to consent to certain marketing and advertising practices. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries have immaterial operations in China, Australia, \nand Mexico and are subject to, respectively, China’s Personal Information Protection Law, Australia’s Privacy Act 1988 and Spam Act 2003, and Mexico’s Federal Law for the Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties. These laws impose a number of requirements on our processing of personal information and direct marketing activities that may increase our compliance costs and risk of facing regulatory enforcement action.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”) and to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Future expansion of our business, operations, or service offerings to the European Economic Area (“EEA”), will increase our exposure to data protection laws in the region, including the GDPR. The GDPR and UK GDPR impose strict requirements for processing personal data of individuals, give individuals extensive rights with respect to their personal data, and carry penalties for violations of up to the greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover in the European Union, and up to the greater of GBP 17.5 million or 4% total global annual turnover in the United Kingdom. Companies that violate the GDPR or UK GDPR may also face prohibitions on data processing and other corrective action, as well as private litigation brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests.\nEurope, the United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal data to other countries. In particular, the EEA and the United Kingdom have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the United States and other countries whose privacy laws they believe are inadequate. Other jurisdictions have in the past and may continue to adopt similarly stringent data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and United Kingdom to the United States in compliance with law, such as the EEA’s and UK’s standard contractual clauses, certain of these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions to the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, injunctions against our processing or transferring personal data necessary to operate our business, the inability to transfer data and work with partners, vendors and other third parties, and our ability to expand our business to the EEA, United Kingdom, or other countries with similar cross-border data transfer restrictions may be limited. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data out of the EEA and United Kingdom to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activist groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations.\nWe also publish privacy policies and other statements regarding data privacy, artificial intelligence, and security. Regulators in the United States have scrutinized and are increasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if these policies or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences.\nOther data protection laws in the EEA and the United Kingdom, such as those implementing the ePrivacy Directive, restrict the use of cookies and similar technologies on which our website, mobile app, and Instacart Ads offerings rely, including to facilitate online behavioral advertising. Regulators are increasingly focused on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and current national laws implementing the ePrivacy Directive are likely to be replaced in the European Union by a regulation known as the ePrivacy Regulation, which will significantly increase fines for non-compliance to GDPR-level fines. Other countries outside of Europe increasingly emulate European data protection laws. As a result, operating our business or offering our services in Europe or other countries with similar data protection laws would subject us to substantial compliance costs and potential liability and may require changes to the ways we collect and use personal information. Governments and regulators in certain jurisdictions, including Europe, are increasingly seeking to regulate the use, transfer, and other processing of non-personal information (for example, under the European Union’s Data Act). This means that, if and to the extent such regulations are relevant to our operations or those of our customers, certain of the risks and considerations outlined above may apply equally to our processing of both personal and non-personal data.\nIn addition, major technology platforms on which we rely, privacy advocates, and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, platform requirements or self-regulatory standards by which we are legally or contractually bound. If we fail to comply with these contractual obligations or standards, we may lose access to technology platforms on which we rely and face substantial regulatory enforcement, liability, and fines. For example, Apple requires \nmobile applications using its operating system, iOS, to affirmatively obtain an end user’s permission for cross-contextual advertising. Other technology platforms are considering similar restrictions. Such restrictions could limit the efficacy of our marketing activities and our Instacart Ads offerings. In addition to existing privacy-related laws, platform requirements, and binding self-regulatory standards, certain legislative proposals and draft regulations seek to further regulate targeted advertising activities, and regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the use of online tracking tools and compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral advertising ecosystem. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative solutions to support our marketing initiatives and/or change the way we deliver our Instacart Ads offerings. In addition, consumer resistance to the collection and sharing of the data used to deliver targeted advertising, increased visibility of consent or requirements to respond to “do not track” mechanisms (such as browser signals from the Global Privacy Control) as a result of regulatory or legal developments, the adoption by consumers of browser settings or “ad-blocking” software, and the development and deployment of new technologies could materially impact our ability to collect and use data or reduce our ability to deliver relevant promotions or media, which could materially impair the results of our operations.\nFurther, our business relies significantly on our ability to accept credit or debit card payments, including payments made using our co-branded credit card. Such payments are subject to the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”), Data Security Standard. We rely on vendors to handle PCI matters and to ensure PCI compliance. Despite our compliance efforts, we may become subject to claims that we have violated the PCI Data Security Standard, based on past, present, and future business practices. In addition, payment card networks may adopt changes to the PCI Data Security Standard, or change their interpretations of such rules in a way that we or our processors might find it difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. If we violate the PCI Data Security Standard or other applicable rules, we may incur fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards or suffer reputational harm, all of which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nDespite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance with the rapidly evolving privacy, data security, and data protection requirements discussed above. Any actual or perceived non-compliance, by us or the third parties upon whom we rely, could result in litigation and proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, or others (including class action claims or mass arbitration demands), expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry, fines and civil or criminal penalties, limited ability or inability to operate our business, offer services, or market our offerings in certain jurisdictions, negative publicity and harm to our brand and reputation, reduced overall demand for our offerings, or substantial changes to our business model or operations. Such occurrences could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the internet and mobile device accessibility of users. Companies and governmental agencies may restrict access to Instacart, our mobile apps, website, app stores, or the internet generally, which could negatively impact our operations.\nOur business depends on customers and shoppers accessing Instacart via a mobile device or, with respect to customers, a personal computer or a Connected Stores device, and the internet. We may operate in jurisdictions that provide limited internet connectivity, particularly if we expand internationally. Internet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with significant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability to access Instacart. In addition, the internet infrastructure that we and users of our offerings rely on in any particular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed, quality, and availability of Instacart. Any such failure in internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for a short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nGovernmental agencies in any of the countries in which we or our customers are located could block access to or require a license for Instacart, our mobile apps, website, or the internet generally for a number of reasons, including security, confidentiality, or regulatory concerns. In addition, companies may adopt policies that prohibit their employees from using Instacart. If companies or governmental entities block, limit, or otherwise restrict customers or shoppers from accessing Instacart, our business could be negatively impacted, the number of customers and shoppers using Instacart could decline or grow more slowly, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could be required to collect additional taxes or be subject to other tax liabilities in various jurisdictions which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business and occupation tax, commercial activity tax, business license tax, digital advertising tax, and gross receipts tax, to our business \nis a complex and evolving issue. Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and, as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business. States, localities, the U.S. federal government, and taxing authorities in other countries may seek to impose additional reporting, recordkeeping, and/or indirect tax collection obligations on our business that facilitate online commerce. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have required e-commerce platforms to calculate, collect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the internet. A majority of U.S. state jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring marketplaces to collect and remit sales taxes on sales of their third-party sellers. Tax authorities have questioned our interpretation of taxability of our business operations, and various parties have from time to time filed, and may in the future file, complaints related to our current and historical approach to treatment of our sales tax obligations and service fee disclosures. If other agencies or parties challenge our approach to treatment of our sales tax obligations and service fee disclosures, or if such agencies and parties bring novel claims under existing laws relating to these categories of indirect taxes and service fee disclosures, we could face higher sales taxes or be subject to fines or penalties, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. New legislation could also require us to incur substantial costs, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection, and remittance, and audit requirements, and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, if our employees elect to work remotely as a result of our Flex First workforce model, we may become subject to additional taxes and our compliance burdens with respect to the tax laws of additional jurisdictions may be increased.\nWe have been and may in the future also be subject to additional tax liabilities and related interest and penalties due to changes in U.S. federal, state, or international tax laws, administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles and changes to the business operations, as well as evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in prior periods. For example, if we are treated as an agent for our retail partners under U.S. state tax law, we may be primarily responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain states. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so, or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, and additional administrative expenses, which could materially harm our business. We are under audit by various state tax authorities with regard to sales tax and other indirect tax matters, primarily relating to the reporting of sales on behalf of our third-party sellers, or the tax treatment applied to the sale of our services in these jurisdictions. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition will be harmed. In addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. Such taxes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, federal tax rules generally require payors to report payments to unrelated parties to the Internal Revenue Service. Under certain circumstances, a failure to comply with such reporting obligations may cause us to become liable to withhold a percentage of the amounts paid to shoppers and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to the large number of shoppers, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these reporting obligations could result in financial liability and other consequences to us if we were unable to remedy such failures in a timely manner.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset taxable income or taxes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $19 million. We generated $5 million of net operating loss carryforwards prior to 2018, which will begin to expire in 2038. The remaining $14 million will carryforward indefinitely. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2024, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $536 million, which, if unused, will begin to expire in 2025. Portions of these net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under current law, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain whether various states will conform to federal tax laws. For state income tax purposes, there may be periods during which the use of net operating loss carryforwards is limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. For example, California imposed limits on the usability of California state net operating losses to offset taxable income in tax years beginning after 2023 and before 2027.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than \n50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We assessed whether we had an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 of the Code, from our formation through December 31, 2024. Based upon this assessment, there were no reductions in our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulted under these rules. We may experience ownership changes in the future, ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs, including as a result of or with respect to any acquisitions we make, and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (or net operating loss carryforwards that we acquire) is materially limited, it would harm our future results of operations by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of existing, new, and proposed tax laws and regulations could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nThe tax laws to which we are subject or under which we operate are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. The issuance of additional guidance related to existing or future tax laws, or changes to tax laws or regulations proposed or implemented by the current or a future U.S. presidential administration, Congress, or taxing authorities in other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions outside of the United States, could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Such changes have had and, along with any related uncertainty generated by these changes, may in the future have adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions depends on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, tax rates, new or revised tax laws, or interpretations of tax laws and policies, and our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions pursuant to our intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows, and lower overall profitability of our operations. Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency. Similarly, a taxing authority could assert that we are subject to tax in a jurisdiction where we believe we have not established a taxable connection, often referred to as a “permanent establishment” under international tax treaties, and such an assertion, if successful, could increase our expected tax liability in one or more jurisdictions.\nIn addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has published proposals covering a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules, tax treaties and taxation of the digital economy. While substantial work remains to be completed by the OECD and national governments on the implementation of these proposals, future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. domestic bribery laws, and other anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. As we increase our international sales and business, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our offerings and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of anti-corruption laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible, or that we will be able to timely detect such actions. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nDetecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls and sanctions laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate such laws.\nInstacart and our offerings are subject to U.S. import and export controls, including the Export Administration Regulations, and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our offerings. These encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an encryption classification request or self-classification report. In addition, we have immaterial operations in Asia relating to the design, engineering, and supply of Caper Carts to certain of our retail partners’ stores, whose operations are subject to import and export controls. Any adverse changes in trade relations with countries where we have such operations, such as tariff increases and import and export licensing and control requirements, could interfere with the shipment of Caper Carts to our retail partners, which could have a negative impact on future development and adoption of Caper Carts and related prospects.\nFurthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department which generally prohibit any transactions or dealings, including the provision of products and services, involving embargoed jurisdictions or sanctioned parties. Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular transaction may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Violations of U.S. sanctions or export control regulations can result in significant fines or penalties and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers.\nOur presence outside the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to additional costs and risks, and our plans may not be successful.\nWe have expanded our presence internationally. We have operations in Canada and have acquired companies that have immaterial operations in certain other countries. We expect to continue to expand our international operations and are evaluating opportunities across the world. Operating outside of the United States may require significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a variety of reasons, including:\n•challenges inherent in efficiently managing, and the increased costs associated with, an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs that are specific to each jurisdiction;\n•an inability to attract retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers;\n•competition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\n•differing demand dynamics, which may make our offerings less successful;\n•differing and potentially more onerous employment and labor regulations including with respect to worker classification and collective bargaining, where employment and labor laws are generally more advantageous to workers or employees as compared to the United States, including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;\n•complying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to privacy, data security, data protection, safety, tax, and local regulatory restrictions;\n•obtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\n•varying levels of internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\n•currency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\n•operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same extent as the United States;\n•public health concerns or emergencies may occur in various parts of the world in which we operate or may operate in the future; and\n•limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. For example, the possibility of adverse changes in trade or political relations with countries where we have operations relating to the design, engineering, and supply of Caper Carts, political instability, or increases in labor costs could interfere with the manufacturing and/or shipment of Caper Carts. We also rely on third-party manufacturers in Asia for Caper Carts, which exposes us to risks such as historically lower protection of intellectual property rights, unexpected or unfavorable changes in regulatory requirements, including the imposition by the United States of tariffs, economic sanctions, export controls, and other trade restrictions, laws, regulations, and executive orders affecting international trade and responses by foreign governments to such policies, volatility in currency exchange rates, and difficulties associated with local legal systems. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying Instacart. If these third-party elements become unavailable or unavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe convenient payment mechanisms provided by Instacart are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We rely on third parties for elements of our payment processing infrastructure to accept payments from customers and remit payments to retailers and shoppers, including certain Instacart-branded programs. These third parties may refuse to renew our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, Android Pay™, and Apple Pay®, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased fees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs on to us. If these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to shoppers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, which caused substantial shopper dissatisfaction and generated a significant number of shopper complaints. Future failures of the payment processing infrastructure underlying Instacart could cause shoppers to lose trust in our payment operations and could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms. If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure declines as a result of these limitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to retailers, consumers, and shoppers could be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by retailers, consumers, or shoppers.\nWe rely on software and services from other parties. Defects in, or the loss of or disruption of access to, software or services from third parties could harm our business and adversely affect the quality of Instacart.\nOur offerings incorporate certain third-party software obtained pursuant to licenses or service agreements from other companies, including but not limited to, software and services related to our background checks, data visualization, mapping, and database tools. Such third parties may discontinue their products or services, cease to provide their products or service to us, go out of business, or otherwise cease to provide support for such products or services in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software or services we currently license or receive, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace existing third-party software or find a replacement third-party service. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software or services would require us \nto engage with third parties, and we may not be able to enter into agreements with such third parties on advantageous terms. In addition, integration of the software used in our offerings with new third-party software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources. To the extent that our offerings depend upon the successful operation of third-party software, any undetected errors or defects in, or disruptions to the functionality of, such third-party software have in the past and could in the future prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our offerings, delay new offering introductions, result in a failure of our offerings, and injure our reputation, which in each case could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host or support a significant portion of Instacart technology infrastructure and data, and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our offerings and harm our business.\nWe currently host Instacart technology infrastructure and data and support our operations using a combination of a small number of third-party service providers. We do not have control over the operations of the facilities of the hosting providers that we use, and these third-party operations and co-located data centers may experience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service or other cyber-attacks or security incidents, sabotage, acts of vandalism, outages, disruptions, and other misconduct or incidents that impact the services provided to us. These facilities may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. Any such limitation on the capacity of our third-party service providers could impede our ability to provide services to our customers and retail and brand partners, onboard new customers, expand the usage of our existing customers, or effectively detect or respond to other issues with our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. A prolonged service disruption affecting our service for any of the foregoing reasons would negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the third-party service providers we use.\nIn addition, any changes in our hosting provider’s service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the expectations of retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers. Our systems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party service providers to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or require us to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or public cloud computing service. This could be time-consuming and costly and may result in the loss of data, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch to another public cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other public cloud and data center providers are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and providers of our co-located data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on commercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is arranged, and any business interruptions that impact the delivery of our offerings as a result of these delays may reduce our revenue, cause retailers and shoppers to stop offering their services through Instacart, and reduce use of our offerings by customers. In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computational capacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new offerings on Instacart may be delayed or compromised, which would have an adverse effect on our growth and business.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and app marketplaces to make portions of Instacart available to retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers, and if we do not effectively operate with such app marketplaces, our usage or brand recognition could decline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective app marketplaces to make Instacart available to retailers, customers, brands, and shoppers. Any changes in such systems and app marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our apps or give preferential treatment to our competitors’ apps could adversely affect Instacart’s usage on mobile devices. If such mobile operating systems or app marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our apps available to retailers, customers, brands, or shoppers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our apps, change the way we collect or use data, increase the cost of using our apps, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, alter \nhow we collect fees, increase our compliance costs, impair or inhibit our ability to enter into partnerships or effectively market partnerships, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’ app marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our apps, our growth could slow. Our apps have experienced fluctuations in placement in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Additionally, we are subject to requirements imposed by app marketplaces such as those operated by Apple and Google, who have and may further change their technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we collect, use and share data from users. For example, Apple requires mobile applications using its iOS mobile operating system to obtain a user’s permission to track them or access their device’s advertising identifier for certain purposes. The long-term impact of these and any other changes remains uncertain. If we do not comply with applicable requirements imposed by app marketplaces, we could lose access to the app marketplaces and users, and our business would be harmed. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to support our apps or that we can effectively roll out updates to our app. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need to ensure that Instacart is designed to work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. If retailers, customers, brands, or shoppers that utilize Instacart encounter any difficulty accessing or using our apps on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, we expect that our growth and engagement would be adversely affected.\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to insure our operations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to cover various operations-related risks including automobile liability, employment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, errors and omissions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident insurance for shoppers, and general business liabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving offerings, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. Even if we do acquire insurance for our operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services and offerings, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such risks, and we may have to pay high premiums, co-insurance, self-insured retentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. If any of our insurance providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure similar coverage on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If any of our insurance providers change the terms of our policies in a manner not favorable to us or to shoppers, our insurance costs could increase. If the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, or if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, we could be liable for significant additional costs. Further, if any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we would bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured retentions, co-insurance, or otherwise paid by us. Insurance providers have raised premiums, deductibles, and self-insured retentions for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance costs and claims expense have increased and could further increase, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if the cost per claim, premiums, the severity of claims, or the number of claims exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits; we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits; our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims; we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided; or the severity or number of claims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions and insurance reserves as our experience develops or if we receive new information. We employ various predictive modeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on historical claim and loss experience and industry statistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. Additionally, actuarial projections make no provision for the extraordinary future emergence of losses or types of losses not sufficiently represented in the historical data or which are \nnot yet quantifiable. While an independent actuarial firm periodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness and provides claims reserve valuations, a number of external factors can affect the actual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open, increases in healthcare costs, increases in automotive costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected events such as natural or human-made catastrophic disasters. Such factors can also impact our insurance reserves and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determine that our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could negatively impact our financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to certain contractual requirements to obtain insurance. For example, some of our agreements with retailers require that we procure certain types of insurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of these retailer agreements. In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with existing or future local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Additionally, anticipated or future local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage, could require additional fees and costs. Compliance with these rules and any related lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately maintain and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, know-how, and our brand. To protect our rights to our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, domain name registrations, confidentiality agreements, and other contractual arrangements with our employees, affiliates, clients, strategic partners, and others. However, the protective steps we have taken and plan to take may be inadequate to deter infringement, misappropriation, dilution or other violations of our intellectual property rights. We make business decisions about when and where to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright or trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where we seek patent protection, there is no assurance that our applications for patents will be granted, and even if they are, that the resulting patents will be of sufficient scope to provide meaningful protection. Further, even if we obtain adequate protection, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our patents and other intellectual property rights. Effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us or in every jurisdiction in which we offer or intend to offer our services and, in addition, the output of AIML tools we utilize may not be eligible for copyright protection. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability, registration, ownership or scope of our intellectual property rights, and defending against any such claims could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary technology and develop and commercialize substantially identical offerings or technologies. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights that we have or may obtain may be challenged or circumvented by others or invalidated or held unenforceable through administrative process, including re-examination, inter partes review, interference and derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings), or litigation. Despite our pending U.S. patent applications, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents, or even if issued, that such patents would be of sufficient scope to provide meaningful protection. Even if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may be unable to obtain or maintain patent protection for our technology. In addition, any patents we have or may obtain, or that are licensed to us now or in the future, may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, \ntrade secrets, and intellectual property may be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our offerings and technology capabilities and use information that we regard as proprietary to create offerings that compete with ours. The value of our trademarks could be diminished if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks, or if they use and assert rights in trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. In some cases, litigation or other actions may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction.\nWe enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with other third parties, including suppliers and other partners. However, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to our proprietary information, know-how, and trade secrets. Moreover, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to our proprietary information or the distribution, use, misuse, misappropriation, reverse engineering, or disclosure of our proprietary information, know-how, and trade secrets. Further, these agreements may not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our offerings and technology capabilities. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor for infringement and to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Further, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, and if such defenses, counterclaims, or countersuits are successful, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our offerings and technology capabilities, impair the functionality of our offerings and technology capabilities, delay introductions of new offerings, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our offerings, or injure our reputation.\nWe may not be able to successfully halt the operations of copycat websites or the infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights in Instacart, or elements or functionality embodied therein, including, but not limited to, our digital catalog. From time to time, third parties have accessed Instacart’s servers without authorization and misappropriated our digital catalog through website scraping, “bots,” web crawlers, or other tools or means. In addition, copycat websites have imitated or attempted to imitate elements or functionality of Instacart. As a result, we have employed technological and legal measures, including initiating lawsuits, in an attempt to halt such infringement or misappropriation. We expect such activities to continue to occur. However, we may not be able to detect all such activities in a timely manner and, even if we do, we cannot guarantee that our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be successful. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against these websites or third parties, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, party to intellectual property disputes, which are costly and may subject us to significant liability and increased costs of doing business.\nWe have in the past been, are currently in, and may in the future become subject to intellectual property disputes. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our offerings without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of third parties. However, we may not be aware that our offerings are infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating third-party intellectual property rights, and such third parties may bring claims alleging such infringement, misappropriation, or violation. For example, we rely on a combination of third-party intellectual property licenses and the fair use doctrine when we refer to third-party intellectual property, such as brand names and product images, on Instacart. Third parties may dispute the scope of those rights or the applicability of the fair-use doctrine or otherwise challenge our ability to reference their intellectual property in the course of our business. From time to time, we are contacted by companies controlling brands of products that are sold by retailers, demanding that we cease referencing those brands or take down product images on Instacart. Additionally, companies in the internet and technology industries, and other patent holders, including “non-practicing entities,” seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses or seeking to obtain injunctions, own large numbers of patents and other intellectual property and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. To reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in intellectual property disputes, we may need to establish new intellectual property agreements or renew existing licenses. However, this strategy of cross-licensing our patent portfolio with third \nparties in order to settle infringement claims brought against us may not be appropriate in the future and is not effective against certain patent owners, such as non-practicing entities.\nOther parties have asserted, and in the future may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend, cause us to cease using or incorporating the asserted intellectual property rights, divert management’s attention and resources, and expose us to other legal liabilities, such as indemnification obligations. We could be required to pay substantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing or be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property. Any such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could result in us being required to pay significant damages or enter into costly license or royalty agreements, either of which could have an adverse impact on our business. The technology industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights. Companies in the technology industry are often required to defend against litigation claims based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use. In addition, some companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Relative to certain of our competitors, we do not currently have a large patent portfolio, and our relative patent portfolio size may reduce the deterrence value of our portfolio against patent infringement claims brought by competitors or other entities with larger portfolios. Our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have. If a third party is able to obtain an injunction preventing us from accessing such third-party intellectual property rights, or if we cannot license or develop alternative technology for any potentially infringing aspect of our business, we could be forced to rebrand our offerings, limit, or stop sales of our offerings and technology capabilities, or cease business activities related to such intellectual property. Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. We cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits and cannot ensure that the results of any such actions will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Any intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:\n•cease selling or using offerings that incorporate the intellectual property rights that we allegedly infringe, misappropriate, or violate;\n•make substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments, or other costs or damages;\n•obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or\n•redesign the allegedly infringing offerings to avoid infringement, misappropriation, or violation, which could be costly, time-consuming, or impossible.\nEven if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and results of operations. Moreover, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. We expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the market for Instacart and our offerings grows. Accordingly, our exposure to damages resulting from infringement claims could increase, and this could further exhaust our financial and management resources.\nOur use of third-party open-source software could adversely affect our ability to offer Instacart and our offerings and subjects us to possible litigation.\nWe use third-party open-source software in connection with the operation, development, and deployment of Instacart and our offerings. From time to time, companies that use third-party open-source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open-source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open-source license. We may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open-source software or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open-source licensing terms. Some open-source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open-source software to make available the source code of all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code, and also prohibit the charging of fees to licensees for use of such code. While we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open-source software and to shield our valuable proprietary source code from these open-source \nlicense requirements, we have not run a complete open-source license review and may inadvertently use third-party open-source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, that could require us to disclose source code of our proprietary software, prohibit us from charging fees for use of our proprietary software, or render our software temporarily unavailable. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open-source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code, expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software, or temporarily disable one or more features of our platform.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open-source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open-source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise Instacart. Additionally, because any software source code that we contribute to open-source projects becomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial condition, or results of operations and could help our competitors develop offerings that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile and could decline significantly and rapidly.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors in addition to the ones described in this “Risk Factors” section many of which are beyond our control, including:\n•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations and growth rates;\n•the number of shares of our common stock made available for trading;\n•overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole;\n•changes in the financial projections we may provide to the public and/or our failure to meet these projections;\n•failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n•changes in the pricing of our offerings;\n•actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to that of our competitors;\n•changes in the anticipated future size or growth rate of our addressable markets;\n•announcements of new products, or of acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital-raising activities or commitments, by us or by our competitors;\n•repurchases or expectations with respect to repurchases of our common stock by us;\n•additions or departures of board members, management, or key personnel;\n•rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n•new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business, including those related to consumer protection, privacy, data security, data protection, and cyber security in the United States or globally;\n•administrative actions, government investigations, lawsuits, and other legal and regulatory proceedings threatened or initiated against us;\n•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events;\n•health epidemics, such as influenza, and other highly infectious diseases; \n•the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, including the S&P 400 Index, to which we were recently added; and\n•sales or expectations with respect to sales of shares of our capital stock by us or our security holders.\nIn addition, stock prices of many companies, including technology companies, have fluctuated in a manner often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price for their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, we are currently subject to a class action lawsuit in federal court alleging federal securities law violations in connection with our IPO. This current litigation, any related litigation that may arise, and any securities litigation that may be instituted against us in the future, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales, directly or indirectly of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Many of our existing equity holders have substantial unrecognized gains on the value of the equity they hold, and therefore, may take steps to sell their shares or otherwise secure the unrecognized gains on those shares. We are unable to predict the timing of or the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nFurther, certain holders of our capital stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase program, and any failure to repurchase our common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock price.\nIn November 2023, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to $500 million of our common stock, at management’s discretion, which was subsequently increased to $1 billion in February 2024 and used in its entirety during 2024. In June 2024, we announced that our board of directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program, which was subsequently increased to $750 million in November 2024. Repurchases under this new program may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our common stock under this authorization.\nThe timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. The program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us, or our stock price.\nThe existence of our share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock, and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in our stock price. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchase shares, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the program. Repurchasing our common stock reduces the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or investments, other business opportunities, and other general corporate projects, as well as to invest in securities to generate returns on our cash balance. We also may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of any share repurchase program.\nIn addition, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the United States implemented a 1% excise tax on the value of certain stock repurchases by publicly traded companies. This tax has in the past increased and may in the future increase the costs to us of any share repurchases.\nOur executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, continue to have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval. Furthermore, certain of our current directors were initially appointed by our principal stockholders.\nOur executive officers, directors, and greater than 5% stockholders, in the aggregate, beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock. Furthermore, certain of our current directors were initially appointed by our principal stockholders. As a result, such persons or their appointees to our board of directors, acting together, will have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted to our board of directors or stockholders for approval, including the appointment of our management, the election and removal of directors, and approval of any significant transaction, as well as our management and business affairs. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our business, even if such a transaction would benefit other stockholders.\nOur business and financial performance may differ from any projections that we disclose or any information that may be attributed to us by third parties.\nFrom time to time, we may provide guidance via public disclosures regarding our projected business or financial performance. However, any such projections involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from such projections. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified in this “Risk Factors” section, some or all of which are not predictable or within our control. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could adversely impact our performance, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any projections, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as may be required by law. In addition, various news sources, bloggers, market research firms, and other publishers often make statements regarding our historical or projected business or financial performance, and we cannot assure you of the reliability of any such information even if it is attributed directly or indirectly to us.\nWe could experience volatility in our trading price and trading volume if securities or industry analysts cease to publish research about our business, or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research.\nWe do not have any control over the content and opinions included in reports published by equity research analysts, and we cannot assure you that any equity research analysts will continue to adequately provide research coverage of our common stock. A lack of adequate research coverage at any time may harm the liquidity and trading price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts cease coverage of our company, or fail to regularly publish reports on us, the demand for our common stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our trading price to decline and/or or trading volumes to fluctuate.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Any future determination to pay dividends on our capital stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock is limited by the terms of our Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) and may be further restricted under future contractual arrangements. Accordingly, you must rely on the sale of your common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gain on your investment.\nAdditional stock issuances could result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may issue our capital stock or securities convertible into our capital stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments, or otherwise. Additional issuances of our capital stock will result in dilution to existing stockholder. Also, to the extent outstanding stock options to purchase our stock are exercised, RSUs settle, or our Series A Preferred Stock is converted, there will be further dilution. The amount of dilution could be substantial depending upon the size of the issuance. Any such issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock, impacts our ability to pay dividends, and may result in significant dilution.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock. Accordingly, in the event of our liquidation or dissolution in bankruptcy or otherwise, the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock would receive their liquidation preference prior to any distribution being available to holders of our common stock. The terms of our Series A Preferred Stock also require us to obtain approval from the holders of the outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock for any cash dividends on our common stock in excess of a 5.0% annual dividend yield. Any dividend payment on our common stock will also result in adjustments to the conversion price of our Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, upon a conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, your percentage ownership in us will be diluted.\nCertain provisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or hinder attempts by our stockholders to change our management or to acquire a controlling interest in us, or bring a lawsuit against us or our directors and officers, and the trading price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control were considered favorable by our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:\n•a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n•the ability of our board of directors to determine the number of directors and to fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n•a requirement that our directors may only be removed for cause;\n•a prohibition on cumulative voting for directors;\n•the requirement of a super-majority to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n•authorization of the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; and\n•an inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and a prohibition on stockholder actions by written consent, thereby requiring that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a three-year period beginning on the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Any provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIn addition, the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n•any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n•any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n•any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;\n•any action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;\n•any action as to which Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\n•any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid and several state trial courts have enforced such provisions and required that suits asserting Securities Act claims be filed in federal court, there is no guarantee that courts of appeal will affirm the enforceability of such provisions, and a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such an instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with litigating Securities Act claims in state court, or both state and federal court, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management’s attention, and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing standards of Nasdaq Global Select Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. Furthermore, several members of our management team do not have prior experience in running a public company. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations. As a result of the complexity involved in complying with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, our management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we have already hired additional employees to assist us in complying with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our operating expenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs, and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We have invested and intend to continue investing substantial resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from business operations to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities \nrelated to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. Being subject to these new rules and regulations has made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we have incurred substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly members who can serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of the disclosure obligations required of a public company, our business and financial condition are more visible, which may result in an increased risk of threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, would divert the resources of our management and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts. We have established an internal audit group, and as we continue to grow, we will hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and update the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations, harm our results of operations, or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Additionally, if we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. The accounting for our business is complex, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in SEC or other agency policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model and accounting methods, principles, or interpretations could result in changes to our financial statements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in materially different financial results, and may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting controls.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.” The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses. Significant estimates and judgments involve: revenue recognition, including revenue-related reserves; legal and loss contingencies; and income taxes. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock. Additionally, incorrect judgments may cause errors in our financial statements that could result in corrections to or restatements of our historical financial statements, cause delays in the preparation and filing of our periodic reports as well as failures to meet our reporting and other obligations as a public company, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",
