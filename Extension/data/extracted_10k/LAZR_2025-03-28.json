      "text": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nOverview \nLuminar is a technology company specializing in advanced Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) hardware and software solutions to enable the world’s safest and smartest vehicles. Over the past decade, Luminar has been developing proprietary LiDAR hardware, core semiconductor components and software in-house to meet the demanding performance, safety, reliability and cost requirements to enable next-generation safety and autonomous capabilities for passenger and commercial vehicles, as well as other adjacent markets.\nThe global automotive and mobility sector is increasingly focused on safety and autonomy, specifically next-generation advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS, and highway autonomy for passenger and commercial vehicles. Our LiDAR technology provides increased situational awareness in a broad range of driving environments through improved and higher confidence detection and planning at all vehicle speeds. Beyond sensor hardware, our product portfolio has expanded to include semiconductor components of our LiDAR that have utility in adjacent markets, in-development software capabilities such as perception and high-definition “3D” mapping, all of which we anticipate will monetize the ecosystem of improved safety and autonomy created by our LiDAR.\nOur Markets \nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (“SAE”) defines levels of vehicle automation as follows, which SAE updates from time to time:\n•Level 0—No Driving Automation: In this level, the human is fully responsible for all dynamic driving tasks (“DDT”) at all times, even if an active safety system assists in the task. “L0” is defined as driver support features that are limited to warnings or momentary emergency intervention. Examples of warnings include blind spot warning or lane departure warnings. Examples of features with momentary assistance include automated emergency braking (“AEB”) and lane keep assist (“LKA”).\n•Level 1—Driver Assistance: In this level, while the human is fully responsible for all DDT at all times, an active safety system may assist by executing either the longitudinal or the lateral vehicle motion control subtask, and disengages immediately upon driver request. Examples include lane centering support (“LCS”) or the more widely adopted adaptive cruise control (“ACC”). These features are viewed as comfort features, easing the driving load from the driver during extended highway drives.\n•Level 2—Partial Driving Automation: In this level, the human is fully responsible for all DDT at all times, even if an active safety system assists in the task. When the controls from an L1 system are operated by the vehicle simultaneously, such as LCS and ACC, the system is then classified as L2.\nThe term L2+, while not an officially recognized term, is often used for today’s higher capability L2 systems, many of which add a driver monitoring system, such as camera or steering wheel sensing to ensure the human driver remains engaged, but require that the driver remain attentive at all times. This is considered by safety experts as a challenging phase because the systems may work well for long periods of time, and can lull drivers into trust and complacency.\n•Level 3—Conditional Driving Automation: In this level, the automated driving system (“ADS”) performs the entire DDT while engaged. The driver is responsible to verify the operational readiness of the ADS, determine whether to engage the system, and becomes the fallback-ready user when the ADS is engaged. The ADS permits engagement and operation only within its operational design domain (“ODD”). However, the ODD is often limited to highway applications within certain speed parameters. An example is a traffic jam assist feature that allows the driver to stop paying attention for short periods of time at lower speeds.\n• Level 4—High Driving Automation: In this level, the ADS performs the entire DDT while engaged. The driver is responsible to verify the operational readiness of the ADS, determine whether to engage the system, and becomes a passenger when the ADS is engaged (when physically present in the vehicle). The ADS permits engagement and operation only within its ODD. The ODD is expanded in this level to include numerous different driving environments, such as highway and urban. \n•Level 5—Full Driving Automation: In this level, the ADS performs the entire DDT while engaged. It is the designation for vehicles that, when placed in automated driving mode, can drive everywhere and in all conditions without human intervention or even occupants. \nWe believe the market is currently segmented in two distinct categories: (1) ADAS (L0 / L1 / L2 / L2+) and (2) autonomous driving, or AD, (L3 / L4 / L5). Within these two segments, we believe the largest near-term business opportunities \nTable of Contents\n\nexist for technologies that enhance, not replace, the driver, specifically in ADAS (L2+) and conditional highway autonomy applications (L3). We believe our products meaningfully improve ADAS functionality and are also key enablers for highway autonomy. \nADAS and Proactive SafetyTM\nADAS standards are primarily driven by both the European and North American markets. The European New Car Assessment Program (“NCAP”), a voluntary vehicle safety performance assessment program that uses a star safety rating system, requires a minimum level of crash mitigation functionality such as automatic emergency braking (“AEB”) (for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists), lane keep assist (“LKA”), speed alert systems and other ADAS features for a vehicle to have a 5-star rating. Furthermore, we believe the European Union may be moving toward mandates of certain of these advanced functions. \nUntil recently, the United States (“U.S.”) was less focused on mandates and instead allowed the U.S. New Car Assessment Program (known as the “Stars on Cars” program) and designations such as the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety “Top Safety Pick” and “Top Safety Pick+” to drive adoption of vehicles with ADAS technologies and provide consumers with an understanding of a vehicle’s crash avoidance capability. In 2020, in conjunction with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), 20 automakers announced a voluntary effort to equip almost all new passenger vehicles sold in the US with a low-speed AEB system, including forward-collision warning, by mid-2023.\nIn 2024, NHTSA published a Final Rule adopting new Federal Motor Safety Standard No. 127, which mandates advanced higher speed, no-contact AEB and Pedestrian AEB (“PAEB”) systems on new cars and light trucks. All new vehicles must comply with all requirements in this Final Rule by 2029. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”) may also follow NHTSA’s effort, as FMCSA had also introduced proposed rulemaking in 2023 with NHTSA to mandate AEB in heavy trucks. These new safety standards will likely require additional hardware and software to meet performance requirements.\nWith global safety rating programs being the main drivers of adoption and pressure on original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) competing to deliver more safety and comfort features to their customers, we believe it is reasonable to expect near complete adoption of at least some ADAS functionalities in new vehicles manufactured and sold in developed markets such as Europe, the United States, Japan, and South Korea by 2026. We expect adoption rates to increase significantly in China as well. \nAccording to the World Health Organization, the number of fatalities globally on roadways still exceeds one million annually and the global macroeconomic costs of vehicle accidents has been estimated at more than $1 trillion globally. While the increasing application of existing ADAS features should help reduce the number of accidents and fatalities, we believe there is significant room for improvement in these technologies. In particular, we believe there is a significant opportunity to reduce collisions with a capable LiDAR sensing system that increases the quality and reliability of the perception data collected by vehicles and enables improved ADAS functionality in a wider range of environmental conditions, such as at higher speeds and at night. \nWe have been developing a turn-key ADAS system known as Proactive SafetyTM, which leverages our core LiDAR hardware and software technologies. Intended functionality for Proactive SafetyTM that is currently under development includes AEB, automatic emergency steering, and ACC. If implemented, we expect these functionalities to represent a new generation of vehicle safety that enables more accident avoidance rather than merely mitigation of crash severity.\nHighway Autonomy \nOur focus since inception has been to enable ubiquitous vehicle safety and autonomy. We view Highway Autonomy, in combination with Proactive SafetyTM, as providing the most value to the end consumer of vehicles for the foreseeable future. The market appears to be trending in this direction, targeting hands-off and eyes-off operations in a more controlled setting, such as highways, than the highly complex urban environment. \nHistorically, there was a significant focus on investment and development of Level 4 robo-taxi solutions; however, this is proving to be a much more complex and expensive challenge to solve than many companies anticipated. As a result, in the past few years, the industry experienced a retrenching of efforts in the robo-taxi space, which we believe has validated our focus from the outset on improving ADAS functionality and enabling highway autonomy. We continue to believe that the passenger vehicles and commercial vehicle sectors focused on L2+/L3 applications will be the greatest source of demand for our products over the next several years. \nPassenger Vehicle Market\nThe passenger vehicle market is very large. We expect that approximately 100 million new passenger and commercial vehicles will be manufactured annually, on average, through the end of this decade. The automotive industry is looking to achieve widespread adoption of next-generation safety and autonomous features in all vehicles for the benefits of safety, economics, and accessibility of transportation. We expect a ramp up of LiDAR and our technology adoption over time as \nTable of Contents\n\nADAS and autonomous functionalities mature, hardware costs and prices are reduced, and consumers become more familiar with the full benefits and capabilities of a safe autonomy system. As such, we believe there is a substantial market opportunity for our LiDAR products in the passenger vehicle segment.\nCommercial Trucking Market \nThe amount of goods transported by trucking globally continues to rise year-over-year. The application of ADAS technology continues to grow and the interest in autonomy for commercial transport remains high. The business case for trucking highway autonomy beyond improved safety also includes: lower operating costs, increased vehicle utilization, and more time spent on the road. Although the number of commercial vehicles manufactured annually is a fraction of passenger vehicles, we believe commercial vehicles require more sensor hardware to enable a similar level of ADAS and autonomous functionalities; for example, 2+ LiDARs per commercial truck versus 1 per passenger vehicle. As such, we believe there is also a substantial market opportunity for our LiDAR products in the commercial trucking segment. \nRobo-Taxi Market \nThe robo-taxi industry remains an area of investment and development by leading technology companies and mainstays from the automotive industry. The timeline for widespread deployment of robo-taxies continues to be pushed out due to the complexity of the technical requirements, specifically a sensing and compute solution that must anticipate every possible mixed-traffic scenario, as well as the need for regional and federal government support and funding for infrastructure. With this, there has been a near-term contraction and retrenchment of industry participants in the robo-taxi market. However, we continue to believe the robo-taxi market segment remains an important market for LiDAR, both for near-term validation and for long-term demand. \nAdjacent Markets \nAdjacent markets, including but not limited to last mile delivery, aerospace and defense, robotics and security offer additional use cases for which our technology is well suited. Our goal is to scale first within our core markets and utilize our robust solutions to best serve these adjacent markets where it makes sense for us and our partners.\nOur Products \nOur LiDAR and other products are described in further detail below:\nHardware\nIris:  Our Iris LiDAR and variants combine a 1550nm laser, transmitter, and receiver and provide long-range sensing that we expect will meet OEM specifications for advanced safety and autonomy. This technology provides automotive-grade, efficient, and affordable solutions that are scalable, reliable, and optimal for series production. Our LiDAR sensors are dynamically configurable dual-axis scan sensors that detect objects up to 600 meters away over a horizontal field of view of 120° and a software configurable vertical field of view of up to 30°. This provides high point densities in excess of 200 points per square degree that enables long-range detection, tracking, and classification over the whole field of view. Iris and its variants have been refined to meet the size, weight, cost, power, and reliability requirements of automotive qualified series production sensors.\nIris and its variants feature our vertically integrated receiver, detector, and application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) solutions that have been developed by our Advanced Technologies & Services (“ATS”) segment companies—Optogration, Freedom Photonics, and Black Forest Engineering, collectively referred to as Luminar Semiconductor, Inc. (“Luminar Semiconductor” or “LSI”). We refer to the internal development of these key sub-component technologies as our “chip-level up” strategy, which we believe gives us a significant advantage in the development of our product roadmap and a competitive moat in the LiDAR industry.\nIn April 2024, we achieved our start of production (“SOP”) for Volvo Cars and began delivering our Iris LiDAR sensors for the Volvo EX90. Our LiDAR sensors on initial vehicles are first being used for road data collection and system training, and will later be activated as part of the vehicle’s active safety system.\nLuminar Halo:  In 2024, we unveiled our next-generation LiDAR product, Luminar Halo, which is being designed for mass adoption by mainstream consumer vehicles. Building off the same 1550nm laser architecture of Iris, Luminar Halo will incorporate four next-generation chip technologies from Luminar Semiconductor. These advancements are expected to enable a 4x improvement in performance, a 3x reduction in size, a 2x improvement in thermal efficiency, and more than a 2x improvement in cost. Luminar Halo is being designed to provide backwards system compatibility to existing customers of our Iris LiDAR. We expect it will also boast a sleeker integration profile, being under 1 inch in height, under 1 kilogram in weight, and using approximately 10 watts of power consumption. We are currently targeting SOP of Luminar Halo by 2027.\nTable of Contents\n\nWe recently began transitioning from investing and developing multiple LiDAR hardware products simultaneously to meet different customers’ needs to a singular technology platform – Luminar Halo – that can meet all customer requirements. As part of this effort, we discontinued development of our Iris+ product, and essentially all our engineering and development efforts with customers are shifting to Luminar Halo. This narrowing of product scope is intended to further streamline our business model to drive efficient execution and reduce costs.\nLuminar Semiconductor, Inc.\nIn 2023, we announced the combination of our chip design subsidiary companies, Black Forest Engineering, Optogration, and Freedom Photonics, into a unified entity, Luminar Semiconductor, Inc. Our strategy in bringing these advanced receiver, laser, and processing chip technologies in-house was to accelerate our LiDAR product roadmap, strengthen our competitive moat, and secure and industrialize our LiDAR supply chain. With these acquisitions, Luminar Semiconductor aims to leverage our investment in high-performance, specialized semiconductors beyond LiDAR to power applications for customers across a broad range of sectors from communications to medical to aerospace. \nIn 2024, we augmented Luminar Semiconductor with the acquisition of EM4, LLC (“EM4”), a designer, manufacturer, and seller of packaged photonic components and sub-systems for aerospace and industrial markets, which is expected to accelerate our strategy to package lasers, detectors, and ASICs.\nOperations of Luminar Semiconductor, and the acquired companies Black Forest Engineering, Optogration, Freedom Photonics and EM4 have been included in our ATS segment of reporting since their respective acquisition dates.\nSoftware \nSoftware presently under development includes the following:\nCore Sensor Software:  Our LiDAR sensors are configurable and capture valuable information extracted from the raw point-cloud that can be used to promote the development and performance of perception software. Our core sensor software features are being designed to help our commercial partners to operate, integrate, and control our LiDAR sensors, and enrich the sensor data stream before perception processing. \nPerception and Mapping Software: Our perception software is being designed to transform our LiDAR point-cloud data into actionable information about the environment surrounding the vehicle. This information includes classifying static objects, such as lane markings, road surface, curbs, signs and buildings, as well as dynamic objects, such as, other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and animals. Through internal development, as well as the acquisition of certain assets of Solfice (a.k.a. Civil Maps), we expect to be able to utilize our point-cloud data to achieve precise vehicle localization and create and provide continuous updates to a high definition 3D map of a vehicle’s environment.\nDriving Functions Software: Driving functions software builds on Core Sensor Software and Perception capabilities to deliver control functions for a vehicle to avoid or mitigate collision. Driving functions are expected to also incorporate data from radars and cameras to enable additional features, such as cross traffic collision avoidance, traffic sign assist, emergency braking, and emergency steering.\nTools/Other: These products include delivery of certain data sets and other information as well as tools that help visualize and configure the sensor, replay recorded data, and simulate the sensor. \nWe refer to our full-stack software platform for safety and autonomy that is expected to enable Proactive SafetyTM and highway autonomy for passenger vehicles and commercial trucks as “Sentinel”. \nSubstantially all our software products remain in the designing and coding phase of development and have not yet achieved technological feasibility.\nCompetition \nThe market for LiDAR-enabled vehicle features, on- and off-road, is an emerging one with many potential applications in the development stage. As a result, we face competition in the LiDAR hardware business from a range of companies seeking to have their products incorporated into these applications. We believe we hold a strong position based on our hardware product performance and maturity, as well as our growing ability to develop deeply integrated software capabilities needed to provide safety and autonomous features to our customers. Historically, we have also faced competition from Tier 1 suppliers that have pursued various LiDAR investments or partnerships; however, many of these efforts have abated over the past few years, and a number of Tier 1 suppliers have exited or abandoned their LiDAR development efforts.\nThe majority of our competitors in the LiDAR hardware space are focused on a lower-performance segment due to limitations of their technology, whereas we remain focused on a high-performance segment, as measured by Range-X-Resolution, or more specifically the distance up to which objects can be detected by the LiDAR and the point densities of the objects being detected to reliably track and classify them over the most optimal field of view.\nTable of Contents\n\nMore specifically, all LiDARs utilize a laser with a specific wavelength; each with its own unique physics constraints. Current LiDARs and future roadmaps for LiDARs are primarily 1550nm or 905/940nm. Luminar’s LiDAR operates at 1550nm, while most of our LiDAR competitors operate at 9XXnm, and 1550nm offers superior performance over its 9XXnm counterparts in virtually every measure. These include:\nEye Safety: 905nm wavelength lasers operate at a wavelength that is closer to that which is visible by the human eye, and thus can cause eye damage. 1550nm wavelength lasers, however, can emit 17 times the number of photons into the environment, on average, than is allowed from those below 1000nm (such as, 905nm and 940nm) and still remain eye safe. This means 1550nm LiDAR has the potential for substantially better resolution and detection range, as compared to a 9XXnm LiDAR.\nInclement Weather: LiDAR wavelength performance in weather is fairly complicated, but on the whole, 1550nm wavelength performs best overall due to both the eye safety benefit and favorable range degradation physics.\nSolar Radiation: Significantly more sunlight reaches the earth at 905nm than at 940nm or 1550nm, meaning the “floor” for detection of 905nm systems is much higher than its counterparts. As higher levels of sunlight decreases a LiDAR’s ability to detect objects, 1550nm and 940nm systems have a major sensitivity advantage over 905nm systems.\nAdditionally, production of LiDAR uses parts developed specifically for the demands of the use case. While 9XXnm LiDAR is built on parts intended for consumer applications, 1550nm LiDAR leverages parts intended for aerospace, defense, and telecommunications applications that can be leveraged for automotive applications. In other words, 9XX begins with a cost benefit, but must catch up on performance and robustness, while 1550nm begins with a performance and robustness benefit and must catch up on cost. Different wavelengths require different semiconductor materials for detection. 9XXnm systems are detected by silicon, a common single-element selected for its availability due to the infrastructure of the camera semiconductor industry rather than its suitability for use in automotive applications. 1550nm detection requires Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs), an alloy consisting of less readily available materials that ultimately provide superior performance in automotive applications.\nCompetition within the LiDAR hardware space is also bifurcated between Chinese versus Western companies. The China market and Chinese automakers have generally been earlier adopters of LiDAR technology for integration into vehicle platforms than automakers in the Western markets. As a result, the Chinese LiDAR companies have enjoyed economies of scale and associated better sensor economics in a way that Western LiDAR companies, including Luminar, have yet to achieve. However, as LiDAR penetration in the Western market increases, this cost advantage should lessen or dissipate.\nWithin the automotive autonomy software space, the competitive landscape is still nascent and has primarily been focused on developing Level 4-5 autonomous capabilities for robo-taxi or other applications, as opposed to active safety or autonomous features for Level 2-3 capabilities in passenger vehicles. Other autonomous software providers include in-house OEM software teams; automotive silicon providers; large technology companies; and newer technology companies focused on autonomous software. We partner with certain autonomous software providers to provide our LiDAR and other products into the passenger vehicle, commercial truck, and robo-taxi markets.\nBeyond the automotive markets, the adjacent markets, including but not limited to last mile delivery, aerospace and defense, robotics, and security, among others, are highly competitive. There are entrenched incumbents and competitors, including from China, many of which have low cost products that are widely available.\nIntellectual Property \nOur success and competitive advantage depend in part upon our ability to develop and protect our core technology and intellectual property. We own a portfolio of intellectual property, including patents and registered trademarks, confidential technical information, and expertise in the development of LiDAR technology and software for our end markets. \nWe have filed patent and trademark applications in order to further secure these rights and strengthen our ability to defend against third parties who may infringe on our rights. Additionally, we protect our proprietary rights through agreements with our commercial partners, supply-chain vendors, employees, and consultants, as well as close monitoring of the developments and products in the industry. \nAs of February 2025, we had 222 issued patents (191 U.S. and 31 international), 197 pending applications (127 U.S. and 70 international), of which five U.S. application has been allowed. In addition, as of February 2025, we had six registered U.S. trademarks, 103 registered foreign trademarks and 61 pending trademark applications. \nManufacturing Process\nWe design certain critical semiconductor components in-house, including our receiver ASIC and Indium Gallium Arsenide (“InGaAs”) photodiode.\nTable of Contents\n\nIn 2021, we executed contract manufacturing services agreements to enable series production of our Iris LiDAR sensors with Celestica and Fabrinet, whereby Fabrinet is responsible for assembly and testing of our transceiver sub-component based on our design and components, and Celestica is responsible for final assembly and testing of our LiDAR sensor including the transceiver from Fabrinet. In 2024, we announced our SOP for our lead customer at the dedicated manufacturing facility in Mexico, owned and operated by Celestica, and we began shipping production LiDAR sensors.\nIn 2023, we executed a contract manufacturing services agreement with TPK to build and operate a high volume facility in Asia, and we commenced the process of series production tooling in partnership with TPK at the facility. In 2024, we executed an agreement to establish an engineering center in China, staffed by TPK, to assist with our industrialization efforts, including manufacturing process design, development and validation, component process verification and validation, supplier development support, system validation, cost analysis, and benchmarking. This expanded partnership with TPK is accretive to our contract manufacturing relationship, as well as our contract manufacturing relationships with Celestica and Fabrinet.\nWe continually evaluate opportunities for optimizing our manufacturing and product design processes. In 2024, we commenced an effort to further streamline our sourcing strategy and improve per unit sensor manufacturing costs, including changing the sourcing and final assembly of certain components from one contract manufacturer to another. This effort included scaled down or production downtime at the dedicated manufacturing facility in Mexico.\nResearch and Development \nOur research and development activities occur in various locations in the United States, Germany, Sweden, China and India.\nOur research and development team is responsible for creating new technologies and expanding LiDAR and perception and mapping software functionality. The team is responsible for ensuring our LiDAR is designed for manufacturability and testability. The team partners with our operations and supply chain functions to develop scalable, commercial and reliable manufacturing processes and direct production material procurement. \nSales and Marketing \nWe use customer feedback to specifically tailor our product and approach to build and expand our relationships with potential commercial partners. In parallel, marketing and communications drive our brand equity and narrative through ongoing announcements, campaigns, events, speaking opportunities, and public relations efforts. \nThe automotive value chain characteristically involves research and feasibility studies, followed by long-term product development cycles, including testing and qualification with automakers which can last for several years. In general, automaker agreements do not guarantee potential volumes, or timing of purchases to their suppliers during product development cycle. Instead, typically, after initial research and feasibility agreements and extensive competitive negotiations, automakers enter into development agreements that establish collaborations or partnerships to develop and integrate technology into the automaker’s vehicles or platforms intended for series production, frequently accompanied by non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) projects. While these collaboration or partnership agreements provide automakers the right to terminate the relationship without purchasing any production volume, factors such as difficulty of integrating complex technologies, sunken costs relating to NRE projects, impact on product roadmaps, time to market, and risk of being unable to secure future supply may deter automakers to cancel collaboration or development agreements. Automakers typically only enter into blanket purchase orders or other definitive supply agreements with binding commitments several months before production is expected to begin.\nGovernment Regulation \nAutomotive safety regulation in the area of autonomy is split between two categories: (1) SAE Level 0-2 (including active safety, driver assist, and conditional autonomy); and (2) SAE Level 3-5 (partial through full autonomy, commonly referred to as “higher autonomy”). In general, throughout the world, there is a positive legal environment that encourages consumer sale and use of SAE Level 0-2 functionality. The legal environment for SAE Level 3-5 functionality varies, generally encouraging the safe testing and development of higher autonomy functions, but restricting consumer use in personal vehicles and commercial use, as in automated trucking and taxis in many regions.\nIn the U.S., at both the federal and state level, nearly all SAE Level 0-2 functionality is permitted, while SAE Level 3-5 enjoys a positive environment for on-road testing and development, but mixed opportunities to deploy in consumer and commercial use. Federal regulation does not prohibit higher levels of autonomy today, but if NHTSA deems an autonomy system unsafe, it would order a recall to remove vehicles from the road. Thus far, several U.S. states have expressly permitted SAE Level 4-5 levels of autonomy, while many remain silent, and others have laws that limit driverless operation. We believe regulations related to autonomous vehicle technologies will continue to evolve to remove hurdles as state and federal regulators gain more experience with the technology. \nTable of Contents\n\nIn Europe, China, and the rest of the world, most automotive safety is regulated by a common system under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE). Under current UN/ECE standards, SAE Level 0-2 functionality may be deployed with certain restrictions, such as road type and with driver monitoring, and certain SAE Level 3 systems, such as so-called “traffic jam assist” systems, may be introduced with speed limitations determined by the detection range, but higher SAE Level 4-5 functionality is limited to testing only or narrow exceptions. Safety regulators continue to work on standards for higher autonomy, but we expect this development process to be slow. However, China has increasingly departed from the common UN/ECE standards and is more likely to create its own regulations allowing higher levels of autonomy in the nearer term and has also developed regions and cities for higher levels of autonomy based on local regulation.\nGiven the intense work in these regulatory areas, there is a positive environment for deploying our LiDAR technology and Proactive SafetyTM today in SAE Level 0-2 systems. While there is risk that SAE Level 3-5 systems may be delayed by regulation in some countries, we expect a workable path forward over the next several years as a more permissive regulatory and political environment develops.\nEmployees \nAs of December 31, 2024, excluding contractors, we had 580 full-time employees primarily in the United States, Germany, Sweden, India and China. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.\nOur human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants, while aiming towards a talented and diverse workforce. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.\nMetrics Update\nIn the past, before we had commenced series production, we disclosed “Order Book” as an alternative metric to measure our commercial progress and the opportunity for our business. Order Book was defined as the forward-looking cumulative billings estimate of Luminar’s hardware and software products over the lifetime of given vehicle production programs for which our technology was expected to be integrated into or provided for, based primarily on projected or actual contractual pricing terms and our good faith estimates of volume. \nNow that we have achieved series production, our assessment is that Order Book is no longer as valuable a metric as sensors shipped. We have thus removed disclosure of an Order Book estimate in favor of disclosing sensors shipped, and associated guidance, as an alternative metric by which to measure our commercial, operational, and financial progress. This is a consistent practice with other LiDAR companies that have reached the series production stage. \nCorporate Social Responsibilities and Sustainability \nWe are committed to active and responsible corporate citizenship. Our Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) program is divided into seven elements (diversity and inclusion; human resources; finance/accounting; responsible sourcing; environmental, health and safety; trade compliance; and business ethics), each spearheaded by company leaders and subject matter experts in their respective areas. We expect ADAS and automated driving technologies to provide strong social benefits, such as reducing roadway injuries and fatalities, including in urban areas, making roadways more efficient by reducing commuting times and CO2 emissions, and offering improved productivity.\nAvailable Information\nThis Form 10-K, along with all other reports and amendments filed with or furnished to the SEC, are publicly available free of charge on our Investor Relations website at https://investors.luminartech.com/ or at www.sec.gov as soon as reasonably practicable after these materials are filed with or furnished to the SEC.

We incurred net losses of $273.1 million, $571.3 million and $445.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses each quarter until at least the time we begin high volume commercial deliveries of our LiDAR-based products, which may occur later than we anticipate or not at all. Even if we successfully develop and sell our LiDAR and software solutions, there can be no assurance that they will be commercially successful. Our potential profitability is dependent upon the successful development and successful commercial introduction and acceptance of our LiDAR solutions, which may not occur. \nWe expect the rate at which we will incur losses to be remain high in future periods as we: \n•expand our production capabilities to produce our LiDAR solutions, including costs associated with outsourcing the production of our LiDAR solutions;\n•continue to utilize our third-party partners for design, testing and commercialization;\n•expand our design, development, installation and servicing capabilities to address production of more products for more customers in more countries;\n•build up inventories of parts and components for our LiDAR solutions;\n•produce an inventory of our LiDAR solutions;\n•continue to invest in our software development; and\n•increase our sales and marketing activities and develop our distribution infrastructure. \nBecause we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive incremental revenues with respect thereto, our losses in future periods will be significant. In addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in revenues, which would further increase our losses. \nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. \nWe have been focused on developing LiDAR products for autonomous driving systems and driver assistance systems since 2012. This relatively limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks and challenges we have faced or expect to face include our ability to:\n•produce and deliver LiDAR and software products of acceptable performance, volume, cost, and quality; \n•forecast our revenue and budget for and manage our expenses; \n•attract new customers and retain existing customers in the automotive supply chain where sourcing and volume production targets are not guaranteed; \n•comply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;\n•plan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future products, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future products; \n•anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate; \n•maintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand; \n•effectively manage our growth and business operations; \n•develop and protect intellectual property; \n•hire, integrate, and retain talented people at all levels of its organization; and \n•successfully develop new solutions to enhance the experience of customers and consumers. \nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, \nTable of Contents\n\nany predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. \nWe continue to implement strategic initiatives designed to grow our business. These initiatives may prove more costly than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue in an amount sufficient to offset the costs of these initiatives and to achieve and maintain profitability. \nWe continue to make investments and implement initiatives designed to grow our business, including: \n•investing in R&D;\n•investing in new applications and markets for our products; \n•investing in our manufacturing processes and partnerships to scale production; \n•expanding our sales and marketing efforts to attract new customers; \n•protecting our intellectual property; \n•acquiring businesses of strategic importance; and \n•investing in legal, accounting, human resources, and other administrative functions necessary to support our operations as a public company. \nThese initiatives may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue, if at all, in an amount sufficient to offset these higher expenses and to achieve and maintain profitability. The market opportunities we are pursuing are at an early stage of development, and it may be many years before the end markets we expect to serve generate demand for our products at scale. Our revenue may be adversely affected for a number of reasons, including:\n•the development and/or market acceptance of new technology that competes with our LiDAR products;\n•if certain automotive OEMs or other market participants change their autonomous vehicle and driver assistance technologies;\n•failure of our customers to commercialize autonomous systems that include our solutions, or delays thereof;\n•our ability to create, validate, and manufacture at high volume, as well as ship our products to customers;\n•our inability to effectively manage our inventory or manufacture our products at scale;\n•our inability to enter new markets or help our customers adapt our products for new applications; \n•our failure to attract new customers or expand orders from existing customers; or \n•increasing competition from other LiDAR companies.\nFurthermore, it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our target markets, customer demand for our products, commercialization timelines, developments in autonomous vehicle sensing and related technology, the entry of competitive products, or the success of existing competitive products and services. For these reasons, we do not expect to achieve profitability over the near term. If our revenue does not grow over the long-term, our ability to achieve and maintain profitability may be adversely affected, and the value of our business may significantly decline. \nIf our LiDAR products are not selected for inclusion in ADAS or autonomous driving systems by more automotive OEMs or their suppliers, our business will be materially and adversely affected. \nAutomotive OEMs and their suppliers design and develop ADAS and autonomous driving technology over several years. These automotive OEMs and suppliers undertake extensive testing and qualification processes prior to placing orders for large quantities of products such as our LiDAR, because such products will function as part of a larger system or platform over the duration of program life, and often must meet certain other specifications. We spend significant time and resources to have our products selected by automotive OEMs and their suppliers. We define the term “major win” or “major commercial win” to have occurred when (a) we have obtained a written agreement (e.g. non-binding expression of interest arrangement or an agreement for non-recurring engineering project) or public announcement with a major industry player, and (b) based on past experience in high volume production, leadership in autonomy, or market leadership of said major industry player, we expect to ultimately be awarded a significant commercial program, including an OEM series production program. If we do not achieve a major commercial win with respect to a particular vehicle model, we may not have an opportunity to supply our products to the \nTable of Contents\n\nautomotive OEM for that vehicle model for a period of many years. In many cases, this period can be as long as seven or more years. If our products are not selected by an automotive OEM or its suppliers for one vehicle model or if our products are not successful in that vehicle model, it is unlikely that our product will be deployed in other vehicle models of that OEM. If we fail to win a significant number of vehicle models from one or more automotive OEMs or their suppliers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. For more information about certain risks related to product selection, see the risk factor captioned “The period of time from a major commercial win to implementation is long, and we are subject to risks of cancellation or postponement of the contract or unsuccessful implementation.”\nThe period of time from a major commercial win to implementation is long, and we are subject to risks of cancellation or postponement of the contract or unsuccessful implementation. \nProspective customers, including those in the automotive industry, generally must make significant commitments of resources to test and validate our products and confirm that they can integrate with other technologies before including them in any particular system, product, or model. While certain customers have executed a non-binding expression of interest arrangement or engaged us for non-recurring engineering projects while they are evaluating our products, none of our customers make contractual commitments to use our LiDAR sensors or software until all test and validation activities have been completed, they have finalized plans for integrating our systems, have a positive expectation of the market demand for our features, and unrelated to us, have determined that their vehicle is ready for market and there is appropriate consumer demand. We expect that only after this point will our customers consider entering into definitive volume production agreements. \nThrough the end of 2024, we have entered into high volume series production with only one of our OEMs, and although we have certain purchase orders from others, none of our other automotive OEM customers have completed their on-going testing and validation with us. There is no assurance or guarantee that any of our other customers, including any for which we have announced a “major win” or “major commercial win”, will ever complete such testing and validation or enter into a definitive volume production agreement with us or that we will receive any revenues forecasted in connection with such “major win” or “major commercial win”. \nThe development cycles of our products with new customers varies widely depending on the application, market, and customer, as well as the complexity of the product. In the automotive market, for example, this development cycle can be as long as seven or more years. The development cycle in certain other markets can be several months to a few years. These development cycles result in us investing our resources prior to realizing any revenue from commercialization or obtaining any firm commitments of pricing, volume or timing of purchases of our products by our customers. Further, we are subject to the risk that customers cancel or postpone implementation of our technology, or that we will not be able to integrate our technology successfully into a larger system with other sensing modalities. Additionally, our revenue could be materially less than forecasted estimates if the system, product, or vehicle model that includes our LiDAR is unsuccessful, including for reasons unrelated to our technology. Long development cycles and product cancellations or postponements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully fund our growth if there are considerable delays in product introductions by us or our customers. Thus, even if we have been successful in obtaining major commercial wins, long development cycles, product cancellations or postponements, and failures to successfully integrate our technology may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nOur forward-looking estimates of certain financial metrics may prove inaccurate. \nWe use various estimates in formulating our business plans. We base our estimates upon a number of assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business and economic uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. These estimates include our assessment of whether a “major win” or “major commercial win” has occurred, and previously included an estimate of “Order Book” as an alternative metric to measure our commercial progress and the opportunity for our business. Our estimates therefore may prove inaccurate, causing the actual amount to differ from our estimates. The factors which may cause actual amounts to differ from our estimates include, without limitation: \n•the extent to which customers who have selected Luminar for a major commercial win include our hardware and software products into their systems, products, or vehicle models, including the percentage or take rate within a vehicle configuration planned for production by our customers, which may change over time; \n•the extent to which Luminar meets contractual terms and conditions, and whether there are any series production delays, whether caused by Luminar or unrelated to our technology; \n•the extent to which our technology is successfully integrated into our customers’ products; \n•the timing of when our customers adopt our technology into their products on a commercial basis which could be delayed for regulatory, safety or reliability issues unrelated to our technology; \nTable of Contents\n\n•defects, errors, lack of reliability or other issues in our hardware or software which could reduce the market adoption of our products or delay or stop production; \n•loss of business with respect to, or the failure or lack of commercial success of, a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier for reasons unrelated to our technology; For more information about certain risks related to discontinuation or loss of business, see the risk factor captioned “The discontinuation or lack of commercial success of, or loss of business with respect to, a particular vehicle model or technology package for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and adversely affect our profitability;” \n•a decline, for any reason, in the production levels of our customers, particularly with respect to models which incorporate our technology;\n•customer cancellations of their contracts with us; \n•the extent to which end consumers select our products when purchasing a vehicle option package from automotive OEMs; and\n•other risk factors set forth in this Form 10-K.\nOur revenue estimate for 2024, projected cash position at year end 2024 and timing to achieve positive gross margin have differed from our actual results due to one or more factors mentioned above. If we fail to meet the financial estimates or targets we provide for 2025 and beyond, or if we find it necessary to revise such estimates or targets, the market value of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe discontinuation or lack of commercial success of, or loss of business with respect to, a particular vehicle model or technology package for which we are a significant supplier and the absence of demand from end automotive consumers for our features, could reduce our sales and adversely affect our profitability. \nIf we are able to secure major commercial wins and our solutions are included in ADAS and autonomous driving systems by automotive OEMs, we expect to enter into supply agreements with those relevant customers. Market practice dictates that these supply agreements typically require us to supply a customer’s requirements for a particular vehicle model ADAS or autonomous driving system, rather than supply a set number of products over a given period. These requirement contracts can have short terms and/or can be subject to renegotiation, sometimes as frequently as annually, all of which may affect product pricing, and these contracts may also be terminated by our customers at any time. Moreover, end automotive consumers must demand and be willing to pay for our features if our technology is not included as standard equipment on a vehicle program. Therefore, even if we are successful in obtaining major commercial wins and the systems into which our products are built are commercialized, the discontinuation of, the loss of business with respect to, or a lack of commercial success of a particular vehicle model or technology package for which we are a significant supplier, and the absence of demand from end automotive consumers for our features, could mean that the expected sales of our products will not materialize, which would materially and adversely affect our business. \nInformation concerning our future cost of goods sold (COGS) and bill of materials (BOM) estimates may prove inaccurate. \nWe periodically provide estimates of future cost of goods sold and bill of materials which by necessity, are projections based on anticipated rates of future production of our customers and the timing of related expenditures, and there are uncertainties inherent in the creation and interpretation of such data. \nPricing negotiated in our supply agreements for key components like receiver, ASIC and laser are dependent on volume estimates which may not be realized. Most of our components are manufactured using technologies that are highly complex and consequently, estimates of BOM and COGS may fluctuate due to many variable factors and assumptions, including but not limited to the following: \n•meeting certain volume estimates;\n•our reliance on key inputs and our ability to reduce and control the cost of such inputs. For more information about certain risks related to our reliance on key inputs and our inability to reduce and control the costs of such inputs, see the risk factor captioned “We are reliant on key inputs, and our ability to reduce and control the cost of such inputs could negatively impact the adoption of our products and our profitability;” \n•the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of key components and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products. For more information about certain risks related to reliance on third-party suppliers, see the risk factor captioned “We rely on third-party suppliers and because some of the raw materials and key components in our products come from limited or single source suppliers, we are susceptible to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain and could delay deliveries of our products to customers;” \nTable of Contents\n\n•consistency and adequate quality and quantity of piece parts, other raw materials, and other bill of materials items; \n•contract negotiations and the execution of firm supply agreements; \n•future versions of our product design incorporating new components meeting our customers’ requirements and specifications. For more information about certain risks related to product selection, see the risk factor captioned “The period of time from a major commercial win to implementation is long, and we are subject to risks of cancellation or postponement of the contract or unsuccessful implementation;” \n•the qualification of new versions of our key components. For more information about certain risks related to qualification, see the risk factor captioned “If our LiDAR products are not selected for inclusion in ADAS or autonomous driving systems by automotive OEMs or their suppliers, our business will be materially and adversely affected;” \n•defects in production processes (including system assembly) either within our facilities, at our contract manufacturers, or at our suppliers; \n•any transitions or changes in our production process, planned or unplanned; and \n•other risk factors set forth in this Form 10-K. \nWe are reliant on key inputs and our inability to reduce and control the cost of such inputs could negatively impact the adoption of our products and our profitability. \nThe production of our LiDAR sensors is dependent on producing or sourcing certain key components and raw materials at acceptable price levels. If we are unable to adequately reduce and control the costs of such key components, we will be unable to realize manufacturing cost targets, which could reduce the market adoption of our products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, and harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. \nContinued pricing pressures, automotive OEM cost reduction initiatives and the ability of automotive OEMs to re-source or cancel vehicle or technology programs may result in lower than anticipated margins, or higher than anticipated losses, which may adversely affect our business. \nCost-cutting initiatives adopted by many of our automotive customers often result in increased downward pressure on pricing for our products and competitive products. We expect that our agreements with automotive OEMs may require step-downs in pricing over the term of the agreement or, if commercialized, over the period of production. In addition, our automotive OEM customers often reserve the right to terminate their supply contracts for convenience, which enhances their ability to obtain price reductions. Automotive OEMs also possess significant leverage over their suppliers, including us, because the automotive component supply industry is highly competitive, serves a limited number of customers and has a high fixed cost base. \nAccordingly, we expect to be subject to continuing and substantial pressure from automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers to reduce the price of our products. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as automotive OEMs pursue restructuring, consolidation, and cost-cutting initiatives. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions, our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected. \nWe expect to incur substantial R&D costs and devote significant resources to identifying and commercializing new products, which could significantly reduce our profitability and may never result in revenue to us. \nOur future growth depends on penetrating new markets, adapting existing products to new applications and customer requirements, and introducing new products that achieve market acceptance. We plan to incur substantial, and potentially increasing, R&D costs as part of our efforts to design, develop, manufacture and commercialize new products and enhance existing products. Our R&D expenses were $231.7 million, $262.2 million and $185.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are likely to grow in the future. Because we account for R&D as an operating expense, these expenditures will adversely affect our results of operations in the future. Further, our R&D program, including our software development efforts, may not produce successful results, and our new products may not achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue or become profitable. \nMarket adoption of LiDAR is uncertain. Developments in alternative technology may adversely affect the demand for our LiDAR technology. If market adoption of LiDAR does not continue to develop, or develops more slowly than we expect, or our investments in educating our customers about the advantages of LiDAR fail, our business will be adversely affected. \nWhile our LiDAR-based ADAS and autonomous driving solutions can be applied to different use cases across end markets, the majority of our revenue is generated from automotive applications. Despite the fact that the automotive industry has engaged in considerable effort to research and test LiDAR products for ADAS and autonomous driving applications, the automotive industry may not introduce LiDAR products in commercially available vehicles. We continually study emerging \nTable of Contents\n\nand competing sensing technologies and methodologies and we may add new sensing technologies over time. However, LiDAR products remain relatively new to our targeted industries, and it is possible that other sensing modalities, or a new disruptive modality based on new or existing technologies, including a combination of technology, will achieve acceptance or leadership in the ADAS and autonomous driving space. For example, significant developments in alternative technologies, such as cameras and radar, may materially and adversely affect our business in ways we do not currently anticipate. Existing and other camera and radar technologies may emerge as customers’ preferred alternatives to our solutions. Any failure by us and our R&D efforts to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced products in the ADAS and autonomous driving industry, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our LiDAR solutions, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors. We plan to upgrade or adapt our LiDAR solutions with the latest technologies; however, our solutions may not compete effectively with alternative systems if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our existing LiDAR solutions.\nEven if LiDAR products are used in initial generations of autonomous driving technology and certain ADAS products, we cannot guarantee that LiDAR products will be designed into or included in subsequent generations of such commercialized programs. Many automakers are now concentrating on improving consumer vehicle ADAS technology and creating new conditional automation systems; however, as these products and features are newly emerging, consumer acceptance and pricing desirability remains uncertain, and automakers may discontinue or decrease use in favor of cheaper vehicles without these technologies or systems, particularly if government regulations and safety ratings do not support ADAS technology. In addition, we expect that initial generations of fully autonomous vehicles will be focused on limited applications, such as robo-taxis, and that mass market adoption of autonomous technology may lag behind these initial applications significantly. The speed of market growth for ADAS or autonomous vehicles is difficult, if not impossible, to predict, and it is more difficult to predict this market’s future growth in light of geopolitical instability, rapid inflation, and potential recession. Educating customers about LiDAR, its advantages over other sensing technologies, and LiDAR’s ability to convey value in different industries and deployments is also an integral part of developing new business and the LiDAR market generally. If customers have a negative perception of, or experience with, our LiDAR or a competitor’s LiDAR products, they may be reluctant to adopt LiDAR in general or specifically our products. Our investments and efforts to educate potential customers and the market generally and to counter any adverse statements made by competitors or other market participants thus, may not be successful.\nAlthough we currently believe we are a leader in LiDAR-based systems for our targeted markets, by the time mass market adoption of ADAS and autonomous driving technology is achieved, we expect competition among providers of sensing technology based on LiDAR and other sensors modalities to increase substantially. If commercialization of LiDAR products is not successful, or not as successful as we or the market expects, or if other sensing modalities gain acceptance by developers of ADAS or autonomous driving systems, automotive OEMs, regulators and safety organizations, or other market participants by the time autonomous vehicle technology achieves mass market adoption, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. \nIn addition to automotive markets, we are investing in and pursuing market opportunities in other markets, including but not limited to last mile delivery, aerospace and defense, robotics, and security. We believe that our future revenue growth, if any, will depend in part on our ability to expand within new markets such as these and to enter new markets as they emerge. Each of these markets presents distinct risks and, in many cases, requires us to address the particular requirements of that market. \nAddressing the unique requirements of adjacent markets can be time-consuming and costly. The market for LiDAR technology outside of automotive applications is relatively new, rapidly developing, and unproven in many markets or industries. Many of our customers outside of the automotive industry remain in the testing and development phases; and we cannot be certain that they will commercialize products or systems with our LiDAR products or at all. Additionally, we cannot be certain that LiDAR will be sold into these markets, or any market outside of the automotive market, at scale.\nAdoption of LiDAR, including our products, outside of the automotive industry will depend on numerous factors, including: whether the technological capabilities of LiDAR and LiDAR-based products meet customers’ current or anticipated needs; whether the benefits of designing LiDAR into larger sensing systems outweigh the costs, complexity and time needed to deploy such technology or replace or modify existing systems that may have used other modalities like cameras and radar; whether customers in other applications can move beyond the testing and development phases and proceed to commercializing systems supported by LiDAR technology; and whether LiDAR developers such as us can keep pace with rapid technological change in certain developing markets, and changes in the global economy or automotive industry caused by international relations. If LiDAR technology does not achieve commercial success outside of the automotive industry, or if the market develops at a pace slower than we expect, our business, results of operation, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. \nTable of Contents\n\nWe may experience difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations. \nWe expect to experience significant growth in the scope and nature of our operations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls, compliance programs, and reporting systems. We are currently in the process of strengthening our compliance programs, including our compliance programs related to export controls, privacy, cybersecurity and anti-corruption. We may not be able to implement improvements in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing controls, programs, systems, and procedures, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results. \nWe rely on third-party suppliers, and because some of the raw materials and key components in our products come from limited or single source suppliers, we are susceptible to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain and could delay deliveries of our products to customers. \nSome of the components that go into the manufacturing of our products are sourced from third-party suppliers. To date, we have manufactured our products in relatively limited quantities for use primarily in R&D programs. Although we do not have any experience in managing our supply chain to manufacture and deliver our products at scale, our future success will depend on our ability to manage our supply chain to manufacture and deliver our products at scale. Some of the key components used to manufacture our products come from limited or single source suppliers. We are therefore subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify components used in its products. We have a global supply chain, and health epidemics and outbreaks, geopolitical events, and government trade restrictions may adversely affect our ability to source components in a timely or cost effective manner from our third-party suppliers due to, among other things, work stoppages or interruptions. \nIncreasing international tensions related to national security matters between China and the U.S. and its allies, as well as increasing tariffs or export or import restrictions, including those contemplated by the new administration also could disrupt our supply chain. For example, our products depend on specific laser technology, and we currently consume a substantial portion of the available market. Any shortage of these lasers could materially and adversely affect our ability to manufacture our solutions. Additionally, China has imposed export bans to the U.S. on rare earth minerals; and while InGaAs, which is used in our critical photodiode technology, is considered a compound semiconductor not subject to export bans, the standalone elements indium and gallium are classified as rare earth metals, which introduces risk should such export bans be expanded.\nThe lead times associated with certain components in our products are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, component shortages and price fluctuations of certain key components and materials, and the predictability of the availability and pricing of these components may be limited. Component shortages or pricing fluctuations could be material in the future. In the event of a component shortage, supply interruption, or material pricing change from suppliers of these components, we may not be able to develop alternate sources in a timely manner, or at all in the case of sole or limited sources. Developing alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming, difficult, and costly, and we may not be able to source these components on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may undermine our ability to meet our requirements or to fill customer orders in a timely manner. Any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these parts or components, or the inability to obtain these parts or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, would adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our customers. This could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and channel partners, and delays in shipment of our products could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, increased component costs could result in lower gross margins. Even where we are able to pass increased component costs along to our customers, there may be a lapse of time before we are able to do so, such that we must absorb the increased cost. If we are unable to buy these components in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements on a timely basis, we will not be able to deliver products to our customers, which may result in such customers using competitive products instead of ours. \nBecause our product sales still include a significant amount of sales to customers for R&D projects and our orders are project-based, we expect our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline. \nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly in the future. As such, historical comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. The nature of our sales, which despite our start of series production for certain customers, still include a significant amount of sales to customers for R&D projects and project-based orders, sales in any given quarter can fluctuate based on the timing and success of our customers’ development projects. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. These fluctuations could adversely affect our ability to meet our expectations or those of securities analysts, ratings agencies, or investors. If we do not meet these expectations for any period, \nTable of Contents\n\nthe value of our business and our securities could decline significantly. Factors that may cause these quarterly fluctuations include, without limitation, those listed below: \n•the timing and magnitude of orders and shipments of our products in any quarter; \n•pricing changes we may adopt to drive market adoption or in response to competitive pressures; \n•our ability to retain our existing customers and attract new customers; \n•our ability to develop, introduce, manufacture, and ship in a timely manner products that meet customer requirements; \n•disruptions in our sales channels or termination of our relationships with important channel partners; \n•delays in customers’ purchasing cycles or deferments of customers’ purchases in anticipation of new products or updates from us or our competitors; \n•fluctuations in demand pressures for our products; \n•the mix of products sold in any quarter; \n•the impact of health epidemics and outbreaks, and the time it takes for economic recovery; \n•the timing and rate of broader market adoption of ADAS and autonomous driving systems utilizing our solutions across the automotive and other markets; \n•market acceptance of LiDAR and further technological advancements by our competitors and other market participants; \n•the ability of our customers to commercialize systems that incorporate our products; \n•any change in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including consolidation of competitors, regulatory developments, and new market entrants; \n•our ability to effectively manage our inventory; \n•changes in the source, cost, availability of, and regulations pertaining to materials we use, including the effect of inflation on the cost of components for our products;\n•adverse litigation, judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs, or claims that may give rise to such costs; \n•deterioration of international relations and trade disputes, especially related to China, changes in trade policy in the United States and other countries, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, which could disrupt the global automotive industry or LiDAR products specifically; and \n•general economic, industry and market conditions. \nOur transition to an outsourced manufacturing business model may not be successful, which could harm our ability to deliver products and recognize revenue.\nWe are in the process of transitioning from a manufacturing model in which we primarily manufactured and assembled our products in low volumes at our pilot facility in Orlando, Florida, to one where we rely on third-party contract manufacturers (“CMs”) in Mexico, Thailand, China and potentially other foreign and domestic locations. We believe the use of CMs will have benefits, such as lower manufacturing costs, but in the near term, while we are beginning manufacturing with such CMs, we may lose revenue, incur increased costs, and potentially harm our customer relationships. \nFor example, in evaluating opportunities for optimizing our manufacturing and product design processes during 2023 and 2024, we commenced efforts to streamline our sourcing strategy and improve per unit sensor manufacturing costs, which included changing the sourcing of final assembly and components from one contract manufacturer to another. This effort included production downtime at the dedicated manufacturing facility in Mexico. As a result, we also reduced the useful lives of the long-lived assets within the impacted asset group in line with when these assets are expected to be abandoned. The reduction in the estimated useful lives of the impacted assets resulted in us recording $4.4 million of accelerated depreciation charges in the year ended December 31, 2024. Our continuing optimization of our manufacturing and product design processes may impact estimated useful lives or carrying values of additional property, plant and equipment or other assets. Therefore, we could record additional depreciation, write-offs or other related costs. We may in the future implement other restructuring activities, which may include actions like reduction in workforce or changes in use of certain properties and other assets. Significant judgment is required to estimate restructuring costs; and these estimates, and the assumptions underlying them, may change as additional information becomes available or facts or circumstances related to restructuring initiatives change.\nTable of Contents\n\nReliance on third-party manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process, including our ability to finalize changes through validation, and reduces our control over product quality, product costs and product supply and timing. We may experience delays in shipments or issues concerning product quality from our third-party manufacturers. If any of our third-party manufacturers experience interruptions, delays or disruptions in supplying our products, including due to natural disasters, global health epidemics and outbreaks, geopolitical events, national security, trade restrictions on imports and exports, or work stoppages or capacity constraints, our ability to ship products to distributors and customers would be delayed. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could result in financial distress among third-party manufacturers upon which we rely, including those caused by tax or tariff changes, thereby increasing the risk of disruption of supplies necessary to fulfill our production requirements and meet customer demands. Additionally, if any of our third-party manufacturers experience quality control problems in their manufacturing operations and our products do not meet customer or regulatory requirements, we could be required to cover the cost of repair or replacement of any defective products. These delays or product quality issues could have an immediate and material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill orders and could have a negative effect on our operating results. In addition, such delays or issues with product quality could adversely affect our reputation and our relationship with our channel partners. If our third-party manufacturers experience financial, operational, manufacturing, or other difficulties, including restrictions that may be imposed by governments in response to tariffs or other actions taken by the U.S. government, or experience shortages in required components, or if they are otherwise unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture our products in required volumes or at all, our supply may be disrupted, we may be required to seek alternate manufacturers, and we may be required to re-design our products. It would be time-consuming, and could be costly and impracticable, to begin to use new designs, suppliers, and manufacturers, and such changes could cause significant interruptions in our supply to and could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries for our customers, and may subsequently lead to the loss of sales. While we take measures to protect our trade secrets, the use of third-party manufacturers may also risk disclosure of our innovative and proprietary manufacturing methodologies, which could adversely affect our business. \nOur sales and operations in international markets, including our manufacturing operations, expose us to operational, financial and regulatory risks. \nSales to international customers accounted for 5%, 8% and 14% of our revenue in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We are committed to growing our international sales. While we have committed resources, and are working closely with OEMs and other collaborators outside the U.S., to expand our international operations and sales channels, these efforts may not be successful. We have also commenced international manufacturing operations. International operations, including any manufacturing operations, are subject to a number of other risks, including: \n•foreign currency and exchange rate fluctuations;\n•local economic conditions; \n•geopolitical, political, and economic instability, wars and military conflicts, international terrorism and anti-American sentiment, particularly in emerging markets; \n•health epidemics and outbreaks; \n•potential for violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as those related to bribery and fraud; \n•tariffs, other trade barriers and restrictions, and preference for locally branded products, and laws and business practices favoring local competition; \n•increased difficulty in managing inventory;\n•difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities;\n•less effective protection of intellectual property; \n•foreign government regulatory requirements and stringent regulation of motor vehicles, ADAS and autonomous driving systems or products using our products and stringent consumer protection and product compliance regulations, including but not limited to UN/ECE vehicle regulations, General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, European competition law, the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, and the European Ecodesign Directive, all of which are costly to comply with and may vary from country to country;\n•national security and international trade restrictions on our hardware and software such as restrictions on import or export, particularly as related to U.S.–China relations; \n•difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; \nTable of Contents\n\n•import and export laws and requirements, and the impact of recently imposed tariffs, specifically on China, by the U.S. government and countermeasures governments may take in response, which may disrupt our supply chain, increase our production costs, and reduce our competitiveness in the global market; \n•potentially adverse tax consequences and changes in local tax and customs duty laws or changes in the enforcement, application, or interpretation of such laws; and \n•U.S. and foreign government restrictions on certain sales and technology transfer to certain countries of concern, in particular potential U.S.–China trade restrictions relating to semiconductors, artificial intelligence autonomous systems, and cybersecurity. \nThe occurrence of any of these risks could negatively affect our international business or increase our costs and decrease our profit margins and consequently materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. \nWe, our outsourcing partners and our suppliers may rely on complex machinery for our production, which involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty in terms of operational performance and costs. \nWe, our outsourcing partners and our suppliers may rely on complex machinery for the production, assembly, and installation of our LiDAR products, which will involve a significant degree of uncertainty and risk in terms of operational performance and costs. Our production facilities and the facilities of our outsourcing partners and suppliers consist of large-scale machinery with high capital expense combining many components. These components may suffer unexpected malfunctions from time to time and will depend on repairs and spare parts to resume operations, which may not be available when needed. Unexpected malfunctions of these components may significantly affect the intended operational efficiency. Operational performance and costs can be difficult to predict and are often influenced by factors outside of our control, such as, but not limited to, scarcity of natural resources, environmental hazards and remediation, costs associated with decommissioning machines, labor disputes and strikes, difficulty or delays in obtaining governmental permits, damages or defects in electronic systems, industrial accidents, fires, seismic activity, and natural disasters. Should operational risks materialize, it may result in the personal injury to or death of workers, the loss of production equipment, damage to production facilities, monetary losses, delays and unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage, administrative fines, increased insurance costs, and potential legal liabilities, all which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results, or financial condition. \nAs part of growing our business, we may make acquisitions. If we fail to successfully select, execute, or integrate our acquisitions, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and our stock price could decline. \nFrom time to time, we may undertake acquisitions to add new products and technologies, acquire talent, gain new sales channels, or enter into new markets or sales territories. In addition to possible stockholder approval, we may need approvals and licenses from relevant government authorities for targeted acquisitions and to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased delay and costs, and may disrupt our business strategy if we fail to achieve appropriate approvals described above. Furthermore, acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets, businesses, key personnel, customers, vendors and suppliers require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our operations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect. Acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of significant goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets, as well as exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant.\nTo date, we have limited experience with acquisitions and the integration of acquired technology and personnel. Failure to successfully identify, complete, manage, and integrate acquisitions could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur relationship with Chinese customers and our proposed international expansion into Asia could expose us to substantial business, regulatory, political, financial and economic risks.\nIn 2023, we executed a manufacturing services agreement with TPK, a Taiwanese contract manufacturer, to build and operate and additional high-volume facility for us in Asia. Under this agreement TPK will manufacture our LiDARs at a factory in Asia and utilize certain components and raw materials from Asia. In 2024, we executed an agreement to establish an engineering center in China, staffed by TPK, to assist with our industrialization efforts, including manufacturing process design, development and validation, component process verification and validation, supplier development support, system validation, cost analysis, and benchmarking. This expanded partnership with TPK is accretive to our contract manufacturing relationship, as well as to our contract manufacturing relationships with Celestica and Fabrinet.\nTable of Contents\n\nAny failure in our ability to establish our presence in China, grow our relationships with the Chinese OEMs, serve our global OEMs in China and suppliers, successfully launch our products and maintain product quality, or to realize the anticipated benefits of our relationships could harm our brand, prospects, operating results, and financial condition, and have an adverse effect on our business. \nOur operations in China could also expose us to substantial risks associated with doing business in China, such as, risks and regulations related to taxation, inflation, manufacturing, environmental, privacy, anti-mapping, cybersecurity, foreign currency exchange rates, as well as political risks, intellectual property risks, tariffs, import and export restrictions, the labor market and property and financial regulations. Additionally, we would need to maintain compliance with the market’s rapidly changing regulations, including ongoing development of standards to define deployment requirements for higher levels of autonomy.\nOur ability to operate in China may also be adversely affected by changes in, or our failure to comply with, Chinese laws, regulations, and standards. As we hire personnel to maintain our operations in China, we are exposed to risks associated with any changes to the employment and labor laws in China, which could increase our operating costs in China. \nThere is also significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and China with respect to political risks, including but not limited to, trade policies, technology transfer restrictions in import and export, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. \nActions by the U.S. and China that may restrict the import, export or sale of, or reduce governmental support for, LiDARs and related components may result in reciprocal restrictions and escalation that could impair our ability to compete effectively and supply products to the inherently global automotive industry. The U.S. restriction on the export of certain AI chips and support in the CHIPS and Sciences Act for sponsoring domestic semiconductor development, U.S. restrictions on purchasing of certain Chinese LiDAR technology, Chinese restrictions on the export of certain Chinese LiDAR technology, and Chinese restriction of autonomous software development in China by foreign companies may lead to escalation on both sides that could impair our ability to operate our business successfully in both China and the U.S., as well as globally. See “Changes to trade policy, tariffs, and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations” below.\nDefects, errors, lack of reliability or other issues in hardware or software, could reduce the market adoption of our new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, expose us to product liability and other claims, and adversely affect our operating costs. \nOur products, including our hardware and in-development software, are highly technical and very complex and require high standards to manufacture and have in the past and will likely in the future experience defects, security vulnerabilities, or other errors or reliability issues at various stages of development. We may be unable to in a timely manner release new products, manufacture existing products, correct problems that have arisen, or correct such problems to our customers’ satisfaction. Additionally, errors, defects, security vulnerabilities, or other issues with our products, especially as new products are introduced or as new versions are released, could result in injury, which may be serious, to the end users of technology incorporating our products, or those in the surrounding area. Other consequences could include our customers never being able to commercialize technology incorporating our products, litigation against us, negative publicity, and other consequences. These risks are particularly prevalent in the highly competitive ADAS and autonomous driving technology markets. Some errors or defects in our products may only be discovered after they have been tested, commercialized, and deployed by customers. If an accident involving a vehicle using our technology were to occur and result in injuries or purported injuries or death, we may incur significant costs from product recalls and repair or replacement requirements, as well as lawsuits, including class actions, for product liability or other claims against us by our customers and end users, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources. Our reputation or brand may also be damaged as a result of these problems, and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers, and could adversely affect our financial results. \nWe could also face claims for breach of contract, fraud, tort, breach of warranty or product defects as a result of these problems, and our business liability insurance coverage could prove inadequate with respect to a claim, and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn addition, if lawmakers or governmental agencies were to determine that the use of our products or certain ADAS or autonomous driving applications increased the risk of injury to all or a subset of end users, they may pass laws or adopt regulations that limit the use of our products, that increase our liability associated with the use of our products, or that regulate the use of or delay the deployment of ADAS and autonomous driving technology. Any of these events could adversely affect our brand, relationships with customers, operating results, or financial condition.\nTable of Contents\n\nWe may be subject to product liability or warranty claims that could result in significant direct or indirect costs, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. \nWe typically provide a limited-time warranty on our products. The occurrence of any material defects in our products could make us liable for damages and warranty claims. In addition, we could incur significant costs to correct any defects, warranty claims, or other problems, including costs related to product recalls. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality of our products could affect our brand image, partner and customer demand, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Also, warranty, recall, and product liability claims may result in litigation, including class actions, the occurrence of which could be costly, lengthy, and distracting and adversely affect our business and operating results. \nIf we do not maintain sufficient inventory or if we do not adequately manage our inventory, we could lose sales or incur higher inventory-related expenses, which could negatively affect our operating results. \nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and expenses, place orders sufficiently in advance with our suppliers and manufacturing partners, and manufacture products based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Fluctuations in the adoption of LiDAR products may affect our ability to forecast our future operating results, including revenue, gross margins, cash flows, and profitability. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including the rapidly changing nature of the ADAS and autonomous driving markets in which we operate, the uncertainty surrounding the market acceptance and commercialization of LiDAR technology, the emergence of new markets, an increase or decrease in customer demand for our products or for products and services of our competitors, product introductions by competitors, health epidemics and outbreaks, changing global demand as a result of geopolitical tension or wars, and any associated work stoppages or interruptions, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and the weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions. \nIf our LiDAR products are commercialized in ADAS and autonomous driving applications, both of which are experiencing rapid growth in demand, we may face challenges acquiring adequate supplies to manufacture our products and/or we and our manufacturing partners may not be able to manufacture our products at a rate necessary to satisfy the levels of demand, which would negatively affect our revenue and operating results, and could result in damage to our brand and customer relationships. This risk may be exacerbated by the fact that we may not carry or be able to obtain for our manufacturers a significant amount of inventory to satisfy short-term demand increases. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products available for sale. \nInventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would adversely affect our financial results, including our gross margin, and have a negative effect on our brand. \nThe average selling prices of our products could decrease rapidly over the life of the product, which may negatively affect our revenue and gross margin. \nWe may experience declines in the average selling prices of our products generally as our customers seek to commercialize ADAS and autonomous driving systems at prices low enough to achieve market acceptance. In order to sell products that have a declining average selling price per unit and maintain margins at the same time, we will need to continually reduce product and manufacturing costs. To manage manufacturing costs, we must engineer the most cost-effective design for our products. We must also continuously drive initiatives to reduce labor cost, improve worker efficiency, reduce the cost of materials, use fewer materials, and further lower overall product costs by carefully managing component prices, inventory and shipping cost. We also need to continually introduce new products with higher selling prices and gross margin in order to maintain our overall gross margin. If we are unable to manage the cost of older products or successfully introduce new products with higher gross margin, our revenue and overall gross margin would likely decline. \nAdverse conditions in the automotive industry or the global economy more generally could have adverse effects on our results of operations. \nWhile we make our strategic planning decisions based on the assumption that the markets we are targeting will grow, our business is dependent, in large part on, and directly affected by, business cycles and other factors affecting the global automotive industry and global economy generally. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including consumer spending and preferences, changes in interest rates and credit availability, consumer confidence, fuel costs, fuel availability, environmental impact, governmental incentives, regulatory requirements, and political volatility, especially in energy-producing countries and growth markets. In addition, automotive production and sales can be affected by our automotive OEM customers’ ability to continue operating in response to challenging economic conditions and in response to labor relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements and other factors, such as geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions on the supply of semiconductors or LiDARs for vehicles. The volume of automotive production in North America, Europe and the rest of the world has fluctuated, sometimes significantly, from year to year, and we expect such fluctuations to give rise to fluctuations in the demand for our products. Any significant \nTable of Contents\n\nadverse change in any of these factors may result in a reduction in automotive production and sales by our OEM customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nBecause LiDAR is new and since many of the markets in which we compete are new and rapidly evolving, it is difficult to forecast long-term end-customer adoption rates and demand for our products. \nWe are pursuing opportunities in markets that are undergoing rapid changes, including technological and regulatory changes, and it is difficult to predict the timing and size of our market opportunities. For example, LiDAR-based ADAS and autonomous driving applications require complex technology. Because these automotive systems depend on technology from many companies, commercialization of ADAS or autonomous driving systems could be delayed or impaired on account of certain technological components of ours or others not being ready to be deployed in vehicles. Although we currently are engaged with multiple commercial customers, these companies may not be able to commercialize our technology immediately, or at all. Regulatory, safety, or reliability developments, many of which are outside of our control, could also cause delays or otherwise impair commercial adoption of these new technologies, including whether government policy, regulation, consumer education, and ratings programs support autonomous technology or improved driver assistance systems. \nOur future financial performance will depend on our ability to make timely investments in the correct market opportunities and to anticipate potential technological changes. If one or more of these markets experience a shift in existing customer or prospective customer demand, our products may not compete as effectively, if at all, and they may not be designed into commercialized products. Given the evolving nature of the markets in which we operate, it is difficult to predict customer demand or adoption rates for our products or the future growth of the markets in which we operate. As a result, any financial projections in this Form 10-K, and any market opportunity estimates and forecasts of market growth, necessarily reflect various estimates and assumptions that may not prove accurate and these projections could differ materially from actual results due to the risks included in this “Risk Factors” section, among others. If demand does not develop or if we cannot accurately forecast customer demand, the size of our markets, inventory requirements, our future financial results, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be adversely affected. Even if markets experience growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all, since our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties set forth in this Form 10-K. Accordingly, any forecasts and estimates of market size and growth should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nWe currently have and target customers that are large corporations with substantial negotiating power, exacting product standards, and potentially competitive internal solutions. If we are unable to sell our products to these customers, our prospects and results of operations will be adversely affected. \nMany of our customers and potential customers are large, multinational corporations with substantial negotiating power relative to us, and, in some instances, may have internal solutions that are competitive to our products. These large, multinational corporations also have significant development resources, which may allow them to acquire or develop independently, or in partnership with others, competitive technologies. Meeting the technical requirements and securing major commercial wins with any of these companies will require a substantial investment of our time and resources. We cannot assure that our products will secure major commercial wins from these or other companies or that we will generate meaningful revenue from the sales of our products to these key potential customers. If our products are not selected by these large corporations or if these corporations develop or acquire competitive technology, it will have an adverse effect on our business. \nWe are substantially dependent on our partnership with a few key customers, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if our partnership with any of such customers were terminated. Our financial position and results could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to collect our invoices for any of our key customers. \nWe are dependent on a collection of large customers with strong purchasing power. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, our top 10 customers represented 70%, 66% and 69% of our revenue, respectively. In 2024, Scale.AI, in 2023, Daimler and Scale.AI, and in 2022, Daimler and Scale.AI each accounted for more than 10% of our annual revenue. The loss of business from any of our major customers (whether by lower overall demand for our products, cancellation of existing contracts or product orders, or the failure to design in our products or award us new business) could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nTo the extent ADAS and autonomous driving systems become widely accepted by major automotive OEMs, we expect that we will increasingly rely for our revenue on Tier 1 suppliers through which automotive OEMs often procure components. We expect that these Tier 1 suppliers will be responsible for certain hardware and software configuration activities specific to each OEM, and they may not exclusively carry our solutions. \nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our relationship with any of our key customers and secure orders for our products. If we are unable to maintain our relationship any of our key customers, or if our arrangement is modified so that the economic terms become less favorable to us, then our business, financial results, and position would be materially adversely affected. There is also a risk that one or more of our major customers could be unable to pay our invoices as they become due or that a customer will simply refuse to make such payments if it experiences financial difficulties. If a \nTable of Contents\n\nmajor customer were to enter into bankruptcy proceedings or similar proceedings, whereby contractual commitments are subject to stay of execution and the possibility of legal or other modification, we could be forced to record a substantial loss. \nIf we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among customers within our industry and among securities analysts or investors, or are subject to negative publicity, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and access to capital may suffer materially. \nCustomers may be less likely to purchase our LiDAR solutions if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service, support, and other operations will continue in the long term. \nSimilarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, ratings agencies, securities analysts and investors, and other parties in our products, business prospects, and long-term financial viability. Maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors, including those that are largely outside of our control, such as our limited operating history, customer unfamiliarity with our LiDAR solutions, any delays in scaling production, delivery, and service operations to meet demand, competition and uncertainty regarding the future of ADAS and autonomous driving technology, or uncertainty around our other services, as well as our production and sales performance compared with market expectations. \nWe operate in a highly competitive market and some market participants have substantially greater resources. We compete against a large number of both established competitors and new market entrants. \nThe markets for sensing technology applicable to ADAS and autonomous solutions in the automotive industry are highly competitive. Our future success will depend on our ability to remain a leader in our targeted markets by continuing to develop, and protect from infringement advanced LiDAR technology in a timely manner and to stay ahead of existing and new competitors. Our competitors are numerous, and they compete with us directly by offering LiDAR products and indirectly by attempting to solve some of the same challenges with different technology. We face competition from camera and radar companies, other developers of LiDAR products, Tier 1 suppliers, and other technology and automotive supply companies, some of which have significantly greater resources than we do. \nIn the automotive market, our competitors and customers have commercialized both LiDAR and non-LiDAR-based ADAS technology that has achieved market adoption, strong brand recognition, and may continue to improve. Other competitors and customers are working towards commercializing autonomous driving technology, and either by themselves, or with a publicly announced partner, have substantial financial, marketing, R&D and other resources. Some of our customers in the ADAS and autonomous driving markets have announced development efforts or made acquisitions directed at creating their own LiDAR-based or other sensing technologies, which would compete with our solutions. We do not know how close these competitors are to commercializing new ADAS applications or autonomous driving systems. In markets outside of the automotive industry, our competitors, like us, seek to develop new sensing applications across industries. Even in these emerging markets, we face substantial competition from numerous competitors seeking to prove the value of their technology. \nAdditionally, increased competition may result in pricing pressure and reduced margins, and may impede our ability to increase the sales of our products or cause us to lose market share, any of which will adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nIf we are unable to achieve technological feasibility and commercialize our software products, including our perception and decision-making software products, such as our Proactive Safety™ and highway autonomy features, develop other new solutions, and improve existing solutions in a cost-effective and timely manner, then our competitive position may be negatively impacted and our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, which requires us to continue to develop new products and product innovations and could adversely affect market adoption of our products.\nOur future success may depend upon our ability to develop our software products, including our perception and decision-making software products, such as our Proactive Safety™ and highway autonomy features, and our ability to introduce a variety of new capabilities, product offerings, and innovations to our existing product offerings, to address the changing needs of the markets in which we offer our products.\nWe are currently working on developing perception and decision-making software products, including our Proactive Safety™ and highway autonomy features as well as our Sentinel solution, all of which are important components of our business plan and which have not achieved ongoing technological feasibility as of the year ended December 31, 2024. We may encounter significant unexpected technical and production challenges, or delays in completing the development of these software products and other solutions, as well as ramping delivery of these solutions in a cost-efficient manner. We cannot guarantee that such software or other new products will be successfully developed, released in a timely manner, or at all, or \nTable of Contents\n\nachieve satisfactory performance or market acceptance. Any such failure could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, and cause our stock price to decline.\nDelays in delivering new products that meet customer requirements could damage our relationships with customers and lead them to seek alternative sources of supply, and we may not be able to achieve additional design wins with existing or new customers, or achieve broader market acceptance of our solutions. In addition, our success to date has been based on the delivery of our solutions to R&D programs in which developers are investing substantial capital to develop new systems. Our continued success relies on the success or continued progress of these R&D programs at these customers and ultimately transition from R&D phase into commercialized projects. As autonomous technology reaches the stage of large-scale commercialization, we will be required to develop and deliver solutions at price points that enable wider and ultimately mass-market adoption. Failure to achieve technological feasibility of our software products, delays in introducing products and innovations, the failure to choose correctly among technical alternatives, or the failure to offer innovative products or configurations at competitive prices may cause existing and potential customers to purchase our competitors’ products or turn to alternative sensing technologies. Lastly, no matter how successfully our software may or may not perform, customers may choose to purchase and incorporate software from more established automotive suppliers, technology companies, or alternatively develop software in-house.\nIf we are unable to devote adequate resources to develop products, or cannot otherwise successfully develop products or system configurations that meet customer requirements on a timely basis or that remain competitive with technological alternatives, our products could lose market share, our revenue could decline, we may experience operating losses, and our business and prospects would be adversely affected. \nWhile we intend to invest substantial resources to remain on the forefront of technological development, continuing technological changes in sensing technology, LiDAR, and the markets for these products, including the ADAS and autonomous driving industries, could adversely affect adoption of LiDAR and/or our products, either generally or for particular applications.\nIf we are unable to demonstrate the insurance benefits of LiDAR-based ADAS, develop and obtain regulatory approval to introduce a compelling insurance product, are unable to convey these cost-savings benefits to OEMs, their dealers, and consumers, our business may be negatively impacted. Because insurance rate plan benefits are not exclusive to us, other insurance companies may introduce similar savings plans; and while those will still benefit consumers and support the introduction of LiDARs in general, it may limit future success or longevity of our insurance product, which would negatively affect our business.\nOur future success in insurance depends heavily on the technological success of LiDAR-based ADAS to reduce rates of accidents and injuries, whether the software is introduced by us or OEM customers source software elsewhere. While we have demonstrated the benefits of our prototype software in test track testing regimes designed to correlate with real world crash and injury data, there is no guarantee that actual software in production vehicles will operate the same or that it will have the same actuarial result in the real world. We do not have a track record of building, selling, and servicing insurance products, and we may encounter unexpected difficulties, including barriers from regulators due to lack of experience. Even if we are successful in bringing a compelling insurance product to market, OEMs or their dealers who will likely be the point of sale to consumers may ultimately not be interested or unable to convey the benefits, and consumers may not be able to appreciate the cost savings benefits.\nWe had identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the past, which were remediated. However, if we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn connection with our financial statement close process for the year ended December 31, 2021, we had identified material weaknesses in the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses we identified resulted from a lack of a sufficient number of qualified personnel within our accounting and internal audit function who possessed an appropriate level of expertise to effectively perform functions relating to control environment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. In addition, these material weaknesses contributed to material weaknesses in information technology controls and journal entry review. These material weaknesses were remediated during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nA material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. These deficiencies could result in additional material misstatements to our consolidated financial statements that may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. \nAlthough we have remediated the material weaknesses, additional weaknesses in our internal controls may be discovered in the future. Any failure to further develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in our implementation \nTable of Contents\n\nor improvement, could adversely affect our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. If any of these were to occur, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, we could become subject to litigation or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. \nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $855.3 million of U.S. federal and $891.4 million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Of the $855.3 million in U.S. federal operating loss carryforwards, $812.1 million will be carried forward indefinitely for U.S. federal tax purposes. The federal net operating loss carryforwards, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2035. State net operating loss carryforwards, if not utilized, will begin to expire on various dates starting 2028. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration or at all. Under legislative changes made in December 2017, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such net operating losses is limited. In addition, the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section 383 of the U.S. Tax Code, respectively, and similar provisions of state law. Under those sections of the U.S. Tax Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or tax may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5 percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Austin Russell, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. \nWe are highly dependent on Austin Russell, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Russell created our first LiDAR product and he remains deeply involved in all aspects of our business, including product development. The loss of Mr. Russell would adversely affect our business because his loss could make it more difficult to, among other things, compete with other market participants, manage our R&D activities, and retain existing customers or cultivate new ones. Negative public perception of, or negative news related to, Mr. Russell may also adversely affect our brand, relationships with customers, or standing in the industry. \nOur business depends substantially on the efforts of our executive officers and highly skilled personnel, and our operations may be severely disrupted if we lost their services. \nCompetition for highly-skilled personnel is often intense, especially in Orlando, Florida and the San Francisco Bay Area, where two of our offices are located, and we may incur significant costs to attract highly-skilled personnel. We may not be successful in attracting, integrating, or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly-skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. Because we believe in an employee compensation philosophy based highly in equity to preserve capital and align employee interests with stockholders, a significant decrease in our stock price or the perceived value of our equity or equity awards may adversely affect our ability to retain highly-skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected and attracting and retaining talent using equity may be more expensive. As we continue the process of “return to the office” and decrease the amount of remote work after COVID-19, we may be unable to retain the talent of employees unwilling to return to the office.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics and outbreaks. \nWhile the impacts and risks related COVID-19 have significantly declined, any recurrence or new health epidemics or outbreaks could result in a material adverse impact on our or our customers’ business operations, including reduction or suspension of operations, disruption of supply chain, disruption of the global automotive business of our customers, or reduction in the global economy.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impact our ability to effectively provide our services. \nWe plan to include in-vehicle services and functionality that utilize data connectivity to monitor performance and timely capture opportunities to enhance performance and functionality. The availability and effectiveness of our services depend on the continued operation of information technology and communications systems. Our systems will be vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, physical theft, fire, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, power loss, war, telecommunications failures, viruses, denial or degradation of service attacks, ransomware, social engineering schemes, insider theft or misuse, or other attempts to harm our systems. We utilize reputable third-party service providers or vendors for all of our data other than our source code, and these providers could also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from actions or conditions similar to \nTable of Contents\n\nthose that could damage our systems, including sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism causing potential disruptions. Some of our systems will not be fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Any problems with our third-party cloud hosting providers could result in lengthy interruptions in our business. In addition, our in-vehicle services and functionality are highly technical and complex technology, which may contain errors or vulnerabilities that could result in interruptions in our business or the failure of our systems.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks to our and our suppliers’ operational systems, security systems, infrastructure, integrated software in our LiDAR solutions, and customer data processed by us or third-party vendors or suppliers and any material failure, weakness, interruption, cyber event, incident or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business.\nWe are at risk for interruptions, outages, and breaches of: operational and manufacturing systems, including business, financial, accounting, product development, data processing, or production processes, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; facility security systems, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; in-product technology owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; the integrated software in our LiDAR solutions; or customer or driver data that we process or our third-party vendors or suppliers process on our behalf. Such cyber incidents could materially disrupt operational systems and shipment of parts or products or result in a lockout of our operational systems; result in loss of intellectual property, trade secrets, or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise certain information of customers, employees, suppliers, drivers, or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; or affect the performance of in-product technology and the integrated software in our LiDAR solutions. A cyber incident could be caused by disasters, insiders (through inadvertence or with malicious intent), or malicious third parties (including nation-states or nation-state supported actors) using sophisticated, targeted methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses, including hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception. The techniques used by cyber attackers change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we maintain information technology measures designed to protect us against intellectual property theft, data breaches, and other cyber incidents, such measures will require updates and improvements, and we cannot guarantee that such measures will be adequate to detect, prevent, or mitigate cyber incidents. \nWe have implemented and continue to enhance our cybersecurity controls and systems. The implementation, maintenance, segregation, and improvement of these systems requires significant management time, personnel, support, and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving, expanding and updating current systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement, production, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies, or produce, sell, deliver and service our solutions, adequately protect our intellectual property, or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, applicable laws, regulations and contracts. We cannot be sure that the systems upon which we rely, including those of our third-party vendors or suppliers, will be effectively implemented, maintained, or expanded as planned. If we do not successfully implement, maintain, or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and in a timely manner report our financial results could be impaired, and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information or intellectual property could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions. \nA significant cyber incident could impact production capability, harm our reputation, cause us to breach our contracts with other parties or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, any of which could materially affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, our insurance coverage for cyber attacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of a cyber incident. \nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business \nWe are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. \nOur products and solutions are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. U.S. export control laws and regulations and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, and persons. In addition, complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and result in delay or loss of sales opportunities. Exports of our products and technology must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges, fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers, and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. \nTable of Contents\n\nChanges to trade policy, tariffs and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nGeopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to China, may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, export controls, import duties, and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies in the territories or countries where we currently purchase our components, sell our products, or conduct our business, as well as our government contracts and contracts with defense customers.\nThe increasing focus on the strategic national security importance of advanced semiconductors, autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that target LiDAR specifically, and products and services capable of enabling or facilitating autonomous vehicle systems or AI systems, including some or all of our components, product, and service offerings. Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to advanced semiconductors and AI technologies, including U.S. restrictions on export of advanced semiconductors to China, designation and restrictions on U.S. military purchases of LiDAR manufactured in China, China restriction on the collection and use of mapping data, which is an inhibitor to western companies developing autonomous vehicle software in China, and China’s export restrictions of certain highly specialized LiDARs intended for military use. As geopolitical tensions have increased, products associated with autonomous vehicles and AI, specifically including LiDAR, are increasingly the focus of national security and export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies, as well as China, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls may be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue, and financial results. Furthermore, disruption to worldwide semiconductor supply, including non-advanced semiconductors, has and may continue to affect production of vehicles. \nThe U.S. has recently instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include those related to the treatment of technologies or products similar to LiDAR, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. In addition, on February 1, 2025, President Trump announced the imposition of new tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, to take effect on February 4, 2025. On February 3, 2025, President Trump announced that the tariffs imposed on imports from Mexico and Canada would be paused for 30 days which went into effect on March 4, 2025; however, the new administration has paused tariffs on goods and services compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) until April 2, 2025. Given Luminar’s production of products in Mexico, tariffs of this nature would have specific impact on those products we bring into the United States. The impact of such tariffs on our business and financial condition, if any, is subject to a number of factors that are not yet known and may continue to change, including the duration of such tariffs, the scope and nature of any tariffs, the amount of any tariffs, any countermeasures that the target countries may take in response to such tariffs. \nIncreasing use of economic sanctions or new or higher tariffs may increase prices for vehicles and adversely impact demand for such vehicles, which may negatively impact demand for our products or services, and increase prices for parts imported into the United States which could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and financial results. Additional export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve international markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could also adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, such changes could adversely affect the automotive market, our ability to access key components or raw materials needed to manufacture our products (including, but not limited to, rare-earth metals), our ability to sell our products to customers outside the U.S. and the demand for our products. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations to adapt to or comply with any such changes, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nWe have in the past and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and consolidated financial position. \nWe may be, from time to time, involved in litigation, regulatory proceedings, and commercial or contractual disputes that may be significant. These matters may include, without limitation, disputes with our suppliers and customers, intellectual property claims, stockholder litigation, government investigations, class action lawsuits, personal injury claims, environmental issues, customs and value-added tax disputes, and employment and tax issues. In addition, we have in the past and could face in the future a variety of labor and employment claims against us, which could include but not limited to general discrimination, wage and hour, privacy, ERISA, or disability claims. In such matters, government agencies or private parties may seek to recover from us very large, indeterminate amounts in penalties or monetary damages (including, in some cases, treble or punitive damages) or seek to limit our operations in some way. These types of lawsuits could require significant management time and attention or could involve substantial legal liability, adverse regulatory outcomes, and/or substantial expenses to defend. Often these cases raise complex factual and legal issues and create risks and uncertainties. No assurances can be given \nTable of Contents\n\nthat any proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our operating results and consolidated financial position or that our established reserves or our available insurance will mitigate this impact.\nWe are subject to, and must remain in compliance with, numerous laws and governmental regulations concerning the manufacturing, use, distribution, and sale of our products. Some of our customers also require that we comply with their own unique requirements relating to these matters. \nWe primarily develop products for the automotive market, and the automotive industry is subject to specialized regulations in the U.S., Europe (UN/ECE), China, and other markets related to safety and the environment. These regulatory regimes are complex and change regularly, which may be a benefit or detriment. If we fail to adhere to these regulations or fail to continually monitor changes and adapt accordingly, we may be subject to litigation, loss of customers, or negative publicity and our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nIn 2024, the NHTSA in the U.S. published a Final Rule adopting new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 127 (“FMVSS 127”), which mandates advanced higher speed, no-contact AEB and PAEB systems on new cars and light trucks, with all vehicles being required to comply with these new requirements by 2029, although this Final Rule has been subject to a stay in implementation by the new administration and is also subject to litigation concerning the specifics of the rule. FMCSA had also introduced proposed rulemaking in 2023 with NHTSA to mandate AEB in heavy trucks. Depending on the outcome of the administration’s actions with respect to these rulemakings and the outcome of the litigation regarding FMVSS 127, such regulations and performance requirements they may promote the use of LiDAR-based safety systems, but if they fail to require the benefits that LiDAR-based safety brings, such regulations may impair our ability to introduce LiDAR in favor of weaker performing technologies.\nWe manufacture and sell products that contain electronic components, and such components may contain materials that are subject to government regulation in both the locations where we manufacture and assemble our products, as well as the locations where we sell our products. For example, certain laws or regulations limit the use of restricted materials or materials from certain regions, such as EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals and the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act, and those that relate to conflict minerals or forced labor. Since we operate on a global basis, this is a complex process, which requires continual monitoring of regulations and an ongoing compliance process to ensure that we and our suppliers are in compliance with existing regulations in each market where we operate. In addition, as a LiDAR technology company, we are subject to the Electronic Product Radiation Control Provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These requirements are enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Electronic product radiation includes laser technology. Regulations governing these products are intended to protect the public from hazardous or unnecessary exposure. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and reports to the FDA that their products comply with applicable performance standards, as well as maintain manufacturing, testing, and distribution records for their products. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, which could require us to cease distribution of our products, recall or remediate products already distributed to customers, or subject us to FDA enforcement. \nIf there is an unanticipated new regulation that significantly impacts our use and sourcing of various components or requires more expensive components, that regulation could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in building production facilities for our products. \nConcerns over environmental pollution and climate change have produced significant legislative and regulatory efforts on a global basis, and we believe this will continue both in scope and in the number of countries participating. In addition, as climate change issues become more prevalent, foreign, federal, state, and local governments, as well as our customers, have been responding to these issues. The increased focus on environmental sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements, or changes in current regulations and customer requirements, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about environmental impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward us or our products could be negatively impacted, and our business, results of operations, or financial condition could suffer. \nOur operations are and will be subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, and such laws and regulations could directly increase the cost of energy, which may have an effect on the way we manufacture products or utilize energy to produce our products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of raw materials or key components we use in our products. Environmental regulations require us to reduce product energy usage, monitor and exclude an expanding list of restricted substances, and participate in required recovery and recycling of our products. Environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we have limited experience complying with them. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third-party damages, suspension of production, or \nTable of Contents\n\na cessation of our operations. Contamination at properties we operate, we formerly operated, or to which hazardous substances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination, for impacts to human health, and for damages to natural resources. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. \nWe may face unexpected delays in obtaining the required permits and approvals in connection with our planned production facilities that could require significant time and financial resources and delay our ability to operate these facilities, which would adversely impact our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. \nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in regulations applicable to the automotive industry and laser market or concerns that drive further regulation of the automotive and laser markets.\nGovernment product safety regulations are an important factor for our business. Historically, these regulations have imposed increasingly stringent safety regulations and reporting requirements for vehicles and laser products. These safety regulations often require, or customers demand, that vehicles have more safety features per vehicle and more advanced safety products. \nWhile we believe increasing automotive and laser safety standards will present a market opportunity for our products, government safety regulations are subject to change based on a number of factors that are not within our control, including new scientific or technological data, adverse publicity regarding industry recalls, safety risks of ADAS and autonomous driving systems, accidents involving our products, domestic and foreign political developments or considerations, and litigation relating to our products and our competitors’ products. Changes in government regulations, especially in the ADAS and autonomous driving industries, could adversely affect our business. If government priorities shift and we are unable to adapt to changing regulations, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe FDA regulation of lasers limits the transmission power of 905nm lasers compared to 1550nm lasers to mitigate the risk of human eye damage. This causes one performance benefit for our 1550nm LiDAR compared with many of our competitors. Currently, there are research projects within certain trade groups intended to demonstrate that higher power transmission of 905nm lasers is possible without causing eye damage. Should these initiatives succeed and ultimately result in changed regulation, it could reduce or eliminate one competitive advantage of 1550nm LiDAR, adversely affecting our business. \nFederal and local regulators impose more stringent compliance and reporting requirements in response to product recalls and safety issues in the automotive and laser industries. As vehicles that carry our sensors go into production, the obligations of complying with safety regulations and reporting requirements could increase and it could require increased resources and adversely affect our business. \nIn addition, as vehicle regulators globally continue to consider new and enhanced emissions requirements, including electrification, to meet environmental and economic needs, as well as pursue new safety standards to address emerging traffic risks, OEMs may need to dedicate technology and cost additions to new vehicle designs to meet these emissions and safety requirements and, as a result, postpone the introduction of new ADAS and autonomous features due to cost pressures. \nFailures, or perceived failures, to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security requirements in the variety of jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely impact our business, and such legal requirements are evolving, uncertain, and may require improvements in, or changes to, our policies and operations. \nOur current and potential future operations and sales subject us to laws and regulations addressing privacy and the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, and protection of a variety of types of data. For example, the European Commission has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation and California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, both of which provide for potentially material penalties for non-compliance. These regimes may, among other things, impose data security requirements, disclosure requirements, and restrictions on data collection, uses, and sharing that may impact our operations and the development of our business. While we generally do not have access to, collect, store, process, or share information collected by our solutions unless our customers choose to proactively provide such information to us, our products may evolve to both address potential customer requirements or to add new features and functionality. Therefore, the full impact of these privacy regimes on our business is rapidly evolving across jurisdictions and remains uncertain at this time. \nWe may also be affected by cyber attacks and other means of gaining unauthorized access to our products, systems, and data. For instance, cyber criminals or insiders may target us or third parties with which we have business relationships to obtain data in a manner that disrupts our operations or compromises our products or the systems into which our products are integrated. \nTable of Contents\n\nWe are assessing the continually evolving privacy and data security regimes and measures we believe are appropriate in response. Since these data security regimes are evolving, uncertain, and complex, especially for a global business like ours, we may need to update or enhance our compliance measures as our products, markets, and customer demands further develop, and these updates or enhancements may require implementation costs. In addition, we may not be able to monitor and react to all developments in a timely manner. The compliance measures we do adopt may prove ineffective. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with current and future regulatory or customer-driven privacy, data protection, and information security requirements, or to prevent or mitigate security breaches, cyber attacks, or improper access to, use of, or disclosure of data, or any security issues or cyber attacks affecting us, could result in significant liability, costs (including the costs of mitigation and recovery), and a material loss of revenue resulting from the adverse impact on our reputation and brand, loss of proprietary information and data, disruption to our business and relationships, and diminished ability to retain or attract customers and business partners. Such events may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties, or adverse publicity, and could cause customers and business partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. \nRegulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. \nWe are subject to the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, specifically to determine, disclose and report whether our products contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of the materials used in the manufacturing of components used in our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures, to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used in or necessary to the production of our products, and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. It is also possible that our reputation may be adversely affected if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to alter our products, processes, or sources of supply to avoid use of such materials. \nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property \nDespite the actions we are taking to defend and protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or prevent unauthorized parties from copying or reverse engineering our solutions. Our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and prevent third parties from violating our rights may be costly. \nThe success of our products and our business depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights and maintain adequate legal protection for our products in the U.S. and other international jurisdictions. We rely on a combination of patent, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. \nWe cannot be assured that our currently-issued patents and trademarks and any patents and trademarks that may be issued or registered, as applicable, in the future with respect to pending or future applications will provide sufficiently broad protection or adequate defensive protection or competitive advantages, if at all, and they may prove to be unenforceable. Further, the scope of protection of issued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will issue, or that our issued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. Moreover, others may design around our issued patents or independently develop technologies that are competitive to us. \nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, products, and other proprietary rights is expensive and difficult to enforce, particularly internationally. In addition, patent and trademark protections may not be available in all countries in which we operate or in which we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights. We believe that our patents are foundational in the area of LiDAR products and intend to enforce the intellectual property portfolio we have built over the years. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or reverse engineer our LiDAR technology or certain aspects of our solutions that we consider proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to prevent unauthorized parties from copying or reverse engineering our solutions, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to block the importation of infringing products into the U.S.\nAny such litigation, whether initiated by us or a third party, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Even if we obtain favorable outcomes in litigation, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies, especially in the context of unauthorized parties copying or reverse engineering our solutions. \nTable of Contents\n\nFurther, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defending intellectual property infringement claims and to enforcing their intellectual property rights than we have. Attempts to enforce our rights against third parties could also provoke these third parties to assert their own intellectual property or other rights against us or result in a holding that invalidates or narrows the scope of our rights, in whole or in part. Effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available, and competitors based in other countries may sell infringing products in one or more markets. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. \nThird-party claims that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses, and our business could be adversely affected. \nAlthough we hold key patents related to our products, a number of companies, both within and outside of the LiDAR industry, hold other patents covering aspects of LiDAR products. In addition to these patents, participants in this industry typically also protect their technology, especially embedded software, through copyrights and trade secrets. As a result, there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received, and in the future may receive, inquiries from other intellectual property holders and may become subject to claims that we infringe their intellectual property rights, particularly as we expand our presence in the market, expand to new use cases and face increasing competition. In addition, third parties may claim that the names and branding of our products infringe their trademark rights in certain countries or territories. If such a claim were to prevail, we may have to change the names and branding of our products in the affected territories, and we could incur other costs. \nWe currently have a number of agreements in effect pursuant to which we have agreed to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless our customers, suppliers, channel partners, and other partners from damages and costs that may arise from the infringement by our products of third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. The scope of these indemnity obligations varies, but may, in some instances, include indemnification for damages and expenses, including attorneys’ fees. Our insurance may not cover all intellectual property infringement claims. A claim that our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, even if untrue, could adversely affect our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from purchasing our products, and could expose us to costly litigation and settlement expenses. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party relating to infringement by our products, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our products against intellectual property infringement claims in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Any of these results could adversely affect our brand and operating results. \nOur defense of intellectual property rights claims brought against us or our customers, suppliers, and channel partners could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, divert management resources and attention, and force us to acquire intellectual property rights and licenses, which may involve substantial royalty or other payments and may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Further, a third party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or obtain an injunction. An adverse determination also could invalidate our intellectual property rights and adversely affect our ability to offer our products to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute products that do not infringe, which could require significant effort and expense. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition. \nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes, and know-how. \nWe rely on proprietary information (such as trade secrets, know-how, and confidential information) to protect intellectual property that may not be patentable or subject to copyright, trademark, trade dress, or service mark protection, or that we believe is best protected by means that do not require public disclosure. We generally seek to protect this proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements, consulting services, or employment agreements that contain non-disclosure and non-use provisions with our employees, consultants, contractors, and third parties. However, we may fail to enter into the necessary agreements, and even if entered into, these agreements may be breached or may otherwise fail to prevent disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary information, may be limited as to their term, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use of proprietary information. We have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our current or future manufacturing partners and suppliers and could lose future trade secret protection if any unauthorized disclosure of such information occurs. In addition, our proprietary information may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors or other third parties. \nTo the extent that our employees, consultants, contractors, advisors, and other third parties use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to \nTable of Contents\n\nobtain or maintain protection for our proprietary information could adversely affect our competitive business position. Furthermore, laws regarding trade secret rights in certain markets where we operate may afford little or no protection to our trade secrets. \nWe also rely on physical and electronic security measures to protect our proprietary information, but we cannot provide assurance that these security measures will not be breached or provide adequate protection for our property. There is a risk that third parties may obtain and improperly utilize our proprietary information to our competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to detect or prevent the unauthorized use of such information or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. \nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our employees’ former employers. \nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of an employee’s former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and demand on management resources. \nWe use certain software and data governed by open-source licenses, which under certain circumstances could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCertain of our software and data, as well as that of our customers and vendors, may be derived from or otherwise incorporate so-called “open source” software and data that is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Some open-source software is made available under licenses that impose certain obligations on us regarding modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open-source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of license we customarily use to protect our intellectual property. Additionally, if we combine our proprietary software with open-source software in certain manners, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software or to make our proprietary software available under open-source licenses to third parties at little or no cost or on unfavorable license terms. In the event that the copyright holder of, or other third party that distributes, open-source software alleges that we have not complied with the terms of an open-source license, we could incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations. If such claims are successful, we could be subject to significant damages, required to release the source code that we developed using that open-source software to the public, enjoined from distributing our software and/or required to take other actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we take steps to monitor the use of open-source software in our solutions, processes, and technology and try to ensure that no open-source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to the related product, processes, or technology when we do not wish to do so, such use could inadvertently occur. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated certain types of open-source software into software we license from such third party for our solutions, processes, or technology, we could, under certain circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our solutions, processes, or technology. This could harm our intellectual property position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurther, the use of open-source software can lead to vulnerabilities that may make our software susceptible to attack, and although some open-source vendors provide warranty and support agreements, it is common for such software to be available “as is” with no warranty, indemnity, or support. Although we monitor our use of such open-source code to avoid subjecting our solutions to unintended conditions, such use, under certain circumstances, could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including if we are required to take remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n The large amount of our outstanding indebtedness and liabilities limits the cash flow available for our operations and exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our total indebtedness was $500.5 million, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs. Our indebtedness comprised of $201.0 million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the “2026 Convertible Senior Notes”), $95.5 million in aggregate principal amount of first-lien, senior secured floating rate notes (the “Senior Notes”), and $204.0 million in aggregate principal amount of second-lien, convertible senior secured notes due 2030 (the “2030 Convertible Notes” and together with the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes, the “Convertible Notes”, \nTable of Contents\n\nand together with the Convertible Notes and the Senior Notes, the “Notes”), which we issued in August 2024. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our securities holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things:\n•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n•requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n•limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;\n•diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our Class A common stock upon conversion of the notes; and\n•placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, the Notes contain, and any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. \nThe terms of our Senior Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes require us to maintain minimum liquidity and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we fail to comply with any covenants contained in the indentures governing the notes, holders may declare all of the applicable series of notes to be due and payable, and in the case of the Senior Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes, exercise rights with respect to collateral securing those notes.\nThe Senior Notes are secured by a first priority lien on, and the 2030 Convertible Notes are secured by a second priority lien on, substantially all of our and the guarantors’ assets (including intellectual property) and are guaranteed by certain of our current and future material subsidiaries on a senior secured basis and a second-priority senior secured basis, respectively, subject to certain criteria and exceptions.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things: (i) incur, assume, or guarantee additional indebtedness; (ii) grant or incur liens securing indebtedness; (iii) make certain restricted payments and investments; (iv) sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries; (v) enter into transactions with affiliates; (vi) in the case of us and any guarantor, consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to, another person; (vii) declare or pay dividends or make other distributions; and (viii) make modifications to certain of our material debt agreements. In addition, the indenture governing the Senior Notes contains a covenant that provides that we may not permit liquidity (calculated as the sum of (a) unused commitments then available to be drawn under any revolving credit facility permitted under the indenture, plus (b) the amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held by us and our subsidiary guarantors) to be less than $35.0 million as of the last day, or for more than 5 days, of any calendar month. The indenture governing the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes contain similar restrictive covenants and a similar minimum liquidity requirement, but at a $31.5 million level.\nIf we fail to comply with these or any of the other covenants under the indentures governing the Notes and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, the holders of notes may, among other things, declare all of the applicable series of Notes to be due and payable and, with respect to the Senior Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes, exercise rights with respect to collateral securing those notes, each of which could significantly harm our business, prospects, and financial condition, and could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nUnder the indentures governing the Senior Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes, if we do not reduce the outstanding principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes to less than $100 million by June 30, 2026, the maturity date of the Senior Notes and the 2030 Convertible Notes will advance to September 15, 2026.\nThe Senior Notes will mature on the earlier of (i) August 15, 2028 or (ii) if more than $100 million of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes remain outstanding as of June 30, 2026, then September 15, 2026. The 2030 Convertible Notes will mature on the earlier of (i) January 15, 2030 or (ii) if more than $100 million of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes remain outstanding as of June 30, 2026, then September 15, 2026. If we are unable to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes to less than $100 million by June 30, 2026, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to raise funds sufficient to pay the Senior Notes and 2030 Convertible Notes on their earlier maturity date.\nTable of Contents\n\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nUnder the indenture governing our Senior Notes, if a “change of control” occurs, and under the indenture governing the 2030 Convertible Notes, if a “fundamental change” occurs, then the respective holders may require us to repurchase their respective notes at a cash repurchase price equal to 103% and 100%, respectively, of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A holder that elects to convert its 2030 Convertible Notes in connection with a fundamental change may be entitled to receive a make-whole adjustment to the conversion rate for such notes in connection with such corporate event in certain circumstances. The definition of “fundamental change” includes certain business combination transactions involving us and certain de-listing events with respect to our Class A common stock. In addition, upon conversion, we may satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash, shares of our Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares, at our election. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the notes or pay any cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our existing and any future indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the notes or pay any cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase notes or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion or when otherwise required will constitute a default under the indentures governing the notes. A default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes or a default under the indenture governing the 2030 Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing other indebtedness which we have incurred or may incur, which may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the notes. \nThe accounting method for the notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board published an Accounting Standards Update, which we refer to as ASU 2020-06, to reduce the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments. The elimination of the separate accounting to reduce the interest expense that we have recognized and expect to recognize in the future for the notes for accounting purposes. Under ASU 2020-06, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, the notes are accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. Further, ASU 2020-06 eliminated the use of the treasury stock method for convertible instruments that can be settled in whole or in part with equity, and instead requires application of the “if-converted” method. Under that method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the notes were converted solely into shares of Class A common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share.\nFurthermore, if any of the conditions to the convertibility of the notes is satisfied, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of such notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option and holders of the new secured convertible notes are entitled to convert their notes at any time at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nIf a significant portion of our Convertible Notes were converted, the number of shares of Class A common stock that would be issued upon conversion will cause substantial dilution to our stockholders. In addition, upon conversion of the 2030 Convertible Notes issued in August 2024 (except a conversion following certain events that constitute a “make-whole fundamental change”), we would be required to pay a make-whole premium upon conversion equal to the lesser of (i) all regularly scheduled interest payments that would be due on the portion of such secured convertible notes being redeemed for the succeeding two year period and (ii) all regularly scheduled interest payments that would be due on the portion of such secured convertible notes being redeemed through the maturity date, and is capped at the maximum number of shares that would be issuable in connection with a “make-whole fundamental change”.\nTable of Contents\n\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes and our Class A common stock.\nIn connection with the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nWe have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchased shares of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, the option counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions from time to time prior to the maturity of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes, any repurchase of the 2026 Convertible Senior Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date, or any other date on which the notes are retired by us, in each case if we exercise the relevant election to terminate the corresponding portion of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions, and the capped call transactions may not operate as planned.\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that they might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions, including the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its various affiliates. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated with an increase in the market price or the volatility of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty.\nIn addition, the capped call transactions are complex, and they may not operate as planned. For example, the terms of the capped call transactions may be subject to adjustment, modification or, in some cases, renegotiation if certain corporate or other transactions occur. Accordingly, these transactions may not operate as we intend if we are required to adjust their terms as a result of transactions in the future or upon unanticipated developments that may adversely affect the functioning of the capped call transactions.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Shares\nWe will require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations, and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. \nWe have been dependent on proceeds from our Equity Financing Program and debt financing to make payments on our liabilities and to fund certain other activities, and we will need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing or incurring other indebtedness in order to continue to pay our liabilities, fund operations and execute on our business plan. However, any decline in the market price of our Class A common stock could impair our ability to raise capital. Separately, additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations and fund our operations. Because our decision to issue debt or equity in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature, or success of our future capital raising efforts.\nSecurities and agreements involving the issuance of debt will generally rank senior to the Class A common stock and have priority in the event of a liquidation. Such securities also may be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting the Company’s operating flexibility. For example, the indentures governing our debt financing arrangements contain restrictive covenants and in some cases, a minimum liquidity requirement. For more information relating to these notes, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of the Class A common stock and would further dilute existing \nTable of Contents\n\nstockholders. For example, we have an at-the-market program, which we entered in May 2024, to issue and sell up to $150.0 million of shares of our Class A common stock through a sales agent under the Equity Financing Program. In August 2024, we increased the Equity Financing Program by an additional $50.0 million and in March 2025, we further increased the program by an additional $75.0 million. We issued and sold $89.4 million under the Equity Financing Program in 2024. In addition, in order to further business relationships with current or potential partners, vendors, or other parties, we have issued, and in the future may issue equity or equity-linked securities to such current or potential partners, vendors, or other parties. Sales of shares of Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales or conversions might occur, may depress the market price of Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. \nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Chancery Court”) will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a chosen judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees, or stockholders. \nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers, and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought in the Chancery Court or, if that court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, another federal or state court situated in the State of Delaware. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. In addition, our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any suit brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the Securities Exchange Act on 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation further provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the U.S. will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. \nIn March 2020, the Delaware Supreme Court issued a decision in Salzburg et al. v. Sciabacucchi, which found that an exclusive forum provision providing for claims under the Securities Act to be brought in federal court is facially valid under Delaware law. We intend to enforce this forum provision, but we do not know whether courts in other jurisdictions will agree with this decision or enforce it.\nThe choice of forum providing that a state or federal court located within the state of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. If any other court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. \nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock. \nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include: \n•providing for a classified Board of Directors with staggered, three-year terms; \n•authorizing our Board to issue Preferred Stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could discourage a takeover attempt or delay changes in control; \n•prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; \n•providing that vacancies on our Board may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; \n•prohibiting the adoption, amendment or repeal of the Amended and Restated Bylaws or the repeal of the provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors without the required approval of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors; \n•prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; \nTable of Contents\n\n•limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and \n•requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals. \nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our Board. \nThese and other provisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and our Amended and Restated Bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of Class A common stock, and result in the market price of Class A common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions. \nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us. \nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. \nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, the Amended and Restated Bylaws and the indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that: \n•we will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful; \n•we may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law; \n•we will be required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if we are ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification; \n•we will not be obligated pursuant to our Amended and Restated Bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our Board or brought to enforce a right to indemnification; \n•the rights conferred in the Amended and Restated Bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees, and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons; and \n•we may not retroactively amend our Amended and Restated Bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees, and agents. \nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with Austin Russell, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. This will limit or preclude stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters, including the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control. \nShares of our Class B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (“Class B common stock”), have 10 votes per share, while shares of Class A common stock have one vote per share. Austin Russell, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, currently holds all of the issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Russell held approximately 56.1% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2024 and will be able to control matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transactions. Mr. Russell may have interests that differ from the interests of other stockholders of the Company and may vote in a way with which other stockholders of the Company disagree and which may be adverse to other stockholders’ interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of the Company, and might ultimately affect the market price of shares of Class A common stock. \nIn connection with the execution of the merger agreement in connection with our business combination (the “Business Combination”) with Gores Metropoulos, Inc. (“Gores”), Austin Russell entered into a voting agreement, dated as of August 24, \nTable of Contents\n\n2020 (the “Voting Agreement”) with Gores. Under the Voting Agreement, Mr. Russell agreed that, following the consummation of the Business Combination, if he is involuntarily terminated from his position as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company as a result of his conviction of, or pleading guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony that has a material negative impact on the Company, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which directors are to be elected following the consummation of the Business Combination, Mr. Russell, or any of his permitted successors or assigns, will not vote more than 10% of the Class B common stock he or they beneficially own in any director election. \nWe are a controlled company within the meaning of The Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards, and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies. To the extent we utilize any of these exemptions, holders of our capital stock will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements. We do not currently intend to rely on the exemptions afforded to controlled companies at this time. \nSo long as more than 50% of the voting power for the election of our directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company, we will qualify as a “controlled company” under The Nasdaq Stock Market listing requirements. Austin Russell controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, we are a “controlled company” under the Nasdaq Stock Market rules. As a controlled company, we are exempt from certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, including those that would otherwise require our Board to have a majority of independent directors and require that we establish a compensation committee comprised entirely of independent directors, or otherwise ensure that the compensation of our executive officers and nominees for directors are determined or recommended to our Board by independent members of our Board. While we do not currently rely on any of these exemptions, we will be entitled to do so for as long as we are considered a “controlled company,” and to the extent we rely on one or more of these exemptions, holders of our capital stock will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of Nasdaq’s corporate governance requirements.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company which allows us to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our annual report, periodic reports and proxy statements and providing only two years of audited financial statements in our annual report and periodic reports. We cannot predict whether investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\nOur dual class structure may depress the trading price of the Class A common stock. \nOur dual class structure may result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences due to disfavor of a dual class structure by certain organizations. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell had previously announced changes to their eligibility criteria for inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the S&P 500, pursuant to which companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock are excluded. In addition, several stockholder advisory firms have policies that oppose the use of multiple class structures. As a result, the dual class structure of our common stock may cause stockholder advisory firms to publish negative commentary about our corporate governance practices or otherwise seek to cause us to change our capital structure. Any such exclusion from indices or any actions or publications by stockholder advisory firms critical of our corporate governance practices or capital structure could adversely affect the value and trading market of our Class A common stock. \nThe market price and trading volume of Class A common stock is volatile and could decline significantly. \nThe market price of our Class A common stock has been and is expected to continue to be volatile and has experienced continued declines. In addition, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of Class A common stock will not fluctuate widely or decline significantly in the future in response to a number of factors, including, among others, the following: \n•the realization of any of the risk factors presented in this Form 10-K; \n•actual or anticipated differences in our estimates, or in the estimates of analysts or investors, for our revenues, margins, results of operations, level of indebtedness, liquidity or financial condition; \n•additions and departures of key personnel; \nTable of Contents\n\n•failure to comply with the requirements of Nasdaq, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or other laws or regulations; \n•future issuances, sales, resales or repurchases or anticipated issuances, sales, resales, or repurchases, of our securities; \n•publication of research reports and news articles about us; \n•the performance and market valuations of other similar companies; \n•commencement of, or involvement in, litigation involving us; \n•broad disruptions in the financial markets, including sudden disruptions in the credit markets; \n•speculation in the press or investment community; \n•actual, potential or perceived control, accounting, or reporting problems; \n•changes in accounting principles, policies, and guidelines; and \n•other events or factors, including those resulting from infectious diseases, health epidemics, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, or responses to these events. \nIn the past, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their shares. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us. \nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, then the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline. \nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, publish less favorable research or reports, or provide more favorable research and recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If any of the analysts who cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price of our Class A common stock and/or trading volume to decline. \nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our securities. \nDue to declines in our stock price, we failed to meet Nasdaq’s minimum closing bid price requirement in 2024, and as a result, we completed a 1-for-15 reverse stock split in order to regain compliance with this listing requirement. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements, or fail to satisfy the minimum closing bid price requirement again, Nasdaq will take steps to delist our securities unless we appeal and are successful in such appeal. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our Class A common stock and would impair the ability of stockholders to sell or purchase their securities and could constitute a “fundamental change” under the terms of our indebtedness which would require us to repurchase certain of our indebtedness, and if we are unable to do so, such failure would constitute a default and could have a material adverse effect on us. For more information about risks related to a “fundamental change,” see “We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the notes or pay cash upon their conversion.” \nIn the event of a delisting, we can provide no assurance that any action taken by us to restore compliance with the listing requirements would allow our securities to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our Class A common stock, prevent the stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement, or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements. Additionally, if our securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. Stockholders may then be unable to sell their securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nTable of Contents\n\nGeneral Risks\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \nWe will be subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions, and our tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including: \n•changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; \n•expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances; \n•tax effects of stock-based compensation; \n•costs related to intercompany restructurings; \n•changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof;\n•changes in accounting and tax standards or practices; \n•changes in the composition of operating income by the taxing jurisdiction; or\n•lower-than-anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher-than-anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates. \nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales, and other transaction taxes by taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. \nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law making significant changes to the U.S. Tax Code. In particular, sweeping changes were made to the U.S. taxation of foreign operations. Changes include, but are not limited to, a reduction to the corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, assessing a repatriation tax or “toll-charge” on undistributed earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions, including a new minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and base erosion and anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”). The new legislation did not have a material impact on our provision for income taxes for 2020 and 2019, because we generated net tax losses and offset our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet with a full valuation allowance due to our current loss position and forecasted losses for the near future.\nIn addition to the impact of the Tax Act on our federal taxes, the Tax Act has impacted our taxation in other jurisdictions, including state income taxes. Additionally, other foreign governing bodies may enact changes to their tax laws in reaction to the Tax Act that could result in changes to our global tax position and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, (the “IRS”) and several foreign tax authorities have increasingly focused attention on intercompany transfer pricing with respect to sales of products and services and the use of intangibles. Tax authorities could disagree with our future intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, or other matters and assess additional taxes. If we do not prevail in any such disagreements, our profitability may be affected.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations, which can harm our business. \nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. \nThe current conflict between Ukraine and Russia and Israel-Hamas war have exacerbated market instability and disrupted the global economy and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe current conflict between Ukraine and Russia and Israel-Hamas war have caused uncertainty about economic and political stability, increasing volatility in the credit and financial markets and disrupting the global economy. The United States, \nTable of Contents\n\nthe European Union, and several other countries are imposing far-reaching sanctions and export control restrictions on Russian entities and individuals. These sanctions and export controls may also contribute to higher oil and gas prices and inflation, which could reduce demand in the global automotive industry and therefore reduce demand for our products. There is also a risk that Russia launches sanctions and other retaliatory actions. Additional consequences of the conflict may include diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, and various shortages and supply chain disruptions. While we do not currently directly rely on goods or services sourced in Russia, Ukraine, or Israel, and thus have not experienced any direct disruptions, we may experience indirect disruptions in our supply chain. \nThe recent Israel-Hamas war and escalating tensions in the region could result in, among other things, additional supply chain disruptions, rising prices for oil and other commodities, volatility in capital markets and foreign exchange rates, any of which may adversely affect our business. In addition, the conflicts, along with any global political fallout and implications including sanctions, shipping disruptions, collateral war damage, and a potential expansion of the conflict, could disturb the global economy. \nAny of the foregoing factors, including developments or effects that we cannot yet predict, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, global pandemics, and interruptions by man-made problems, such as terrorism. Material disruptions of our business or information systems resulting from these events could adversely affect our operating results. \nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood, hurricane, or significant power outage or other similar events, such as infectious disease outbreaks or pandemic events, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. One of our offices is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war could cause disruptions in our manufacturing operations, our or our customers’, our suppliers’, or channel partners’ businesses, or the economy as a whole. We also rely on information technology systems to communicate among our workforce and with third parties. Any disruption to our communications, whether caused by a natural disaster or by man-made problems, such as power disruptions, could adversely affect our business. We do not have a formal disaster recovery plan or policy in place and do not currently require that our suppliers’ partners have such plans or policies in place. To the extent that any such disruptions result in delays or production or cancellations of orders, or impede our suppliers’ ability to timely deliver products and components, or delays in the deployment of our products, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.",
