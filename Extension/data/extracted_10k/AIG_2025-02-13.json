The three segments are North America Commercial, International Commercial and Global Personal. Other Operations predominantly consists of Net Investment Income from our AIG Parent liquidity portfolio, Corebridge dividend income, corporate General operating expenses, and Interest expense. Prior years’ presentations have been recast to conform to the new reportable segments. Our General Insurance business (General Insurance) consists of our three segments and the Net investment income related to our insurance operations.\nIn September 2022, AIG closed on the initial public offering of Corebridge. Since then and through June 9, 2024, AIG has sold portions of its interests in Corebridge through secondary public offerings. On June 9, 2024, AIG held 48.4 percent of Corebridge common stock, waived its right to majority representation on the Corebridge Board of Directors and one of AIG's designees resigned from the Corebridge Board of Directors as of June 9, 2024 (the Deconsolidation Date). As a result, AIG met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge. The historical financial results of Corebridge, for all periods presented, are reflected in these Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations. \nFor additional information on our segments, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Business Segment Operations and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and for information regarding the separation of Life and Retirement and our global individual personal travel insurance and assistance business, see Notes 1 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nGeneral Insurance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nGeneral Insurance is a leading provider of insurance products and services for commercial and personal insurance customers.

MD&A – Critical Accounting Estimates – Loss Reserves, Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Insurance Reserves – Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses (Loss Reserves), and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor additional information on investment strategies, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Investments – Investment Strategies.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1 | Business\n\nHuman Capital Management\nOur talented and dedicated colleagues are our greatest asset and support our culture of underwriting expertise and excellence. To this end, we place significant focus on human capital management; namely retaining, developing and attracting high caliber talent.\nOur Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (CMRC) is responsible for overseeing human capital management practices and programs, including retention, talent development and compensation and benefits. Management periodically reports to the CMRC on our various human capital management initiatives and metrics, including succession planning for key roles. \nAt December 31, 2024, we had approximately 22,200 employees based in approximately 46 countries, of which 47 percent are located in North America, 26 percent are in the Asia Pacific region and the remaining 27 percent are in the European, Middle East and Africa (EMEA region) and Latin America.\nWe believe that we foster a constructive and healthy work environment for our employees. The key programs and initiatives that are designed to attract, develop and retain our workforce include:\nCompetitive Compensation and Benefits. We seek to align compensation with individual and Company performance and provide the appropriate market-competitive incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve outstanding results.\nManagement and the CMRC engage the services of third-party compensation consultants to help monitor the competitiveness of our incentive programs. We provide a performance-driven compensation structure that consists of base salary and, for eligible employees, short- and long-term incentives. We also offer comprehensive benefits to support the health, wellness, work-life balance and retirement preparedness/savings needs of our employees, including, for eligible employees, subsidized health care plans, life and disability insurance, wellness and mental health benefits, legal assistance plan, paid time off, 16 hours of paid volunteer time off, 2:1 matching grants for eligible charitable donations, parental and bonding leave and both matching and Company 401(k) contributions for eligible employees. \nHealth and Wellness. The health, safety and wellness of our employees is a priority. We offer numerous benefits and wellness programs focused on the physical, social and financial wellness of our employees. Nearly every country in which we operate has an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which provides employees with confidential counselling, mental health resources and information to help employees and their dependents through times of stress and anxiety. In many countries where local market and regulations permit, our EAP and other programs also offer work-life balance assistance, eldercare advice, bereavement support, and legal and financial guidance. \nWe also maintain the AIG Compassionate Colleagues Fund (the Fund), which enables the Company and its employees to provide direct relief to help eligible colleagues overcome unforeseen financial hardships and disasters. Since its inception in 2021, the Fund has helped approximately 2,500 employees in 17 countries. \nTalent Development. Equipping our people with the skills and capabilities to be successful and contribute to AIG is another priority. We do this by giving our employees access to meaningful tools and resources to assist in their professional development no matter where they are in their career paths. \nWe offer numerous learning opportunities to support the development of our employees. All online learning programs are accessible through a global learning management system, Your Learning Journey. Through these programs, employees can increase their insurance and business knowledge, build critical job skills and earn continuing education credits. \nAlongside online courses, we offer a series of live, interactive learning opportunities designed to reinforce our culture of excellence. These programs focus on providing employees with a strong foundation of core skills including communication, collaboration, coaching, change agility and problem solving. In addition to live courses and online training, we also offer tuition and certification training reimbursement to encourage employees to enhance their education and skills. \nAdditionally, we focus on building managerial capability for people managers through a series of interactive learning experiences focused on skills needed to lead teams effectively and achieve business priorities. To assess leadership skills and capabilities, we use distinct leadership assessment tools, including 360 degree feedback, which develops self-awareness and builds personalized leadership development goals. \nWe also place significant importance on promoting internal talent and succession planning. Accordingly, we use a globally consistent streamlined process to support succession planning and talent development. This approach helps identify a pipeline of talent for positions at all levels of the organization and the actions needed to support their development. In 2024, 39 percent of all our open positions were filled with internal talent.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1 | Business\n\nCulture of Inclusion. We strive to create an inclusive workplace that provides equal opportunities for all colleagues. We believe in building a culture where everyone is valued and where all perspectives are welcome. \nRegulation\nGENERAL\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which our insurance businesses are located or operate. Insurance regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions are the primary regulators for those businesses; however, our operations are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance, securities and derivatives regulators in the United States and abroad.\nInsurance regulators, other regulatory authorities, law enforcement agencies, and other governmental authorities from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations regarding our compliance, as well as compliance by other companies in our industry, with applicable laws. In addition, regulation, legislation and administrative policies that are not limited in application solely to the insurance market may significantly affect the insurance industry and certain of our operations, including regulation, legislation and administrative policies related to privacy, cybersecurity, government sanctions, anti-discrimination, financial services, securities, taxation and climate change. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation – \"Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in laws and regulations may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability\".\nWe expect that the U.S. and international regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulation – \"New laws and regulations or new interpretations of current laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, may affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively\".\nFINANCIAL, MARKET CONDUCT & CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERSIGHT\nThe method of insurance regulation of our insurance subsidiaries varies, but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory and supervisory powers to a state insurance official (in the United States) or another governmental agency (outside the United States). The regulation and supervision relate primarily to the financial condition of the insurers, corporate conduct and market conduct activities. In general, such regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than the creditors or equity owners of these companies. Financial, market conduct and corporate conduct oversight varies by jurisdiction, but can include activities such as:\n(a)approval of policy language and rates;\n(b)advertising practices;\n(c)establishing minimum capital and liquidity requirements;\n(d)licensing of insurers and their agents;\n(e)requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies that are licensed in the jurisdiction;\n(f)evaluating and, in some cases, requiring regulatory approval of, certain transactions between insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates;\n(g)imposing restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by an insurance company;\n(h)enforcing rules related to outsourcing of material functions;\n(i)requiring deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;\n(j)establishing requirements for acceptability of reinsurers and credit for reinsurance;\n(k)establishing requirements for reserves; and\n(l)enterprise risk management (including technology risk management) and corporate governance requirements.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to laws and regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments they can make and permissible investment practices, such as derivatives, securities lending and repurchase transactions. In non-U.S. jurisdictions, our insurance subsidiaries may also be subject to laws requiring certain amounts and types of local investment. \nInsurance laws in many jurisdictions also provide that no person, corporation or other entity may acquire control of an insurance company, or a controlling interest in (or prescribed percentage of capital of) any direct or indirect parent company of an insurance company, without the prior approval of, or notice to, such insurance company’s domiciliary insurance regulator.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1 | Business\n\nAs a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, AIG Parent depends on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations. U.S. state insurance laws typically provide that dividends in excess of certain prescribed limits are considered to be extraordinary dividends and require prior approval or non- disapproval from the applicable insurance regulator. Outside the U.S., insurers, subject to certain exceptions, are permitted to pay dividends subject to maintaining prescribed capital and solvency requirements and ensuring that dividends are made out of profits/retained earnings.\nFurther, as part of their regulatory oversight processes, insurance regulators conduct periodic examinations of our insurance subsidiaries. Such examinations can cover a broad scope of the insurance subsidiary’s operations, including the financial strength of the insurance subsidiary; sales, marketing and claims handling practices; risk management; capital and liquidity management; and information technology operations (including emerging technology risks).\nInsurance and securities regulators and other law enforcement agencies and attorneys general also, from time to time, make inquiries, issue data calls and conduct examinations or investigations regarding compliance with insurance and other laws or for informational purposes that can be company-specific or part of a broader industry-wide effort.\nThere can be no assurance that any noncompliance with such applicable laws, regulations or guidance would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nREGULATORY REGIMES\nUnited States\nStates\nAt the state-level, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is a standard-setting and regulatory support organization created and governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. The NAIC is not a regulator, but it assists state insurance regulators in establishing standards and best practices, conducting peer reviews and coordinating regulatory oversight. Model laws and regulations promulgated by the NAIC only become effective in a state once formally adopted by such state and are subject to revision by each state. Examples of NAIC models adopted in substantial part by all states include:\n•The Risk-Based Capital (RBC) for Insurers Model Act, which incorporates an RBC formula calculated in accordance with instructions updated annually by the NAIC that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer’s total adjusted capital, as calculated pursuant to the RBC formula, in relation to certain risks inherent in its business, and authorizes certain regulatory actions regarding insurers whose RBC levels fall below specific thresholds. The NAIC has adopted certain changes, and is considering others, regarding how RBC is calculated, including initiatives aimed at a comprehensive review of the RBC investment framework. The RBC levels of each of our U.S. domiciled insurance companies exceeded each of these specific thresholds as of December 31, 2024. In addition to RBC requirements, the insurance laws of our domiciliary states prescribe certain minimum capital and surplus requirements for insurance companies. If any of our insurance entities fell below prescribed levels of statutory capital and surplus, it would be our intention to provide appropriate capital or other types of support to that entity. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity and Capital Resources of AIG Parent and Subsidiaries – Insurance Companies.\n•The Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and the Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation (together, the Holding Company Models) include: provisions authorizing insurance commissioners to act as global group-wide supervisors for internationally active insurance groups and participate in supervisory colleges; standards for transactions between a domestic insurance company and its affiliates and regulatory approval requirements for certain of such transactions; requirements for obtaining regulatory approval for acquiring control of a domestic insurance company; and the requirement that the ultimate controlling person of a U.S. insurer file an annual enterprise risk report with its lead state regulator identifying risks likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of its licensed insurers or the insurance holding company system as a whole, among other requirements. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is AIG’s lead U.S.-state regulator, and leads AIG’s Supervisory College meetings, which consist of AIG’s key global regulators.\n•The Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act, which requires that insurers maintain a risk management framework, conduct an internal own risk and solvency assessment of the insurer’s material risks in normal and stressed environments, and submit annual Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) summary reports to the insurance group’s lead U.S.-state regulator.\n•The Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act (CGAD), which requires insurers to submit an annual filing regarding their corporate governance structure, policies and practices.\nThe NAIC also provides standardized insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance through the NAIC Accounting Manual, which establishes statutory accounting principles applicable to insurance companies. Statutory accounting principles promulgated by the NAIC may be modified by individual state laws, regulations and permitted practices granted by our domiciliary insurance regulators.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1 | Business\n\nThe NAIC has undertaken a multi-pronged effort to determine whether additional standards, safeguards or disclosures are required in connection with certain investments by U.S. insurance companies, including related party investments, structured securities and other complex assets.\nIn December 2020, the NAIC amended the Holding Company Models to incorporate a Group Capital Calculation (GCC) requirement, which requires the ultimate controlling person of every U.S. insurer to submit GCC reports to the insurance group’s lead state insurance regulator on an annual basis unless an exemption applies. These GCC provisions were incorporated in New York State laws in August 2023, making AIG formally subject to the GCC beginning in 2024. The GCC is intended to serve as an analytical tool for evaluating a firm’s capital position at the group level and is not intended as a prescribed group capital requirement.\nU.S. states have state insurance guaranty associations in which insurers admitted in the state are required by law to be members. Member insurers may be assessed by the associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The aggregate assessments levied against us have not been material to our financial condition in any of the past three years.\nFederal\nAt the U.S. federal level, AIG is impacted by the activities of policymakers and by the laws and regulations enforced by various federal agencies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), signed into law in 2010, brought about extensive changes to financial regulation in the United States and established the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) to serve as the central insurance authority in the federal government. While not serving a regulatory function, FIO performs certain duties related to the business of insurance and has authority to collect information on the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. In addition, FIO monitors market access issues, represents the United States in international insurance forums and has authority to determine if certain regulations are preempted by covered agreements. FIO’s approval is required to subject a financial company whose largest U.S. subsidiary is an insurer to the special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy code, administered by the FDIC pursuant to Dodd-Frank. U.S. insurance subsidiaries of any such financial company, however, would remain subject to rehabilitation and liquidation proceedings under state insurance laws.\nFIO also assists the Secretary of the Treasury in administering the U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), enacted in 2002 to support insurance coverage for certain terrorist acts in the U.S. The program was continued under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (TRIPRA) through December 31, 2027 and is intended to provide reinsurance coverage from the federal government in limited circumstances for certified acts of terrorism that exceed a certain threshold of industry losses.\nTitle I of Dodd-Frank established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council), which is authorized to determine that certain nonbank financial companies be designated as nonbank systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and enhanced prudential standards. Designation by the Council of any nonbank SIFI is subject to certain statutory and regulatory standards and to the Council’s guidance. The Council may also recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that insurers or other nonbank financial services companies engage in.\nTitle V of Dodd-Frank authorizes the United States to enter into covered agreements with foreign governments or regulatory entities regarding the business of insurance and reinsurance. On September 22, 2017, the U.S. and the European Union (EU) entered into such an agreement, and on December 18, 2018, the U.S. signed a covered agreement with the United Kingdom (UK), which is similar to the agreement with the EU. Under the agreements, AIG is subject to consolidated group supervision by its relevant U.S. insurance supervisors only, and generally does not have to satisfy EU Solvency II capital, reporting and governance requirements at the consolidated group level. The covered agreements also required various U.S. reinsurance collateral reforms, which were adopted by all U.S. states.\nTitle VII of Dodd-Frank provides for significantly increased regulation of, and restrictions on, derivatives markets and transactions that have affected various activities of insurance and other financial services companies, including (i) regulatory reporting for swaps, including security-based swaps, (ii) mandated clearing through central counterparties and execution through regulated swap execution facilities for certain swaps (other than security-based swaps) and (iii) margin and collateral requirements.\nInternational\nIn the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) is the lead prudential supervisor for our UK insurance operations and the Financial Conduct Authority has oversight of AIG’s insurance operations for consumer protection and competition matters. The Society of Lloyd’s also provides regulatory oversight of AIG’s Lloyd’s Managing Agent, Talbot Underwriting Limited.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1 | Business\n\nIn the EU, various Directives and Regulations affect our international insurance operations. The Luxembourg insurance regulator, the Commissariat aux Assurances, is the insurance regulator for AIG Europe SA, which serves our European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss policyholders. In addition, financial companies that operate in the EU are subject to a range of regulations enforced by the national regulators in each member state in which that firm operates. Solvency II governs the insurance industry’s solvency framework for the EU, including minimum capital and solvency requirements, governance requirements, risk management and public reporting standards applicable to AIG’s subsidiaries operating in the EU.\nAIG’s operating insurance subsidiaries in Bermuda are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Bermuda’s Insurance Act 1978, the applicable Codes of Conduct and related regulations impose solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies and grant the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. A variety of requirements and restrictions are imposed on our Bermuda operating insurance subsidiaries including: periodic financial reporting; corporate governance framework; solvency and financial performance; compliance with minimum enhanced capital requirements; minimum solvency margins and liquidity ratios; and limitations on dividends and distributions.\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) supervises AIG’s insurance subsidiary in Singapore. It has broad authority under the Insurance Act 1966 to regulate insurance business in Singapore as well as insurers, insurance intermediaries and related institutions. Our Singapore insurance operations are subject to minimum capital and solvency requirements as well as financial reporting, corporate governance and conduct of business requirements. The MAS has authority to conduct inspections and investigations on insurers and to administer sanctions for regulatory non-compliance. Our Singapore insurance subsidiary holds insurance entities in the Asia Pacific region. The MAS holds the Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore insurance subsidiary principally responsible for the management and conduct of the business of the subsidiary, including the business of its subsidiaries and overseas branches.\nThe Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) regulates AIG’s operating insurance subsidiaries and insurance holding company in Japan. The JFSA has extensive authority under the Insurance Business Act and related regulations to oversee licensing, sales practices, business conduct, investments, reserves and solvency, amongst other matters. Our Japanese insurance operations are required to maintain a minimum solvency margin ratio (SMR), which is a measure of capital adequacy. The failure to maintain an appropriate SMR, or comply with other similar indicators of financial health, could result in the JFSA imposing corrective actions on our operations.\nFSB and IAIS\nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) consists of representatives of national financial authorities of the G20 countries. The FSB is not a regulator but is focused primarily on promoting international financial stability. The FSB has issued a series of frameworks and recommendations to address such issues as systemic financial risk, financial group supervision, capital and solvency standards, effective recovery and resolution regimes, corporate governance including compensation, and a number of related issues associated with responses to the financial crisis.\nThe International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) represents insurance regulators and supervisors of more than 200 jurisdictions (including regions and states) in nearly 140 countries and seeks to promote globally consistent insurance industry supervision. The IAIS is not a regulator, but one of its activities is to develop insurance regulatory standards for use by local authorities across the globe. For example, the IAIS has adopted a Common Framework (ComFrame) for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs). ComFrame assists regulators in addressing an IAIG’s risks by providing supervisory standards for areas such as group supervision, governance and internal controls, enterprise risk management, and recovery and resolution planning. We currently meet the criteria set forth to identify an IAIG, and the NYDFS, as our group-wide supervisor, has publicly disclosed us as an IAIG on the IAIS’ register of IAIGs.\nWhile the FSB no longer identifies global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs); in its place the IAIS has adopted an enhanced set of supervisory policy measures for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector (Holistic Framework). The Holistic Framework recognizes that systemic risk can emanate from specific activities and exposures arising from either sector-wide trends or concentrations in individual insurers. The FSB has also been engaging with member jurisdictions in order to encourage greater adherence to its “Key Attributes for Effective Resolution Regimes for the Insurance Sector” to ensure that large, internationally active insurers can exit the market in an orderly fashion and avoid the need for taxpayer bailouts. Starting in December 2024 the FSB began publishing an annual list of insurers, including AIG, that are subject to resolution planning requirements.\nAs part of ComFrame, the IAIS also developed a risk-based global Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) applicable to IAIGs. The IAIS formally adopted the ICS at its annual general meeting in December 2024. The ICS is intended to be applied as a group-wide prescribed capital requirement, defined as a solvency control level above which the supervisor does not intervene on capital adequacy grounds. In parallel, the United States developed the Aggregation Method (AM) as an alternative approach to the consolidated ICS group-capital calculation. Following a comparability assessment, the IAIS determined in November 2024 that the AM delivers comparable outcomes to the ICS and therefore provides the basis for implementation of the ICS. The AM will be implemented in the United States through the GCC.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1 | Business\n\nThe standards issued by the FSB and/or the IAIS are not binding on the United States or other jurisdictions around the world unless and until the appropriate local governmental bodies or regulators adopt laws or regulations implementing such standards. \nPRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, CYBERSECURITY AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REQUIREMENTS\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect and safeguard personal and other sensitive information and provide notice of their practices relating to the collection, disclosure and other processing of personal information. We also are subject to U.S. federal and state laws and regulations requiring notification to affected individuals and regulators of a data breach. Below we highlight a few key applicable privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI) laws and regulations.\nIn the European Union, the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) will require covered entities, including insurance intermediaries, reinsurance intermediaries and ancillary insurance intermediaries to comply with a wide range of organizational and technical requirements to identify, manage and mitigate operational risk arising from use of network and information systems and, in particular, the use of third party information and communication technology service providers. Covered entities were required to comply with DORA by January 17, 2025.\nIn October 2017, the NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law (NAIC Data Security Model Law), which, among other things, requires insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to develop and maintain a written information security program, conduct risk assessments, and oversee the data security practices of third-party service providers. As of December 31, 2024, more than 20 jurisdictions had adopted the NAIC Data Security Model Law. In addition, on March 1, 2019, the NYDFS’s cybersecurity regulation became fully effective, requiring covered financial institutions, including insurance entities licensed in New York, to, among other things, implement a cybersecurity program designed to protect information systems. On November 1, 2023, the NYDFS published amendments to this cybersecurity regulation, which include additional obligations for large insurers including enhanced and updated governance, risk assessment, and technology requirements, new notification obligations, and clarifying changes regarding enforcement.\nThe State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which went into effect as of January 1, 2020, and imposes significant privacy obligations on businesses handling data related to California residents. The law has a number of exceptions; it does not apply to personal information collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and implementing regulations or the California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA). The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) passed in November 2020 became effective January 1, 2023 and amends the CCPA to create additional privacy rights and obligations in California. A number of other states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Texas and Virginia also enacted comprehensive consumer data privacy laws and many other states have proposed similar laws, albeit with similar exemptions for entities and/or data governed by the GLBA.\nThese privacy laws impose requirements on covered businesses that are similar to those imposed by the CCPA with respect to privacy notices, data subject rights and data security standards.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that registrants disclose any material cybersecurity incident on Form 8-K within four business days of determining that the incident the registrant has experienced is material. Periodic disclosures of, among other things, (i) details on the company’s cybersecurity policies and procedures, and (ii) cybersecurity governance and oversight policies, including the board of directors’ oversight of any material incidents (individually or in the aggregate) are also required.\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) scope extends to entities established within the EEA (i.e., EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and to certain entities not established in the EEA (in certain instances, if they solicit or target individuals in the EU by offering goods or services to EEA data subjects or monitoring the personal behavior of EEA data subjects (e.g., in an online context)). The GDPR was also onshored in the UK through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, with adjustments as provided in the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. Sanctions for non-compliance with the GDPR are onerous, with the potential for fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for the most serious infringements of the GDPR.\nWe have sought to address the GDPR’s requirements by demonstrating accountability for compliance with the GDPR’s principles relating to processing of personal data, maintaining records of processing and completing mandatory Data Protection Impact Assessments in connection with higher risk data processing activities.\nThe GDPR imposes requirements on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA, including via standard contractual clauses supplemented by an assessment and due diligence of the legal and regulatory landscape of the jurisdiction of the data importer, the channels used to transmit personal data and the processors or subprocessors of personal data.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1 | Business\n\nThe NAIC and certain U.S. states have adopted or are considering regulations and guidance relating to the use of “big data,” AI, machine learning and other technology innovations in the insurance marketplace. For example, in December 2023, the NAIC adopted a model bulletin on the use of AI by insurers that sets forth governance, risk management and other requirements that insurers using AI are expected to establish. In addition, state insurance regulators in the United States have issued and will continue to consider regulations or proposed guidelines in the use of external data, algorithms and AI in insurance practices, including underwriting, marketing, and claims practices. \nThe EEA and the UK have also taken steps to regulate the use of data and algorithms used for the purpose of AI and automated decision-making. The European Union Artificial Intelligence Act, which entered into force on August 1, 2024, and will be effective from August 2, 2026, will broadly regulate the use of AI within the European Union. European countries, and supranational political organizations like the EU and the Council of Europe, are expected to continue taking an active role in regulating AI in ways that may impact the insurance industry.\nWe also are subject to other international laws and regulations that require financial institutions and other businesses to protect personal and other sensitive information and provide notice of their practices relating to the collection, disclosure and other processing of personal information and to obtain consent for specific processing activities. We are also subject to laws and regulations requiring notification to affected individuals and regulators of security breaches and laws and regulations regarding data localization and the cross-border transfer of information.\nCLIMATE CHANGE\nIn recent years, federal- and state-level lawmakers and regulators in the United States and in other major countries in which we operate have increased their scrutiny on financial institutions’ and other companies’ governance, risk oversight, disclosures, plans, policies and practices in connection with climate change. There have been active and significant regulatory developments on these issues in the form of newly proposed, issued or implemented laws, rules, regulations, guidance and frameworks regarding climate change that impose, or will impose if and when effective, new requirements and expectations, including in connection with climate- related governance, risk management, disclosures, stress testing and scenario analysis. Regulators in several jurisdictions are considering the so-called protection gap as it relates to climate – instances in which populations are under-insured or there is insufficient coverage to protect policyholders against the risks associated with climate change. In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules on climate-related disclosure, which have been stayed pending completion of judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and which may be reconsidered by the new U.S. administration. We continue to actively monitor the regulatory landscape surrounding these issues.\nAvailable Information about AIG\nOur corporate website is www.aig.com.

In deciding whether to invest in AIG, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. Any of these risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. They could also cause significant fluctuations and volatility in the trading price of our securities. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect AIG. These factors should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC. Further, many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity above and beyond a risk’s singular impact.\nMARKET CONDITIONS \nDeterioration of economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, changes in market conditions or weakening in global capital markets have and may continue to materially affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur businesses are highly dependent on global economic and market conditions. Weaknesses in economic conditions, including a recessionary environment, poor capital markets performance, market volatility, volatility in interest rate levels and inflation have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, among other consequences, a poor operating environment, erosion of consumer and investor confidence, reduced business volumes, deteriorating liquidity and declines in asset valuations.\nKey ways in which we have been, and could be, negatively affected by economic conditions include: \n•increased loss payments and loss costs due to inflation;\n•increased challenges to insurance policy terms and conditions, such as standard exclusions;\n•increases in costs associated with third-party reinsurance, or decreased ability to obtain reinsurance on acceptable terms; \n•the increased likelihood of, or increased magnitude of, asset impairments caused by market fluctuations, deterioration in collateral values or credit deterioration of borrowers; and\n•reduced premiums.\nAdverse economic conditions may result from a variety of factors including domestic and global economic and political developments, including changes in interest rate levels, plateauing or decreasing economic growth and business activity, recessions, social inflation, inflationary or deflationary pressures in developed economies, including the United States, civil unrest, pandemics, geopolitical tensions, changes to international trade and/or tariff policies, foreign investment restrictions, or military action, such as the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia and corresponding sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries, or the conflict in Israel and the surrounding areas, and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment, hiring, migration, labor supply and global supply chains.\nThese and other market, economic, regulatory and political factors, including the effects of inflation, macroeconomic uncertainty, domestic and international political tensions, disruption to our business operations in countries exposed to geopolitical risk, natural disasters and the increased costs associated with meeting customer needs in such regions, adverse impacts resulting from changes to international trade and tariff policies, and any potential U.S. government shutdown, have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition, capital and liquidity in many ways, including:\n•lower levels of consumer demand for and ability to afford our products and commercial business activities that have decreased and may continue to decrease revenues and profitability and thus impair goodwill, deferred tax assets or other long-term assets;\n•increased credit impairments, downgrades and losses across single or numerous asset classes due to lower collateral values or deteriorating cash flow and profitability by borrowers that could lead to higher defaults on the Company’s investment portfolio, especially in geographic, industry or investment sectors where the Company has higher concentrations of exposure, and widening of credit spreads that could reduce investment asset valuations and increase statutory capital requirements;\n•increased market volatility and uncertainty that could decrease liquidity, increase borrowing costs and limit access to capital markets;\n•the reduction of investment income generated by, or the market value of, our investment portfolio;\n•increased costs related to our direct and third-party support services, labor and financing, increased credit risk and decreased sales as a result of inflationary pressures; and\n•limitations on business activities and increased compliance risks with respect to economic sanctions regulations relating to jurisdictions in which our businesses operate or we have operations.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nWe are exposed to certain risks arising from or exacerbated by fluctuations in interest rates, such as the mismatch between the expected duration of our liabilities and our assets, changes in certain statutory reserve or capital requirements that are based on formulas or models that consider interest rates or prescribed interest rates, increased financing and refinancing costs, in particular with respect to our corporate debt instruments; and lower investment income on our floating rate investments that will adjust to lower coupons if short-term rates decrease. Changes in interest rates have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio. For example, increases in interest rates have impacted, and may continue to impact, our investment portfolio by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that constitute a substantial portion of our investment portfolio as well as the alternative investments in our investment portfolio. This in turn has increased and could continue to increase the unrealized loss positions in our portfolio which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Should a low interest rate environment return, it could in the future negatively affect the performance of our investments and reduce the level of investment income earned on our investment portfolios.\nIn addition, if our investment managers fail to react appropriately to difficult market or economic conditions, our investment portfolio could incur material losses.\nRESERVES AND EXPOSURES\nThe amount and timing of insurance liability claims are difficult to predict and such claims may exceed the related liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.\nWe regularly review the adequacy of the established liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. We also conduct extensive analyses of our reserves during the year. Our liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, however, has and may develop adversely and materially impact our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nEstimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a complex process, particularly for both long-tail and medium-tail liability lines of business. There is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to new business, particularly new business involving recently introduced product lines. In these cases, there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which the actuaries can rely. Estimating reserves is further complicated by unexpected claims or unintended coverages that emerge due to unexpected events, such as pandemics or geopolitical conflicts. These emerging issues may increase the size or number of claims beyond our intent at the time of underwriting and may not become apparent for many years after a policy is issued.\nWhile we use a number of analytical reserve development techniques to project future loss development, the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses has been and may continue to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that we relied upon in setting the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be due to changes in actual versus expected claims and losses, difficulties in predicting changes, such as changes in inflation, unemployment, or other social or economic factors affecting claims, including judicial and legislative actions, and changes in the tort environment. Any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period of time after we record the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year or number of years.\nWe review and update actuarial assumptions at least annually, typically in the third quarter for reserves. If actual experience or revised future expectations result in projected future losses, we may be required to record additional liabilities through a charge to net realized gains or losses in the then-current period, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For additional information on reserve development, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Insurance Reserves.\nFor additional information on our loss reserves, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Critical Accounting Estimates – Loss Reserves and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nReinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive relative to its benefit and may not be adequate to protect us against losses. \nOur subsidiaries are major purchasers of third-party reinsurance and we use reinsurance as part of our overall risk management strategy. While reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their obligation to pay claims for losses insured under our policies, it makes the reinsurer liable to our subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk. Market conditions beyond our control have impacted and may in the future impact the availability and cost of reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, reinsurance is typically more difficult or costly to obtain after a year or consecutive years with a large number of major catastrophes, the severity and frequency of which have increased in recent years, and likelihood of which may be further exacerbated by climate change. We have been and may, at certain times be, (i) forced to incur additional costs for reinsurance, (ii) unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, or (iii) unable to obtain reinsurance for certain parts of our business. In instances where reinsurance is more costly, insufficient on acceptable terms or unavailable, we have had to, and will in the future have to accept an increase in exposure to risk, reduce or stop writing certain lines of business written by our subsidiaries or seek alternatives in line with our risk limits, or a combination thereof. \n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nAdditionally, we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our subsidiaries’ reinsurers to the extent the reinsurance receivable is not secured, or is inadequately secured by collateral or does not benefit from other credit enhancements. We also bear the risk that a reinsurer is, or may be, unwilling to pay amounts we have recorded as reinsurance recoverables for any reason, including that (i) the terms of the reinsurance contract do not reflect the intent of the parties to the contract or there is a disagreement between the parties as to their intent, or (ii) the terms of the contract cannot be legally enforced. The insolvency of one or more of our reinsurers, the inability or unwillingness of such reinsurers to make timely payments under the terms of our contracts or payments in an amount equal to our reinsurance recoverable, or the risk that the reinsurance transaction does not operate as intended, including due to a change in laws and regulations or on account of court or arbitration panel interpretations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. \nMoreover, the use of reinsurance placed in the capital markets or placed with alternative market reinsurers supported by capital market institutions, like private equity houses that fund single purpose reinsurance capital vehicles, may not provide the same levels of protection as traditional reinsurance transactions. Any disruption, volatility and uncertainty in these markets or with respect to these capital market participants or these types of alternative reinsurance structures may impact the protection provided by this type of reinsurance or may limit our ability to access such markets on terms favorable to us or at all. Also, to the extent that we intend to use structures based on an industry loss index or other non-indemnity trigger rather than on actual losses incurred by us, we could be subject to residual risk.\nThe availability of private sector reinsurance for terrorism is limited and we currently have limited reinsurance coverage for terrorist attacks. While we benefit from the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA), which provides U.S. government risk assistance to the insurance industry to manage the exposure to terrorism incidents, TRIPRA has specific program limits and does not cover losses in certain lines of business such as personal property and personal casualty. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions. The realization of these risks may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nFor additional information on our reinsurance recoverable, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks – Reinsurance Activities – Reinsurance Recoverable.\nOur consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events as well as mass torts.\nEvents such as hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, flooding, earthquakes, landslides, wildfires, solar storms, earth sinking, tsunamis, war or other military action, acts of terrorism, explosions and fires, cyberattacks, product defects, pandemics and other highly contagious diseases, mass torts, civil unrest and other catastrophes have adversely affected our business in the past and could do so in the future. \nCatastrophic events, and legislative or regulatory responses thereto, have in the past and could in the future result in losses in any business in which we operate, and could expose us to:\n•widespread claim costs associated with property, casualty, general liability, bodily injury, workers’ compensation, accident and health, travel, business interruption and cyber claims, among others;\n•loss resulting from a decline in the value of our invested assets;\n•limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets;\n•loss resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to the assumptions made in product pricing;\n•revenue loss due to decline in customer base;\n•declines in value and/or losses with respect to companies and other entities whose securities we hold and counterparties we transact business with and have credit exposure to, including reinsurers; \n•significant disruptions to our physical infrastructure, systems and operations; and\n•widespread loss or corruption of personal or sensitive business data.\nNatural and man-made catastrophic events are generally unpredictable. Our exposure to catastrophe-related loss depends on various factors, including the frequency and severity of the catastrophes, the availability of reinsurance, the rate of inflation and the value and geographic or other concentrations of insured companies and individuals. Vendor models and proprietary assumptions and processes that we use to manage catastrophe exposure may prove to be ineffective due to incorrect assumptions or estimates. For example, modeling for the more unpredictable and infrequent types of catastrophes, such as terrorism, cyber incidents and pandemics, is even more difficult and may be less reliable. \nIn addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions following major catastrophes (both natural and man-made), as well as mass torts, have required and could in the future require us to pay the insured beyond the provisions of the original insurance policy and may prohibit the application of a deductible, resulting in inflated and unanticipated claims; or impose other restrictions, which would reduce our ability to mitigate exposure. These initiatives could impair our cash flows and, without regulatory relief, could adversely impact our subsidiaries’ capital ratios.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nFor additional information on potential catastrophic events, including a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain catastrophes, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Insurance Risks.\nFor information regarding the effects of climate change on our business, see “Climate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition” below.\nClimate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nClimate change, indicated by higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, a warming atmosphere and ocean, wildfires, diminished snow and ice, and a rise in sea levels, appears to have contributed to an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters and the creation of uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. As such, climate change presents significant financial implications for us in areas such as underwriting, claims and investments, as well as risk capacity, financial reserving and operations.\nClimate change presents challenges to our ability to effectively underwrite, model and price catastrophe risk particularly if the frequency and severity of catastrophic events such as pandemics, hurricanes, tornadoes, heatwaves, floods, wildfires and windstorms and other natural disasters continues to increase. For example, losses resulting from actual policy experience may be adverse as compared to the assumptions made in product pricing and our ability to mitigate our exposure may be reduced.\nClimate change-related risks may also adversely impact the value of the securities that we hold or lead to credit risk of other counterparties we transact business with, including reinsurers. Our reputation or corporate brand could also be negatively impacted as a result of changing customer or societal perceptions of organizations that we either insure or invest in due to their actions (or lack thereof) with respect to climate change, as well as political initiatives or other stakeholder expectations with respect thereto. \nIn addition, lawmakers and regulators at the federal, state and local levels have imposed and may continue to impose new requirements or issue new guidance aimed at addressing or mitigating climate change-related risks and efforts undertaken in response thereto. Additional actions by foreign governments, regulators and international standard setters have and could result in substantial expansions of the regulations, guidance or expectations to which we may be subject. It is also possible that the laws, regulations and guidance adopted in U.S. local, state, U.S. federal or foreign jurisdictions regarding climate change-related risks will differ from one another, and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate. This could result in us having to comply with differing or inconsistent laws, regulations and guidance across jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, litigation related to climate change has increased in recent years. Many lawsuits center on enforcement or interpretation of environmental laws and regulations, often seeking to use litigation as a tool to influence governmental and corporate climate policies. Other cases seek damages for contribution to climate change or for insufficient disclosure around material financial risks, which could cause us to experience increased claims under liability policies, such as casualty and directors’ and officers’ insurance policies, increase our liabilities and affect the viability of certain of our business lines. \nIn addition, severe weather and other effects of climate change result in more frequent and more severe damages, leading to lawsuits against our insureds. Indirect climate change effects are also seen in litigation over flooding, mudslides and other severe weather that results in injury or damage, as well as in construction defect litigation, chemical release lawsuits, and workers’ compensation claims. Litigation related to climate change may, through increased claims from our customers and adverse impacts to the value of the securities that we hold, adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have also faced and may continue to face business continuity risk as a result of climate change-related incidents that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events. We cannot predict the long-term impacts of climate change on our business and results of operations.\nFor information regarding risks associated with other catastrophic events, see Reserves and Exposures – “Our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events” above.\nConcentration of our insurance, reinsurance and other risk exposures may have adverse effects.\nWe are exposed to risks as a result of concentrations in our insurance policies, investments, derivatives and other obligations that we undertake for customers and counterparties. Further, any risk management arrangements we employ to manage concentration risks, whether directly or through third parties, may not be available on acceptable terms or may prove to be ineffective. Our risk exposures under insurance policies, derivatives and other obligations are, from time to time, compounded by risk exposure assumed in the management of our investment portfolio. Also, our exposure for certain single risk coverages and other coverages may be so large that adverse experience compared to our expectations may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or result in additional statutory capital requirements for our subsidiaries. \nIn addition, the deconsolidation for accounting purposes and ongoing divestment of our stake in Corebridge, could increase the materiality of these potential concentrations in the remaining portfolio. For additional information on risks associated with our continuing equity market exposure to Corebridge, see Business Operations – “We are subject to risks from our continuing equity market exposure to Corebridge. There can be no assurances that the anticipated benefits of our sales of Corebridge stock will be achieved” below.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nAlso see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Business Segment Operations – General Insurance – Business Strategy and – Industry and Economic Factors.\nLosses due to nonperformance or defaults by counterparties may materially and adversely affect the value of our investments, our profitability and sources of liquidity.\nWe are exposed to credit risk arising from exposures to various counterparties related to investments, derivatives, premiums receivable, certain businesses and reinsurance recoverables. These counterparties include, but are not limited to, issuers of fixed income and equity securities we hold, borrowers of loans we hold, customers, plan sponsors, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivatives instruments, reinsurers, corporate and governmental entities whose payments or performance we insure, joint venture partners, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses, custodians, brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, intra-group counterparties with respect to derivatives and other third parties, financial intermediaries and institutions and guarantors. These counterparties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, financial distress, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention and other reasons. In addition, for exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures, options as well as \"cleared\" over-the-counter derivatives, we are generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house and futures commission merchants through which we clear derivatives. Defaults by these counterparties on their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nAn insolvency of, or the appointment of a receiver to rehabilitate or liquidate, a significant competitor could negatively impact our business if such appointment were to impact consumer confidence in our products and services. Additionally, if the underlying assets supporting the structured securities we invest in are expected to default or actually default on their payment obligations, our securities may incur losses.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS\nOur investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy, and the performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nOur results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the degree of concentration in our consolidated investment portfolio. For example, we have significant holdings of real estate and real estate-related investments, including residential mortgage- backed securities (both U.S. government-sponsored enterprise-issued and Non-Agency issued), and commercial mortgage-backed securities and whole loans. We also have significant exposures to domestic and global financial institutions certain industries, such as consumer discretionary and non-discretionary, the U.S. federal, state and local government issuers and authorities, and various governments globally. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industries or geographic region may adversely affect the valuation of our investments to the extent they are concentrated in such segments. Our ability to sell assets in such segments may be limited.\nOur investments are also subject to market risks and uncertainties, including, in addition to interest rate risk, changes in the level of credit spreads, currency rates, and equity prices, each of which has affected and will continue to affect the value of investments in our investment portfolio as well as the performance of, and returns generated by, such investments. For information regarding risks associated with interest rate volatility, see Market Conditions above.\nFurthermore, our alternative investment portfolio, which is subject to volatility in equity markets, includes investments for which changes in fair value are reported through pre-tax income. An economic downturn or decline in the capital markets has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our investment income, including as a result of decreases in the fair value of alternative investments.\nWe rely on investment management and advisory arrangements with third-party investment managers for the majority of our investment portfolio. The historical performance of any investment manager we engage should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our investment portfolio, our future results or any returns expected on our Common Stock.\nWe rely on external investment managers to manage the majority of our investment portfolio, consisting of liquid fixed income, certain private placement credit, certain private equity investments, commercial real estate-related equity investments and commercial mortgage loans.\nOur investment managers are generally compensated based on the size of the investment portfolios that they manage, rather than based on investment profits or income; as a result, these investment managers are not directly incentivized to maximize investment returns. Our investment portfolio’s returns have benefited historically from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not currently exist and may not be repeated. There can be no guarantee that any investment manager we engage will be able to achieve any particular returns or generate investment opportunities with attractive, risk-adjusted returns for our investment portfolio in the future. If any of our investment managers becomes unable to effectively manage our portfolio investments, the concentration of assets in our portfolio that are managed by it could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nIn addition, we have become more reliant on our external asset managers, and such increased dependence has and may reduce our internal capabilities and expertise or expose us to greater risk, including the risk that external asset managers may fail to meet our performance expectations or otherwise experience disruptions or losses.\nOur valuation of investments involves the application of methodologies and assumptions to derive estimates, which may differ from actual experience and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity or lead to volatility in our net income.\nIt has been and may continue to be difficult to value those of our investments or derivatives that are not actively traded. There also may be cases where, due to the financial environment or market conditions, normally active markets become inactive or less active, which can result in insufficient observable data. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods that are more complex. These values may not be realized in a market transaction, may not reflect the value of the asset and may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Decreases in value and/or an inability to realize that value in a market transaction or other disposition may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL AND CREDIT\nAIG Parent’s ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited, and our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs, including providing capital that may be required by our subsidiaries. \nAs a holding company, AIG Parent depends on dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund operations, pay dividends, repurchase shares, meet debt service obligations and meet the capital and liquidity needs of our subsidiaries. The majority of our investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. Any inability by our subsidiaries to make dividend or other payments in an amount sufficient to enable AIG Parent to meet its cash requirements could have an adverse effect on our operations or our business, results of operations, financial condition, capital and liquidity.\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to AIG Parent in the future will depend on their earnings, capital levels, tax considerations, covenants contained in any financing or other agreements, applicable regulatory restrictions and rating agency requirements. In addition, such payments could be limited as a result of claims against our subsidiaries by their creditors, including suppliers, vendors, lessors and employees. Additionally, our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in their ability to make dividend payments to AIG Parent in the future because of the need to meet their obligations or to support their own capital levels or because of regulatory limits and restrictions or changes in, or interpretations of, regulatory or rating agency standards.\nOur decision to pursue strategic changes or transactions in our business and operations may also subject our subsidiaries’ dividend plans to heightened regulatory scrutiny and could make obtaining regulatory approvals for extraordinary distributions by our subsidiaries, if required, more difficult. We are also subject to certain other restrictions on our capital from time to time.\nIf our liquidity is insufficient to meet our needs, we may need to have recourse to third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity, which may not be available or could be expensive. The availability and cost of any additional financing at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit, regulatory actions and our credit ratings and credit capacity. It is also possible that, as a result of such recourse to external financing, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. If AIG Parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a subsidiary, the credit rating agencies could downgrade the subsidiary’s financial strength ratings or the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could be seized by its regulator.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are required to post collateral for our insurance company subsidiaries from time to time. We may be required to post additional collateral due to regulatory changes from time to time, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor additional information on our liquidity, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nWe may not be able to generate cash to meet our needs due to the illiquidity of some of our investments. \nWe have a diversified investment portfolio. However, economic conditions as well as adverse capital market conditions, including a lack of buyers, the inability of potential buyers to obtain financing on reasonable terms, volatility, credit spread changes, interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rates and/or declines in collateral values have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, the liquidity and value of our investments.\nWe have investments in certain securities, including certain fixed income structured and privately placed securities as well as investments in private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage loans and real estate, that are less liquid than other investments. If it became necessary to sell such assets in a stressed market environment, the prices achieved in any sale may be lower than their carrying value, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Adverse changes in the valuation of real estate and real estate-linked assets, volatility or deterioration of capital markets and widening \n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\ncredit spreads have in the past, and may in the future, materially adversely affect the liquidity and the value of our investment portfolios.\nIn the event additional liquidity is required by one or more of our companies, it may be difficult for us to generate additional liquidity by selling, pledging or otherwise monetizing these or other of our investments at reasonable prices and time frames.\nA downgrade by one or more of the rating agencies in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and impair their retention of customers and in-force business, and a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nDowngrades of the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of our insurance companies could (i) prevent these companies from selling, or make it more difficult for them to succeed in selling, products and services, (ii) make it more difficult for them to obtain new reinsurance or obtain it on reasonable pricing terms, and/or (iii) result in increased policy cancellations or return of premiums. A downgrade of the IFS ratings of our insurance companies could result in a downgrade of AIG Parent’s credit ratings. In the event of a downgrade of AIG Parent’s credit ratings, our financing costs will increase and the availability of financing could be limited. A downgrade could also cause our derivative counterparties to limit or reduce their exposure to us and thus reduce our ability to manage our market risk exposures effectively.\nThese events could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFor additional information on rating agency actions, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Credit Ratings and – Financial Strength Ratings.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nOur risk management policies, standards and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \nWe have developed and continue to enhance enterprise-wide risk management policies, standards and procedures to identify, monitor and mitigate risk to which we are exposed. Our risk management policies, standards and procedures may not be sufficiently comprehensive and may not identify or adequately protect us from every risk to which we are exposed. Many of our methods of identifying, measuring, underwriting and managing risks are based upon our study and use of historical market, applicant, customer, employee and bad actor behavior or statistics based on historical models. As a result, these methods may not accurately predict future exposures from events such as a major financial market disruption as the result of a natural or man-made catastrophe, that could be significantly different than the historical measures indicate, and which could also result in claims levels not previously observed. We have and will continue to enhance our underwriting processes, including, from time to time, considering and integrating newly available sources of data to confirm and refine our traditional underwriting methods. Our efforts at implementing these improvements may not, however, be fully successful, which may adversely affect our competitive position. We have also introduced new product features designed to limit our risk and taken actions on in-force business, which may not be fully successful in limiting or eliminating risk. Moreover, our hedging programs and reinsurance strategies that are designed to manage risk rely on assumptions regarding our assets, liabilities, general market factors and the creditworthiness of our counterparties that could prove to be incorrect or inadequate. Our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and foreign exchange forwards, as well as other hedging instruments, which may not effectively or completely reduce our risk. Assumptions underlying models used to measure accumulations and support reinsurance purchases may prove inaccurate and could leave us exposed to larger than expected catastrophe losses in any given period. In addition, our current business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to reduce the impact of pandemics, a major cyber-attack, including ransomware, and other natural or man-made catastrophic events. Other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record and verify large numbers of transactions and events in each jurisdiction in which we operate. Further, various jurisdictions have unique requirements with respect to AI and environmental, social and governance matters, which may impact the efficacy of our standardized risk management tools and techniques; therefore, our policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Accordingly, our risk management policies and procedures may not adequately mitigate the risks to our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIf our risk management policies and procedures are ineffective, we may suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As our businesses change and the markets in which we operate evolve, new risks emerge, including risks posed by the rapidly developing technology associated with AI and the implementation thereof within our operations, by our third-party vendors and by competitors, and unanticipated challenges with respect thereto. As a result, new products or new business strategies may present risks that are not appropriately identified, monitored or managed. The effectiveness of our risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in losses, because of market stress or unanticipated financial market movements. In addition, there can be no assurance \n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nthat we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will understand, follow and comply with our risk management policies and procedures.\nPricing for our products is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks and estimate related losses. \nOur business is dependent on our ability to price our products effectively and charge appropriate premiums and other charges. Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors and assumptions, including proper evaluation of insurance risks, our expense levels, net investment income expected to be realized, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, legal and regulatory developments, the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes and inflation. Management establishes target returns for each product based upon the factors described above, certain underwriting assumptions and capital requirements, including statutory, GAAP and economic capital models. We monitor and manage pricing and sales to achieve target returns on new business, but we may not be able to achieve those returns, including due to the factors discussed above. Additionally, the property and casualty insurance markets are historically cyclical and experience periods of relatively strong premium rates followed by periods of increased competition that push premium rates down. Inadequate pricing and the difference between estimated results and actual results could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations and our financial condition.\nWe are exposed to certain risks if we are unable to maintain the availability of our critical technology systems and data and safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of our data, which could compromise our ability to conduct business and adversely affect our consolidated business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \nWe use information technology systems, infrastructure, including energy supply, and networks and other operational systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and use customer, employee and company data and information. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems and networks to perform necessary business functions. In the event of a natural disaster, unauthorized access, a terrorist attack, a major cyber-attack or other disruption, our systems, networks, and data may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time, and we may be unable to meet our business obligations and regulatory requirements for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled, manipulated, destroyed or otherwise compromised. Additionally, some of our technology systems are older, legacy-type systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade, and in some cases may not be able to be fully protected or to implement the latest security patches. Supply chain disruptions or delays could prevent us from maintaining and implementing changes, updates and upgrades to our systems and networks in a timely manner or at all. System and network failures or outages, including with respect to third parties, have and could compromise our ability to perform business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business, hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and expose us to legal claims as well as regulatory investigations and sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. \nSome of these technology systems also rely upon third-party systems and services, which themselves may rely on the systems and services of other third parties. Problems caused by, or occurring in relation to, our third-party providers’ systems and services, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in information technology services provided by our third-party providers and the other third parties on which they rely, our inability to acquire third-party services on commercially acceptable terms, failure of a third-party provider to perform as anticipated or in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, inability of a third-party provider to provide the required volumes of services or our third-party providers experiencing cyberattacks or data breaches, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nLike other global companies, the systems and networks we maintain and third-party systems and networks we or our vendors use are currently, and may in the future continue to be, subject to or targets of unauthorized or fraudulent access, including physical or electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering, as well as attempted cybersecurity threats such as “denial of service” attacks, phishing, automated attacks, and other disruptive attacks, including ransomware. Cyber threats are constantly evolving and the techniques used in these attacks change, develop and evolve rapidly, including the use of emerging technologies, such as advancing forms of artificial intelligence and quantum computing by nation state threat actors and criminal organizations. The new cyber risks introduced by these changes in technology, such as deepfake schemes, require us to devote significant attention to identification, assessment and analysis of the risks and implementation of corresponding preventative measures. Additionally, the frequency and sophistication of such threats continue to increase and often become further heightened in connection with geopolitical tensions. Also, like other global companies, we have an increasing challenge of retaining and attracting highly qualified personnel to assist us in combatting these security threats.\nThere is no assurance that our cybersecurity measures, including information security and technology policies and standards, administrative, technical and physical controls and other actions by us or contracted third-parties designed as preventative, will provide fully effective protection from threats to our data, systems and networks, including malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, business e-mail compromise, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, system failures and other disruptions. We maintain insurance to cover operational risks, such as cyber risk and technology outages, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of information systems or personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised. In the case of a successful ransomware attack in which our data and information systems are compromised and \n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\napplicable processes to restore access are not effective, our information could be held hostage until a ransom, which may be significant, is paid. In some cases, such a compromise may not be immediately detected which may make it difficult to restore critical services, mitigate damage to assets and maintain the integrity and security of data including our policyholder, employee, agent, and other confidential information processed through our systems and networks.\nAdditionally, since we rely heavily on information technology and systems (which is expected to increasingly include the use of artificial intelligence) and on the integrity and timeliness of data to run our businesses and service our customers, any such security event and resulting compromise of systems or data have and may impede or interrupt our business operations and our ability to service our customers, and may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThere can be no assurance that any actions taken by us to evaluate and enhance our information security and technology systems and processes, including third-party systems and services on which we rely, as well as changes designed to update and enhance our protective measures to address new threats, will decrease the risk of a system or process failure; further, such changes may create a gap in the associated security measures during the change period. Any such system or process failure or security measures gap could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by secured email and other electronic means. Although we attempt to keep such information confidential and secure, we have been, and in the future may be, unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect personal, confidential or proprietary information. Failure to secure or appropriately handle personal, confidential or proprietary information could cause a loss of data or compromised data integrity, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under U.S. and international laws and regulations, subject us to litigation, investigations, sanctions, and regulatory and law enforcement action, and result in reputational harm and loss of business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFurthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the EU or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. The variety of applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations exposes us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, requires us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses in an effort to ensure and maintain compliance and will continue to impact our business in the future by increasing legal, operational and compliance costs. While we have taken steps to comply with privacy and information security laws, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will meet the evolving standards imposed by data protection authorities. If we are found not to be in compliance with these privacy and security laws and regulations, we may be subject to additional potential private consumer, business partner or securities litigation, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations and proceedings, including class-actions. Any such developments may damage our reputation and subject us to material fines and other monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to further enhanced regulatory oversight, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, we expect that developments in privacy and cybersecurity worldwide will increase the financial and reputational implications in the event of a significant breach of our or our third-party suppliers’ information technology systems. For additional information on data protection and cybersecurity regulations, see Item 1. Business – Regulation – Privacy, Data Protection, Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence Requirements, and Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Enterprise Risk Management – Operational Risk Management – Cybersecurity Risk.\nOur foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations.\nThrough our operations, licenses and authorizations and network partners, we provide insurance solutions that help businesses and individuals in approximately 200 countries and jurisdictions protect their assets and manage risks. A substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, and we intend to continue to grow our business in strategic markets. Operations outside the United States have in the past been, and may in the future be, affected by elevated climate risks, regional economic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign interest rates, political events or upheaval, sanctions policies, nationalization and other restrictive government or regulatory actions, which could also affect our other operations.\nOur subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that these local licenses may require AIG Parent to meet certain conditions. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Consequently, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in some of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country. \nWe are subject to myriad regulations which govern items such as sanctions, bribery and anti-money laundering, for which failure to comply could expose us to significant penalties. Laws and regulations aimed at preventing money laundering, which in some jurisdictions apply to insurance companies, create obligations to know certain information about clients and take steps to monitor for suspicious activities. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. Also, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control administers regulations that restrict or prohibit dealings involving certain organizations, individuals and \n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\ncountries. The UK, the EU, Japan and other jurisdictions maintain similar laws and regulations. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, if those controls are ineffective and/or an employee or third party fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including disgorgement, and our business and our reputation could be adversely affected.\nThird parties we rely upon to provide certain business and administrative services on our behalf may not perform as anticipated, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have used and will continue to use outsourcing strategies and third-party providers to transform operational and back office processes and deliver contracted services in a broad range of areas. Such areas include, but are not limited to, administration or servicing of certain policies and contracts, finance, actuarial, information technology services related to infrastructure, and investment advisory and management services. The implementation of any technological advancements may be comprised of multiple workstreams that are complex and, have in the past and may in the future, require significant time and resource prioritization and result in delays due to the lack of sufficient resources to execute on a timely basis, inefficiencies stemming from changes that may be required to the program or sequencing, failure to meet operational and financial targets due to additional priorities or other factors. These risks may impair our ability to achieve anticipated improvements in our businesses may disrupt or may otherwise harm our operations which could materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and operations.\nFurther, third-party investment managers manage the majority of our investment assets. For information regarding our reliance on third-party investment managers, see Investment Portfolio and Concentration of Investments – “We rely on investment management and advisory arrangements with third-party investment managers for the majority of our investment portfolio. The historical performance of any investment manager we engage should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our investment portfolio, our future results or any returns expected on our Common Stock” above.\nSome of the third-party providers we use are located outside the U.S., which exposes us to business disruptions and political risks inherent to conducting business outside of the U.S. We periodically negotiate the terms of the provisions and renewal of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us, such third parties or regulators. If such third-party providers experience disruptions, fail to meet applicable licensure requirements, do not perform as anticipated or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, terminate or fail to renew our relationships, or such third-party providers in turn rely on services from another third-party provider, who experiences such disruptions, licensure failures, nonperformance or noncompliance, termination or non- renewal of its contractual relationships, we may experience operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations (including, but not limited to, contractual, legal, regulatory or policyholder obligations), a loss of business, increased costs or reputational harm, compromises to our data integrity, or suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Third parties performing regulated activities on our behalf, such as sales and servicing of insurance products, pose a heightened risk as we may be held accountable for third-party conduct that fails to comply with applicable law.\nFor information regarding cyber risk arising from third-party providers, see Business and Operations – “We are exposed to certain risks if we are unable to maintain the availability of our critical technology systems and data and safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of our data, which could compromise our ability to conduct business and adversely affect our consolidated business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity” above.\nWe may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels and the use of third parties may result in additional liabilities. \nWe maintain relationships with a number of key distributors, which results in certain distributor concentration. Distributors have in the past, and may in the future, elect to renegotiate the terms of existing relationships, such that those terms may not remain attractive or acceptable to us, limit the products they sell, including the types of products offered by us, or otherwise reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us, with or without cause. This could be due to various reasons, such as industry consolidation of distributors or other industry changes that increase the competition for access to distributors, developments in laws or regulations that affect our business or industry, including the marketing and sale of our products and services, adverse developments in our business, the distribution of products with features that do not meet minimum thresholds set by the distributor, strategic decisions that impact our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks.\nAlternatively, renegotiated terms may not be attractive or acceptable to distributors, or we may terminate one or more distribution agreements due to, for example, a loss of confidence in, or a change in control of, one of the third-party distributors. An interruption or reduction in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nKey distribution partners could merge, consolidate, change their business models in ways that affect how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, or new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact the effectiveness of our distribution efforts. \n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nAlso, if we are unsuccessful in attracting, retaining and training key distribution partners, or are unable to maintain our distribution relationships, our sales could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, substantially all of our distributors are permitted to sell our competitors’ products. If our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours or pay higher commission rates to the distribution partners than we do or for other reasons outside of our control, these distribution partners could concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors’ products instead of ours.\nIn addition, we can, in certain circumstances, be held responsible for the actions of our third-party distributors, including registered representatives, insurance agents and agencies, marketing organizations, and their respective employees, agents and representatives, in connection with the marketing and sale of our products by such parties, including the security of their operations and their handling of confidential information and personal data, in a manner that is deemed not compliant with applicable laws and regulations. This is particularly acute with respect to unaffiliated distributors where we may not be able to directly monitor or control the manner in which our products are sold through third-party firms despite our risk assessment, training and compliance programs. Further, misconduct by employees and agents in the sale of our products could also result in violations of laws by us or our subsidiaries, regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm to us. The precautions we take to prevent and detect the foregoing activities may not be effective. If our products are distributed in a manner alleged to be inappropriate, or third-party distributors experience a security or data breach due to deficient operational controls, we could suffer reputational and/or other financial harm to our business.\nOur restructuring initiatives may not yield expected reductions in expenses and/or improvements in operational and organizational efficiency. \nWe may not be able to fully realize the anticipated expense reductions and operational and organizational efficiency improvements we expect to result from our focus on our operating model and associated initiatives. Actual costs to implement these initiatives may exceed our estimates or we may be unable to fully implement and execute these initiatives as planned. Our businesses and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we are unable to realize these anticipated expense reductions and efficiency improvements or if implementing these initiatives harms our relationships with customers or employees or our competitive position. The successful implementation of these initiatives may continue to require us to effect business rationalizations, technology enhancements, business process outsourcing, workforce reductions, modifications to our operating model and other actions, which depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nBusiness or asset acquisitions and dispositions may expose us to certain risks. \nThe completion of any business or asset acquisition or disposition is subject to certain risks, including those relating to the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the terms and conditions of regulatory approvals including any financial accommodations required by regulators, our ability to satisfy such terms, conditions and accommodations, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of a transaction and the risk that parties may not be willing or able to satisfy the conditions to a transaction. As a result, there can be no assurance that any business or asset acquisition or disposition will be completed as contemplated, or at all, or regarding the expected timing of the completion of the acquisition or disposition.\nOnce we complete acquisitions or dispositions, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of any transaction. For example, the integration of businesses we acquire may not be as successful as we anticipate or there may be undisclosed risks present in such businesses. Additionally, difficulties or delays in separating a divested business from our existing infrastructure, systems and operations could reduce the anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of such transaction. Acquisitions and dispositions involve a number of risks, including operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, compliance and tax risks. Difficulties integrating an acquired business may result in the acquired business performing differently than we expected (including due to the loss of customers) or in our failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Our existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions. Risks resulting from future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In connection with a business or asset disposition, we may also hold a concentrated position in securities of the acquirer as part of the consideration, which subjects us to risks related to the price of equity securities and our ability to monetize such securities. We have also provided and may provide financial guarantees and indemnities in connection with the businesses we have sold or may sell, as described in greater detail in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While we do not currently believe that claims under these indemnities will be material, it is possible that significant indemnity claims could be made against us. If such a claim or claims were successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. \nFor additional information regarding the risks associated with our continuing equity market exposure to Corebridge, see Business and Operations – “We are subject to risks from our continuing equity market exposure to Corebridge. There can be no assurances that the anticipated benefits of our sales of Corebridge stock will be achieved” above.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nWe are subject to risks from our continuing equity market exposure to Corebridge. There can be no assurances that the anticipated benefits of our sales of Corebridge stock will be achieved.\nSince September of 2022 when we closed on the initial public offering of Corebridge’s common stock, we have continued to sell down our interest in Corebridge. On June 9, 2024, we met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge for accounting purposes. For a detailed discussion of the deconsolidation, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAlthough Corebridge has been deconsolidated from our consolidated financial results, we continue to hold a significant stake in Corebridge's common stock. At the time of deconsolidation, we elected the fair value option to account for our remaining investment in Corebridge. From that date onward, the fair value change in Corebridge’s stock, and dividends received from Corebridge, are recognized in net investment income. As a result, a decline in the market value of Corebridge common stock may result in a decrease in our investment income and may have a material and adverse effect on our results and financial condition. There can be no assurances given as to the price, transaction costs, or timing of further Corebridge stock sales and, as a result, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of our sales of such stock if there are adverse movements in its market value prior to, or at the time of, such sales.\nFurther, the sale of our remaining Corebridge stock involves a number of divestment-related risks, including (i) unanticipated developments that may delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect our ability to continue the full divestment, including an economic downturn or unfavorable capital markets conditions; (ii) unforeseen losses, liabilities or asset impairments arising from further dispositions; and (iii) challenges associated with the valuation of Corebridge and the Company as we seek to fully divest our investment in Corebridge. \nIn addition, the divestment of Corebridge, or a significant delay in our ability to continue to sell our Corebridge stock, has caused and could continue to cause the emergence, or exacerbate the effects of, many of the other risks discussed herein, including changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize certain tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nSignificant legal or regulatory proceedings may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. \nIn the normal course of business, we face significant risk from regulatory and governmental investigations and civil actions, litigation and other forms of dispute resolution in various domestic and foreign jurisdictions. We frequently engage in litigation and arbitration concerning the scope of coverage under insurance and reinsurance contracts, and face litigation and arbitration in which our subsidiaries defend or indemnify their insureds under insurance contracts.\nAdditionally, from time to time, various regulatory and governmental agencies review the transactions and practices of the Company and our subsidiaries in connection with company-specific matters, or industry-wide and other inquiries into, among other matters, the business practices of current and former operating insurance subsidiaries. Such reviews, investigations, inquiries or examinations have and could lead to extended delays to, or prohibitions of, such transactions or practices, or develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions, in which remedies could include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations to our business practices, and could result in additional expenses, limitations on certain business activities and reputational damage.\nWe, our subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors are also subject to, or may become subject to, a variety of additional types of legal disputes brought by holders of our securities, customers, employees and others, alleging, among other things, breach of contractual or fiduciary duties, bad faith, indemnification and violations of federal and state statutes and regulations. Certain of these matters may also involve potentially significant risk of loss due to the possibility of significant jury awards and settlements, punitive damages or other penalties. Many of these matters are also highly complex and seek recovery on behalf of a class or similarly large number of plaintiffs. It is therefore inherently difficult to predict the size or scope of potential future losses arising from them, and developments in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\nFor information regarding certain legal proceedings, see Notes 15 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, including governmental responses to such matters, may adversely affect our reputation or otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThere is increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders on companies’ governance, risk oversight, disclosures, plans, policies and practices regarding environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, including those related to environmental stewardship, climate change, racial justice and workplace conduct. The requirements, standards and expectations of such stakeholders may also, as a whole, reflect diverging or conflicting values or policy objectives.\nGovernmental actions to mitigate climate and other risks related to environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, or, conversely, to restrict actions companies may take in response to such risks, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Internationally and at the U.S. federal, state and local levels, regulators have imposed and likely will continue to impose requirements and guidance related to environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters, which will continue to \n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nevolve and may conflict with one another, impose additional costs on us and expose us to new or additional risks, including financial, regulatory, litigation, reputational and operational risks. See Item 1. Business – Regulation – Climate Change.\nFurthermore, certain organizations that provide information to investors have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to different environmental, social and governance matters, and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries. \nWe may not be able to meet the requirements, standards or expectations of our various stakeholders on environmental, social, governance and sustainability issues, including with respect to any current or future targets, goals, plans, standards or expectations (including any previously announced climate target, goal or plan) on these matters, whether established or set by us or third parties, due to a variety of factors, including regulatory or other developments, changes to the methodologies, assumptions and estimates that underlie our climate- and other sustainability-related targets, goals and strategy, or the actions of or information provided by third parties outside of our control, who may apply standards, methodologies, practices and policies that differ from ours. If we are unable to meet such targets, goals, plans, standards or expectations, it could result in adverse publicity, reputational harm, or loss of customer and/ or investor confidence, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Conversely, actions we may take toward meeting such targets, goals, plans, standards or expectations could expose us to negative investor sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, adverse publicity or reputational harm.\nFor information on the effects of climate change on our business, see Reserves and Exposures – “Climate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition” above.\nAn epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nPublic health crises and related governmental response measures, for example related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in significant societal disruption, economic uncertainty, volatility in business and consumer confidence and global economic slowdowns, which have adversely impacted our business and may again do so.\nFor example, we have experienced increased claim volumes; adverse effects resulting from our exposure to certain industries, and difficulties in arriving at accurate valuations thereof, which has caused or may cause impairment of the estimates and assumptions used to run our businesses or resulting in greater variability and subjectivity in our investment decisions; and increased difficulty and cost in obtaining reinsurance coverage.\nIf a public health crisis emerges the markets and economies in which we operate may experience heightened stress and further volatility, which may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Legal proceedings, including class actions, could also be filed against us, our insureds, or others, seeking coverage for epidemic or pandemic-related losses or alleging bad faith denial of such coverage. In addition, remote or hybrid work may negatively impact our compliance efforts, culture and employees’ morale, which could result in greater turnover, lower productivity and greater operational risks. \nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. \nEffective intellectual property rights protection, including in the form of contractual rights, copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, may be unavailable, limited, or subject to change in some countries where we do or plan to do business. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We have, and may in the future, litigate to protect our intellectual property. Any such litigation may be costly and may not be successful. Additionally, third parties may have patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services or which could limit our ability to offer certain product features. Consequently, we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property litigation could prove to be both costly and unsuccessful, result in significant expense, damages, and in some circumstances, we could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties to resolve infringement or contractual disputes. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or protect our intellectual property assets could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.\nREGULATION \nOur businesses are heavily regulated and changes in laws and regulations may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability.\nOur operations generally, and our insurance subsidiaries in particular, are subject to extensive and potentially conflicting laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our business and financial condition are also subject to supervision and regulation by authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Federal, state and foreign regulators also periodically review and investigate our insurance businesses, including Company-specific and industry-wide practices. The primary purpose of insurance regulation is the protection of insurance and reinsurance contract holders. The extent of regulation on our insurance business varies across the jurisdictions in which we operate, but generally is governed by laws that delegate regulatory, supervisory and \n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nadministrative authority to insurance departments and similar regulatory agencies. The laws and regulations that apply to our business and operations generally grant regulatory agencies and/or self-regulatory organizations broad rulemaking and enforcement powers, including the power to regulate the issuance, marketing, sale and distribution of our products, the manner in which we underwrite our policies, the delivery of our services, the nature or extent of disclosures that we give our customers, the compensation of our distribution partners, the manner in which we handle claims on our policies and the administration of our policies and contracts, as well as the power to limit or restrict our business for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. \nWe strive to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, operations and legal entities, including maintenance of all required licenses and approvals. The application of and compliance with such laws and regulations may be subject to interpretation, evolving industry practices and regulatory expectations that could result in increased compliance costs. The relevant authorities may not agree with our interpretation of these laws and regulations or with our policies and procedures adopted to address evolving industry practices or meet regulatory expectations. Such authorities’ interpretations and views may also change from time to time. It is also possible that the laws, regulations and interpretations across various jurisdictions in which we do business may conflict with one another, or affect how we do business beyond such jurisdictions’ borders, including in the United States and/or globally. If we are found not to have complied with applicable legal or regulatory requirements, these authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities, impose substantial administrative penalties such as fines or require corrective actions, which individually or in the aggregate could interrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, in instances where such authorities’ interpretation of new or revised requirements related to capital, accounting treatment, valuation or reserving has materially differed, or may in the future materially differ from ours, we have incurred, and may again incur, higher operating costs, and sales of products subject to such requirements or treatment have been and may again be affected.\nRegulators in jurisdictions in which we do business have adopted RBC, solvency and liquidity standards applicable to insurers operating in their jurisdiction. Failure to comply with such capital (including, in the U.S., RBC), solvency, liquidity and similar requirements, or as otherwise may be agreed by us or one of our insurance company subsidiaries with an insurance regulator, would generally permit the insurance regulator to take certain regulatory actions that could materially impact the affected company’s operations. Those actions range from requiring an insurer to submit a plan describing how it would regain a specified RBC or solvency ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. The NAIC has adopted methodologies for assessing group-wide regulatory capital, which could evolve into more formal group-wide prescribed capital requirements on certain insurance companies and/or their holding companies that may augment jurisdictional RBC or solvency standards that apply at the legal entity level, and the basis for such capital calculations may differ, in whole or in part, from the statutory statements of our insurance subsidiaries used to calculate RBC. Furthermore, efforts to address systemic risks within the financial services industry, including insurance services, may lead regulators to apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that we and other insurers or other nonbank financial services companies engage in. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has authority under Dodd-Frank to determine that certain nonbank financial companies, including insurers, be designated as nonbank SIFIs subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and enhanced prudential standards, and has in place guidance and procedures intended to govern any such designations. We cannot predict the effect that any such initiatives or heightened standards may have on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nThere has also been increased regulatory scrutiny of the use of data, machine learning, predictive models and artificial intelligence, including in the insurance industry. Certain insurance regulators have developed, and others are developing, regulations or guidance applicable to insurance companies that use artificial intelligence, data analytics, machine learning and predictive models in their operations. We cannot predict the impact of the regulatory actions that have been or may in the future be taken with regard to data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning or predictive models, but any limitations or restrictions could have a material impact on our business, processes, results of operations and financial condition. \nWe also cannot predict the impact that laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions may have on our businesses, results of operations or cash flows, or on the financial markets generally. It is possible such laws, regulations or standards, including, without limitation, Solvency II and European Data Protection Board Cross Border Data Transfer, Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) in the EU, and standard-setting initiatives by the FSB and the IAIS, including, but not limited to, the IAIS’ Common Framework for the Supervision of IAIGs, its global Insurance Capital Standard, which was recently adopted as a group-level prescribed capital requirement, and its holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk, may significantly alter our business practices. For example, regulators have imposed and may continue to impose new requirements, and regulators and other international organizations may continue to issue guidance, aimed at addressing or mitigating climate change-related risks. They may also limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. It is also possible that the laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions will differ from one another, and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United States.\nFor additional information on our regulatory environment, see Item 1. Business – Regulation.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nFor information regarding the effects of regulations related to climate change on our business, see Reserves and Exposures – “Climate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition” above.\nFor information regarding the regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Business and Operations – “An epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity” above.\nNew laws and regulations or new interpretations of current laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, may affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively. \nLegislators, regulators, self-regulatory and other organizations have in the past, and may in the future, periodically consider various proposals that, if enacted, may affect or restrict, among other things, our business practices and activities, product designs and distribution relationships, how we market, sell or service certain products we offer, the investment assets we hold and our investment management practices, our capital, reserving and accounting requirements, or the profitability of certain of our businesses.\nFurther, new laws, regulations or guidance may affect or significantly limit our ability to conduct certain businesses at all, including restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage. Changes in legislation or regulation could also impose additional taxes on a limited subset of financial institutions and insurance companies (either based on size, activities, geography or other criteria), limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. It is uncertain whether and how these and other changes in legislation or regulation would apply to us, those who sell or service our products, or our competitors or how they could impact our ability to compete effectively, as well as our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nAn “ownership change” could limit our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income. \nOur ability to use U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of AIG Parent's ownership (measured by value) by one or more “5-percent shareholders” (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its utilization of pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the Internal Revenue Service (AFR) (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards arising from an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code would be dependent on the value of our equity and the AFR at the time of any ownership change. If we were to experience an “ownership change,” it is possible that a significant portion of our tax loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income.\nNew and proposed changes to tax laws could increase our corporate taxes. \nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income for corporations with average profits over $1 billion over a three-year period. While the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations for CAMT during the third quarter of 2024, there are still certain details regarding the application of the CAMT that remain unclear and we continue to evaluate the impact of the proposed regulations along with any other guidance. \nNew tax laws outside the U.S., in particular those enacted in response to proposals by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, could make substantive changes to the global international tax regime. Such changes could increase our global tax costs. We continue to monitor and assess the impact of such proposals.\nFinally, it is possible that tax laws will be further changed either in a technical corrections bill or entirely new legislation. It remains difficult to predict whether or when there will be any tax law changes or further guidance by the authorities in the U.S. or elsewhere in the world. New or proposed changes to tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as the impact of proposals on our business can vary substantially depending upon the specific changes or further guidance made and how the changes or guidance are implemented by the authorities.\nFor additional information, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nEstimates or assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements and modeled results used in various areas of our business may differ materially from actual experience.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. The accounting policies that we consider most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore may be viewed as critical accounting estimates, are described in Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Critical Accounting Estimates and in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. These estimates are based on judgment, current facts and circumstances, and, when applicable, models developed internally or with inputs from third parties. Therefore, actual results may differ from these estimates and models, possibly in the near term, and could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nIn addition, we employ models to price products, calculate reserves and value assets and execute hedging strategies, as well as to assess risk and determine statutory capital requirements, among other uses. These models are complex and rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain, may use incomplete, outdated or incorrect data or assumptions and may not operate as intended. To the extent that any of our operating practices and procedures do not accurately produce, or reproduce, data that we use to conduct any or all aspects of our business, such differences may negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, if any of our modeling practices do not accurately produce, or reproduce, data that we use to conduct any or all aspects of our business, such errors may negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements may impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which are periodically revised. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The adoption of new or revised accounting standards has in the past, and may in the future impact, our reported consolidated results of operations, liquidity and reported financial condition and may cause investors to perceive greater volatility in our financial results, negatively impacting our level of investor interest and investment.\nFor information regarding the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet required to be implemented, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf our businesses do not perform well and/or their estimated fair values decline, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or establish an additional valuation allowance against the related deferred income tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \nGoodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment and conduct interim qualitative assessments on a periodic basis. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the “reporting unit” to which the goodwill relates. In 2024, for substantially all of the reporting units we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. If it is determined that goodwill has been impaired, we must write down goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). These write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on goodwill impairment, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Critical Accounting Estimates – Goodwill Impairment and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. If, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income, which such action we have taken from time to time. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on deferred tax assets, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A – Critical Accounting Estimates – Income Taxes and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K    \nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\nEMPLOYEES AND COMPETITION\nEmployee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in reputational damage and significant losses. \nWe are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or misconduct could occur despite extensive training for employees and fraud monitoring. Instances of fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, misuse of customer or proprietary/confidential information, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies may result in losses and/or reputational damage.\nCompetition for employees in our industry is intense, and managing key employee succession is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain the key employees and other highly skilled employees we need to support our businesses. \nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key and other highly skilled employees. Due to the intense competition in our industry for key employees, we may be unable to retain or hire such employees. In addition, we may experience higher than expected employee turnover and difficulty attracting new employees as a result of uncertainty from strategic actions and organizational and operational changes. Losing any of our key employees also could have a material adverse effect on our operations given their skills, knowledge of our business, years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements. Our business and consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in retaining and attracting key employees.\nIn addition, we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our Chief Executive Officer, other members of senior management and other key employees. While we have long-term compensation plans designed to retain our employees and succession plans, our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us and our succession plans may not operate effectively.\nWe face intense competition in each of our business lines, and technological changes may present new and intensified challenges to our businesses.\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Our principal competitors are other property and casualty insurance organizations.\nWe compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, and terms and conditions. Reductions of our credit ratings or IFS ratings or negative publicity may make it more difficult to compete to retain existing customers and to maintain our historical levels of business with existing customers, counterparties and distribution relationships. A decline in our position as to any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability.\nTechnological advancements and innovation in the insurance industry, including those related to evolving customer preferences, the digitization of insurance products and services, data ingestion and exchange with trading partners, acceleration of automated underwriting, and use of artificial intelligence and electronic processes present competitive risks. Technological advancements and innovation are occurring in distribution, underwriting, recordkeeping, advisory, marketing, claims and operations at a rapid pace, and that pace may increase, particularly as companies increasingly use data analytics and technology as part of their business strategy. If we are unable to effectively implement these technological advancements in our business, including the use of artificial intelligence, in a way that matches or exceeds our competitors, we may suffer competitive harm as a result, which could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. For further discussion on regulatory developments with respect to emerging technologies, see Regulation above.\nFurther, additional costs may also be incurred in order to implement changes to automate and digitize procedures critical to our distribution channels in order to increase flexibility of access to our services and products. While we seek opportunities to leverage technological advancements and innovation for our customers’ benefit, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if external technological advancements or innovation, or the regulation of technological advancements or innovation, limit our ability to retain existing business, write new business at adequate rates or on appropriate terms, or impact our ability to adapt or deploy current products as quickly and effectively as our competitors.",
