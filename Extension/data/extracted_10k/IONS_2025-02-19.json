      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\n \nFor three decades, we have invented medicines that bring better futures to people with serious diseases. As a pioneer in RNA-targeted medicines with a deep understanding of disease biology and an industry-leading drug discovery technology, we are driven to deliver innovative, life-changing advances for patients.\n \nIn the last year, we delivered on our strategy to create accelerating value for all our stakeholders. With our commercial launch of TRYNGOLZA (olezarsen) in the United States, or U.S., following its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, we began a new chapter as a fully integrated commercial-stage biotechnology company. We currently have six marketed medicines to treat serious diseases: TRYNGOLZA, WAINUA (eplontersen), SPINRAZA (nusinersen), QALSODY (tofersen), TEGSEDI (inotersen) and WAYLIVRA (volanesorsen).\n \nMarketed Medicines\n \n \n•                                                               TRYNGOLZA is approved in the U.S. as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglycerides in adults with familial chylomicronemia                                                            \n    syndrome, or FCS. TRYNGOLZA is the first-ever FDA-approved treatment that significantly and substantially reduces triglyceride levels in adults with FCS and provides clinically meaningful reduction in acute pancreatitis, or AP, events when\n                                                       used with an appropriate diet (≤20 grams of fat per day). TRYNGOLZA is the first medicine we are commercializing independently in the U.S.                                                  \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•                                                               WAINUA is approved in numerous countries, including the U.S. and United Kingdom, or UK, for the treatment of the                                                           \n    polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-medicated amyloidosis, or ATTRv-PN, in adults. WAINUA is the only approved medicine for the treatment of ATTRv-PN that can be self-administered via an auto-injector. We and AstraZeneca are\n                                              co-developing WAINUA globally and co-commercializing WAINUA in the U.S. AstraZeneca has exclusive rights to commercialize WAINUA outside of the U.S.                                         \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•   SPINRAZA is a global market leader for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA. Our\n                               partner, Biogen, is responsible for commercializing SPINRAZA worldwide.                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•                                                            QALSODY is approved in the U.S., European Union, or EU, China and Japan for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or                                                         \n    ALS, in adults who have a mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, gene, or SOD1-ALS. QALSODY received accelerated approval from the FDA and marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances from the European Medicines Agency,\n                                             or EMA. QALSODY was the first treatment approved to target a genetic cause of ALS. Our partner, Biogen, is responsible for commercializing QALSODY worldwide.                                          \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•                                                         TEGSEDI is approved in the EU, Canada and Brazil for the treatment of ATTRv-PN in adults. We currently sell TEGSEDI in Europe                                                      \n    through our distribution agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, or Sobi. We and Sobi terminated our agreement for TEGSEDI in North America, after which we discontinued TEGSEDI in North America. In Latin America, PTC Therapeutics\n                                International Limited, or PTC, is commercializing TEGSEDI in Brazil and is pursuing access in additional Latin American countries through its exclusive license agreement with us.                           \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n•                                                                                            WAYLIVRA is approved in the EU and Brazil as an adjunct to                                                                                         \n      diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for acute, potentially fatal pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.

In Latin America, PTC is commercializing WAYLIVRA in Brazil for two indications, FCS and familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL, and is pursuing access in additional Latin American countries through its\n                                                                                                        exclusive license agreement with us.                                                                                                    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn addition to our currently marketed medicines, we are also positioned to deliver multiple products to the market independently in the next three years. Donidalorsen for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, or HAE, is currently under regulatory review in the U.S., positioning us for our second independent commercial launch in 2025. We also have a rich innovative late- and mid-stage pipeline across our focus areas of neurology, cardiology and select areas of high patient needs. We currently have nine medicines in Phase 3 development and multiple additional medicines in early and mid-stage development. We delivered eight positive data readouts in the last year from our late- and mid-stage pipeline, including positive data for TRYNGOLZA, donidalorsen and ION582, our medicine for people with Angelman syndrome, or AS. And we further advanced our next-generation technologies for RNA-targeted medicines, including advancing our first program using our mesyl phosphoramidate, or MsPA, backbone into clinical development.\n \n  4\n\n\n\nWe earned revenues of $705 million in 2024 and ended 2024 with a cash and short-term investment balance of $2.3 billion that enables our continued investments to support ongoing and upcoming planned launches and to advance our wholly owned medicines in development. Our key recent achievements, combined with our independent and partnered product launches anticipated over the next three years, position us well to help millions of patients with serious diseases and deliver increasing product and royalty revenue.\n \nOur Marketed Medicines – Bringing Value to Patients Today\n \nTRYNGOLZA (apoC-III) – TRYNGOLZA (olezarsen), injection is an APOC-III-directed antisense medicine indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglycerides in adults with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS. TRYNGOLZA lowers the body’s production of apolipoprotein C-III, or apoC-III, a protein produced in the liver that is a key regulator of triglyceride metabolism. TRYNGOLZA was approved by the FDA in December 2024 and is the first-ever FDA-approved treatment that significantly and substantially reduces triglyceride levels in adults with FCS and provides clinically meaningful reduction in AP events when used with an appropriate diet (≤20 grams of fat per day). TRYNGOLZA is currently under regulatory review in the EU.\n \nFCS is a rare, genetic, potentially life-threatening form of sHTG that prevents the body from breaking down fats and severely impairs the body’s ability to remove triglycerides from the bloodstream due to an impaired function of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase, or LPL. While healthy levels for adults are below 150 mg/dL, people with FCS often have triglyceride levels of more than 880 mg/dL and often have a history of pancreatitis. Those living with FCS have a high risk of potentially fatal AP, which is a painful inflammation of the pancreas, and chronic health issues such as fatigue and severe, recurrent abdominal pain. People living with FCS can also experience psychological and financial stress, which can significantly impact their quality of life. FCS is estimated to impact up to approximately 3,000 people in the U.S., the vast majority of whom remain undiagnosed.\n \nWe are also developing olezarsen to treat severe hypertriglyceridemia, or sHTG. See the “olezarsen” description under the section titled, Our Innovative Late-Stage Pipeline of Ionis-Owned Investigational Medicines, below for further information on our development program for sHTG.\n \nFDA approval was based on positive data from the placebo-controlled Phase 3 Balance study in adult patients with genetically identified FCS and fasting triglyceride levels ≥880 mg/dL. In the Balance study, TRYNGOLZA demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in triglyceride levels. TRYNGOLZA also demonstrated a substantial, clinically meaningful reduction in AP events. In addition, TRYNGOLZA demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the Balance study.\n \nTRYNGOLZA was reviewed by the FDA under Priority Review and had previously been granted Fast Track, Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy designations for the treatment of FCS.\n \nWAINUA (TTR) – WAINUA (eplontersen) injection is a transthyretin-directed antisense oligonucleotide indicated for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-medicated amyloidosis, or ATTRv-PN, in adults. WAINUA causes degradation of mutant and wild-type TTR mRNA through binding to the TTR mRNA, which results in a reduction of serum TTR protein and TTR protein deposits in tissues. WAINUA was approved in the U.S. in December 2023 and was recommended for approval by the CHMP in the EU in October 2024. WAINUA is also approved in other markets, including the UK and Canada, with additional regulatory reviews underway. We and AstraZeneca are co-commercializing WAINUA in the U.S. and AstraZeneca has exclusive rest of world commercialization rights.\n \nATTRv-PN is a debilitating disease that leads to peripheral nerve damage with motor disability within five years of diagnosis and, without treatment, is generally fatal within a decade. ATTR is caused by the accumulation of liver-derived misfolded TTR protein in tissues, such as the heart and the peripheral nerves, causing organ damage and failure. ATTR then causes complications, leading to cardiovascular, neurological and renal diseases such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease. There are both hereditary (ATTRv) and non-hereditary (wild-type) forms of ATTR. ATTR has several phenotypes including ATTR-cardiomyopathy, or ATTR-CM, which predominantly impacts the heart, potentially leading to heart failure, and ATTR-polyneuropathy, which predominantly affects the peripheral nervous system and mixed phenotype, where patients experience symptoms of both. Worldwide, there are an estimated 10,000 – 40,000 patients with ATTRv-PN. See the “Eplontersen” description under the section titled, Our Innovative Late-Stage Pipeline of Partnered Investigational Medicines, below for further information on our development program for ATTR-CM.\n  \nFDA approval was based on the interim analysis of the open-label Phase 3 NEURO-TTRansform study in patients with ATTRv-PN. The study compared WAINUA to the historical placebo arm from the TEGSEDI (inotersen) NEURO-TTR Phase 3 study. In the interim analysis, WAINUA demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful change from baseline for the co-primary endpoints of serum TTR concentration and Neuropathy Impairment Score +7, or mNIS+7. Additionally, WAINUA demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the NEURO-TTRansform study.\n \n  5\n\n\n\nThe FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to WAINUA for the treatment of ATTR.\n \nSPINRAZA (SMN) – SPINRAZA (nusinersen) injection for intrathecal use is a survival motor neuron-2, or SMN2, directed antisense medicine indicated for the treatment of SMA in pediatric and adult patients. SPINRAZA targets the root cause of SMA by increasing the production of functional survival motor neuron, or SMN, protein. SPINRAZA is a global market leader for the treatment of patients with SMA. Our partner, Biogen, is responsible for commercializing SPINRAZA worldwide.\n \nSMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem. People with SMA have a deletion or defect in their SMN1 gene and rely on their SMN2 gene to produce functional SMN protein, which motor neurons need to maintain motor function and muscle strength. However, in untreated people the SMN2 gene can only produce approximately 10% of the SMN protein critical for motor neurons, resulting in severe and progressive loss of motor function and strength. The rate and severity of degeneration varies depending on the amount of functional SMN protein a patient can produce. Type 1, or infantile-onset, SMA is the most severe form of the disease. Type 1 SMA patients produce very little SMN protein and often progress to death or permanent ventilation by the age of 2. Patients with Type 2 or Type 3, or later-onset, SMA produce more SMN protein, but also suffer from a progressive loss of muscle strength and function and a reduced life expectancy.\n \nThe approval of SPINRAZA was based on efficacy and safety data from multiple clinical studies, including two randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies, ENDEAR, in patients with infantile-onset SMA, and CHERISH, in patients with later-onset SMA as well as from SHINE, an OLE study for patients with SMA who participated in prior SPINRAZA studies. Additionally, Biogen conducted the Phase 2 NURTURE study, an open-label study investigating the benefit of SPINRAZA when administered before symptom onset in patients genetically diagnosed with SMA which showed that early and sustained treatment with SPINRAZA helped participants to maintain and/or make progressive gains in motor function with most children achieving motor milestones within age-appropriate timelines and no major motor milestones were lost. SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the studies.\n \nBiogen continues to expand the body of evidence supporting SPINRAZA’s durable efficacy and well-established safety profile to address the remaining needs of SMA patients of all ages through additional studies. These include the Phase 2/3 DEVOTE study, which evaluated a higher dose of SPINRAZA compared to the currently approved dose, the Phase 4 RESPOND study, evaluating the benefit of SPINRAZA in infants and children with a suboptimal clinical response to the gene therapy, onasemnogene abeparvovec and the Phase 3b ASCEND study evaluating the clinical outcomes and assessing the safety of a higher dose of SPINRAZA in children, teens and adults with later-onset SMA following treatment with risdiplam. The positive data generated from the DEVOTE study were the basis of the recent U.S. and EU regulatory submissions that were accepted for review for higher dose nusinersen.\n \nQALSODY (SOD1) – QALSODY (tofersen) injection for intrathecal use is an antisense medicine indicated for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS, in adults who have a mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1, or SOD1, gene, or SOD1-ALS. QALSODY inhibits the production of SOD1. QALSODY was granted accelerated approval in April 2023 based on reduction in plasma neurofilament light chain, or NfL, observed in patients treated with QALSODY. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s). In May 2024, QALSODY was also approved in the EU under exceptional circumstances. Additionally, QALSODY was recently approved in China and Japan. Our partner, Biogen, is responsible for commercializing QALSODY worldwide.\n \n SOD1-ALS is a rare, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the SOD1 gene leading to a progressive loss of motor neurons. As a result, people with SOD1-ALS experience increasing muscle weakness, loss of movement, difficulty breathing and swallowing and eventually succumb to the disease. Mutations in the SOD1 gene are responsible for approximately 2% of the estimated 168,000 people who have ALS globally (SOD1-ALS). More than 15% of people with ALS are thought to have a genetic form of the disease; however, they may not have a known family history of the disease.\n \nBiogen is also evaluating tofersen for treatment of presymptomatic individuals who have a SOD1 genetic mutation.\n\n\nThe QALSODY regulatory submissions included results from a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, a Phase 1/2 study evaluating ascending dose levels, the Phase 3 VALOR study, and the Phase 3 OLE study, as well as 12-month integrated results from the Phase 3 VALOR study and the Phase 3 open-label extension, or OLE, study. The 12-month integrated data show that earlier initiation of QALSODY, compared to delayed initiation, slowed declines in clinical function, respiratory function, muscle strength and quality of life and build on the results previously observed in the initial readout. The 12-month data compare patients with early initiation of QALSODY (at the start of VALOR) to those who had a delayed initiation of QALSODY (six months later, in the OLE). Additionally, QALSODY demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the VALOR study.\n \n  6\n\n\n\nThe FDA and EMA granted QALSODY Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of ALS.\n \nTEGSEDI (TTR) – TEGSEDI (inotersen) injection is a transthyretin-directed antisense oligonucleotide medicine indicated for the treatment of ATTRv-PN in adults. TEGSEDI prevents the production of TTR protein, reducing the amount of amyloid buildup that damages organs and tissues. We currently sell TEGSEDI in Europe through our distribution agreement with Sobi. In Latin America, PTC is commercializing TEGSEDI in Brazil and is pursuing access in additional Latin American countries through its exclusive license agreement with us.\n \nThe approvals of TEGSEDI were based on efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 NEURO-TTR study in patients with ATTRv-PN.\n \nWAYLIVRA (apoC-III) – WAYLIVRA (volanesorsen) injection is an antisense oligonucleotide medicine indicated as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for acute, potentially fatal pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. WAYLIVRA reduces triglyceride levels by inhibiting the production of apoC-III, a protein that is a key regulator of triglyceride levels. WAYLIVRA received conditional marketing authorization in May 2019 from the European Commission, or EC. We sell WAYLIVRA in Europe through our distribution agreement with Sobi. In Latin America, WAYLIVRA is approved for two indications, FCS and FPL. PTC is commercializing WAYLIVRA in Brazil and is pursuing access in additional Latin American countries through its exclusive license agreement with us.\n \nWAYLIVRA’s conditional marketing authorization in the EU for FCS and approval in Brazil for FCS were based on efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 APPROACH study and supported by results from the Phase 3 COMPASS study. WAYLIVRA’s approval in Brazil for FPL was based on efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 BROADEN study in patients with FPL.\n \nOur Innovative Late-Stage Pipeline of Ionis-Owned Investigational Medicines\n \nAs a pioneer in RNA-targeted therapeutics, we continue to drive innovation with a leading pipeline in neurology, cardiology and select diseases of high unmet need. The table below lists Ionis-owned medicines currently in late-stage development, which Ionis plans to commercialize in the U.S. independently.\n![alt  graphic](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874015/000087401525000089/image01.jpg)\n\n 1    Ionis is commercializing TRYNGOLZA (olezarsen) for the treatment of FCS in the U.S.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 2    Granted Otsuka exclusive rights to commercialize donidalorsen in Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 3    Granted Theratechnologies exclusive rights to commercialize olezarsen and donidalorsen in Canada.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOlezarsen (apoC-III) – Olezarsen is an investigational RNA-targeted medicine that we are evaluating for people with sHTG. Olezarsen is designed to lower the body’s production of apoC-III, a protein produced in the liver that regulates triglyceride metabolism in the blood. sHTG is a disease categorized by triglyceride levels of 500 mg/dL and above. It develops due to primary (genetic) and secondary causes including diet and lifestyle, other medical conditions and certain medications. More than three million people are currently estimated to live with sHTG in the U.S. People living with sHTG are at high risk of pancreatitis (a painful inflammation of the pancreas) and damage to the pancreas. As such, reducing the risk of pancreatitis is a critically important reason to treat sHTG. People with sHTG are also at risk of heart, brain and blood vessel damage.\n \n  7\n\n\n\nWe are currently conducting a broad development program for olezarsen that includes three fully enrolled Phase 3 studies supporting development for the treatment of sHTG: CORE, CORE2 and ESSENCE. Data from the ESSENCE study is expected in mid-2025 and data from the CORE and CORE2 studies are expected in the second half of 2025.\n \nWe advanced olezarsen into Phase 3 development based on the positive results from a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and at high risk of or with established cardiovascular disease, or CVD. In the Phase 2 study, olezarsen achieved statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions in fasting triglycerides compared to placebo at all dose levels. Olezarsen also achieved statistical significance in numerous key secondary endpoints, including significant reductions in apoC-III. Olezarsen demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the Phase 2 study supportive of continued development. As discussed above under “TRYNGOLZA” in the section titled, Our Marketed Medicines – Bringing Value to Patients Today, olezarsen was recently approved in the U.S. for the treatment of FCS.\n \nDonidalorsen (PKK) – Donidalorsen is an investigational RNA-targeted medicine we designed to target the production of prekallikrein, or PKK, which plays an important role in the activation of inflammatory mediators associated with acute attacks of HAE. By reducing the production of PKK, donidalorsen could be an effective prophylactic approach to preventing HAE attacks. HAE is a rare and potentially life-threatening genetic condition that involves recurrent attacks of severe swelling (angioedema) in various parts of the body, including the hands, feet, genitals, stomach, face and/or throat. HAE is estimated to affect approximately 20,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. Donidalorsen is currently under review in the U.S. and the FDA has set an action date of August 21, 2025 under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA. Donidalorsen is also under regulatory review in the EU. Otsuka has exclusive rights to commercialize donidalorsen in Europe and Asia and Theratechnologies has exclusive rights to commercialize donidalorsen in Canada.\n \nOur regulatory submissions are based on the positive data from the placebo-controlled Phase 3 OASIS-HAE study, the Phase 3 OASISplus study and the Phase 2 OLE study in patients with HAE. The OASIS-HAE study met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant reduction in the rate of HAE attacks and demonstrated clinically significant improvement in quality of life as measured by the Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire, or AE-QoL in patients treated every four weeks and patients treated every eight weeks. The OASISplus study includes an OLE cohort and a prospective cohort to assess patients switching from currently available long-term prophylactic treatments to donidalorsen. Positive results from a February 2024 data cut from the ongoing OLE cohort showed that HAE attack rates continued to improve over time and extended treatment resulted in further improved quality of life measures and high levels of disease control. In the OASISplus switch cohort, patients followed a pre-defined specific protocol to transition from their prior therapy to donidalorsen. Results showed that patients were able to switch to donidalorsen from prior prophylactic treatment without an increase in breakthrough attacks. Donidalorsen treatment also led to a further improvement in mean monthly HAE attack rates and continued improvements in measures of quality of life. A majority of patients surveyed reported a preference for donidalorsen over their previous treatment. In all of these studies, donidalorsen demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile.\n \nThe FDA and EMA granted Orphan Drug designation to donidalorsen.\n \nZilganersen (GFAP) – Zilganersen (formerly ION373) is an investigational RNA-targeted medicine we designed to inhibit the production of glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, that accumulates because of disease-causing variants in the GFAP gene. We are developing zilganersen as a potential treatment for people with genetically confirmed Alexander disease, or AxD. AxD is an ultra-rare, progressive and ultimately fatal type of leukodystrophy, which are a group of genetic disorders that affect the brain’s white matter. AxD is estimated to occur in approximately one in one million to one in three million people worldwide and usually leads to death within 14 - 25 years after symptom onset. AxD can present throughout life as loss of independence and lack of ability to control muscles for swallowing, airway protection and purposeful movements. The impact of AxD can vary depending on factors like age of onset. Diagnosing AxD is based on a combination of clinical presentation, brain magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, findings and genetic testing. There are no medicines approved for people with AxD, and current treatments focus on managing their symptoms.\n \nWe are conducting a single clinical study of zilganersen in patients with AxD designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of zilganersen. In September 2023, we advanced zilganersen into the Phase 3 portion of the study.\n \nThe FDA and EMA granted Orphan Drug designation to zilganersen. Additionally, the FDA granted Fast Track and Rare Pediatric designations to zilganersen.\n \nION582 (UBE3A) (BIIB121) – ION582 is an investigational RNA-targeted medicine we designed to inhibit the expression of the UBE3A antisense transcript, or UBE3A-ATS, and increase production of UBE3A protein, for the potential treatment of AS. AS is a rare, genetic neurological disease caused by the loss of function of the maternally inherited UBE3A gene. AS typically presents in infancy and is characterized by intellectual disability, balance issues, motor impairment, and debilitating seizures. Some patients are unable to walk or speak. Some symptoms can be managed with existing drugs; however, there are no approved disease modifying therapies.\n \n  8\n\n\n\nWe are conducting the ongoing open label Phase 1/2 study, HALOS, of ION582 in patients with AS designed to assess the safety, tolerability and activity of multiple ascending doses of ION582 administered intrathecally. In 2024, we presented positive results from the completed multiple ascending dose, or MAD, portion of the study in people with AS demonstrating consistent and encouraging clinical improvement on measures assessing all functional domains including communication, cognition and motor function. ION582 showed favorable safety and tolerability at all dose levels in the study.\n \nBased on the positive results from the HALOS study and alignment with the FDA, we plan to advance ION582 into Phase 3 development in the first half of 2025. The planned placebo-controlled Phase 3 study will enroll children and adults with AS who have a maternal UBE3A gene deletion or mutation to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ION582.\n \nThe FDA and EMA granted Orphan Drug designation to ION582. Additionally, the FDA granted Fast Track and Rare Pediatric designations to ION582.\n \nOur Innovative Late-Stage Pipeline of Partnered Investigational Medicines\n \nIn addition to our Ionis-owned investigational medicines, we also have numerous potentially transformational partnered medicines in clinical development. The table below lists our partnered medicines in late-stage development. For further information on our collaboration agreements, refer to the section titled, Collaborative Arrangements![alt  graphic](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874015/000087401525000089/image03.jpg)\n.\n \n \nEplontersen (TTR) – Eplontersen is an investigational RNA-targeted medicine designed to degrade mutant and wild-type TTR mRNA through binding to the TTR mRNA, which results in a reduction of serum TTR protein and TTR protein deposits in tissues. Eplontersen is currently being evaluated in patients with hereditary or wild-type transthyretin-mediated amyloid cardiomyopathy, or ATTR-CM. ATTR-CM is a progressive and fatal disease caused by the accumulation of misfolded TTR protein in the cardiac muscle. Patients experience ongoing debilitating heart damage resulting in progressive heart failure, which results in death within two to six years from disease onset. Worldwide, there are an estimated 300,000 – 500,000 patients with ATTR-CM. We and AstraZeneca are co-developing eplontersen globally and co-commercializing eplontersen in the U.S. AstraZeneca has exclusive rest-of-world commercialization rights.\n \nWe are conducting the ongoing placebo-controlled CARDIO-TTRansform Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study of eplontersen in patients with ATTR-CM. We designed the study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of eplontersen in patients with ATTR-CM.\n \nAs discussed above under “WAINUA” in the section titled, Our Marketed Medicines – Bringing Value to Patients Today, eplontersen is approved in numerous countries, including the U.S. and UK, for the treatment of the ATTRv-PN.\n \nThe FDA granted Orphan Drug designation to WAINUA for the treatment of ATTR. The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to eplontersen for ATTR-CM.\n \n  9\n\n\n\nPelacarsen (Apo(a)) (TQJ230) – Pelacarsen is an investigational RNA-targeted medicine we designed to inhibit the production of apolipoprotein(a), or Apo(a), in the liver to offer a direct approach for reducing lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a). Elevated Lp(a) is recognized as an independent, genetic cause of CVD. Lp(a) levels are determined at birth and lifestyle modification, including diet and exercise, do not impact Lp(a) levels. Inhibiting the production of Apo(a) in the liver reduces the level of Lp(a) in blood, potentially slowing down or reversing CVD in people with hyperlipoproteinemia(a), a condition in which individuals have levels of Lp(a) greater than 50 mg/dL, the recognized threshold for risk of CVD. We believe antisense technology is well suited to address hyperlipoproteinemia(a) because it specifically targets the RNA that codes for all forms of the Apo(a) molecule. It is estimated that there are more than eight million people living with CVD and elevated levels of Lp(a). Our partner, Novartis, is responsible for ongoing development and commercialization of pelacarsen worldwide.\n \nNovartis is conducting the placebo-controlled Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study of pelacarsen, Lp(a)HORIZON, to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of pelacarsen in patients with elevated Lp(a) levels and established or at risk for CVD.\n \nIn November 2018, at the American Heart Association annual meeting, we reported results of the Phase 2 study of pelacarsen in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia(a). In the Phase 2 study, we observed statistically significant and dose dependent reductions from baseline in Lp(a) levels. Additionally, pelacarsen demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the study.\n \nThe FDA and Center for Drug Evaluation of China National Medical Products Administration granted pelacarsen Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy, respectively, for the treatment of patients with elevated Lp(a) and established CVD.\n \nBepirovirsen (HBV) (GSK3228836) – Bepirovirsen is an investigational RNA-targeted medicine we designed to inhibit the production of viral proteins associated with hepatitis B virus, or HBV. These include proteins associated with infection and replication, including the hepatitis B surface antigen, or HBsAg, which is present in both acute and chronic infections and is associated with a poor prognosis in people with chronic HBV infection. HBV infection is a serious health problem that can lead to significant and potentially fatal health conditions, including cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. Chronic HBV infection is one of the most common persistent viral infections in the world, affecting more than 250 million people and resulting in more than 1 million deaths annually. Currently available therapies, although effective in reducing circulating HBV in the blood, do not effectively inhibit HBV antigen production and secretion, which are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of liver cancer. Our partner, GSK, is responsible for ongoing development and commercialization of bepirovirsen worldwide.\n \nGSK is conducting the placebo-controlled Phase 3 program of bepirovirsen, B-Well, in patients with chronic HBV designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of bepirovirsen.\n \nIn June 2022, GSK presented positive results from the Phase 2b B-Clear study of bepirovirsen in patients with chronic HBV infection. The end of study results showed that treatment with bepirovirsen in some patients resulted in sustained clearance of HBsAg and HBV DNA for 24 weeks after end of bepirovirsen treatment in people with chronic HBV infection. Additionally in June 2023, GSK presented durable response data from the Phase 2 B-Sure long-term follow-up study of bepirovirsen in complete responder patients from the Phase 2b B-Clear study of patients with HBV. And in October 2023, GSK reported positive data from the B-Together Phase 2b study of bepirovirsen in patients with chronic HBV infection following sequential treatment with pegylated interferon. Bepirovirsen demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in these studies.\n \nThe FDA and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, or MHLW, granted bepirovirsen Fast Track designation and SENKU (formerly known as SAKIGAKE) designation, respectively, for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection.\n \nSefaxersen (IgAN) (RO7434656) – Sefaxersen (formerly IONIS-FB-LRx) is an investigational RNA-targeted medicine we designed to reduce the production of complement factor B, or FB, and to lower activation of the alternative complement pathway. Genetic association studies have shown that overaction of the alternative complement pathway has been associated with the development of several complement-mediated diseases, including immunoglobulin A nephropathy, or IgAN. IgAN is one of the most common causes of inflammation that impairs the filtering ability of kidneys and is an important cause of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. Also known as Berger’s disease, IgAN is characterized by deposits of IgA in the kidneys, resulting in inflammation and tissue damage. Our partner, Roche, is responsible for ongoing development and commercialization of sefaxersen worldwide.\n \nIn April 2023, Roche initiated a placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of sefaxersen, called IMAGINATION, in patients with IgAN designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sefaxersen.\n \nWe reported positive results from a Phase 2 open-label study of sefaxersen in patients with IgAN, demonstrating robust and sustained reductions in complement FB and other key measures of the alternative complement pathway. Sefaxersen treatment also resulted in sustained reductions in proteinuria with patients maintaining kidney function, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, during six months of treatment. Sefaxersen demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the study.\n \n  10\n\n\n\nUlefnersen (FUS) – Ulefnersen is an investigational RNA-targeted medicine we designed to reduce the production of the fused in sarcoma, or FUS, protein to treat people with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, caused by mutations in the FUS gene. Because antisense-mediated reduction of mutant FUS protein in a FUS-ALS mouse model demonstrated the ability to prevent motor neuron loss, it is hypothesized that reduction of FUS protein will reverse or prevent disease progression in FUS-ALS patients. FUS-ALS is a rare, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by muscle weakness, loss of movement, and difficulty breathing and swallowing, resulting in a severely declining quality of life and eventually death. Current treatment options are extremely limited, with no medicines that significantly slow disease progression. Our partner, Otsuka, is responsible for global regulatory and commercialization activities, and costs for ulefnersen.\n \nIn April 2021, we initiated a Phase 3 study of ulefnersen in patients with FUS-ALS designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ulefnersen.\n \nThe FDA and EMA granted Orphan Drug designation to ulefnersen.\n \nOur Innovative Mid-Stage Pipeline of Investigational Medicines\n \nWe also have a rich mid-stage pipeline with numerous potentially transformational investigational medicines, including both Ionis-owned and partnered therapies. The table below lists our medicines in mid-stage development. For further information on our collaboration agreements, refer to the section titled, Collaborative Arrangements![alt  graphic](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/874015/000087401525000089/image04.jpg)\n.\n \n \nOur Technology\n \nFor three decades through our innovations in science and technology, we have enhanced the profiles of RNA-targeted medicines in addition to advancing new approaches in genetic medicine. Our recent technology advancements have enabled us to advance programs with the potential for extended dosing and delivery to new tissues, such as muscle. We have also added capabilities to utilize small interfering RNA, or siRNA, and potentially gene editing in addition to our novel antisense technology, which gives us the potential to deliver medicines to a greater number of people living with serious diseases.\n \n  11\n\n\n\nOverview of Ionis’ Technology\n \nAll of the medicines currently in our clinical pipeline use our antisense technology — an innovative platform for discovering first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines. Antisense medicines target RNA, the intermediary that conveys genetic information from a gene to the protein synthesis machinery in the cell. By targeting RNA instead of proteins, we can use antisense technology to increase, decrease or alter the production of specific proteins. Most of our antisense medicines are designed to bind to mRNAs and inhibit the production of disease-causing proteins. Examples of these include WAINUA, TRYNGOLZA and donidalorsen. SPINRAZA is an example of an antisense medicine that modulates RNA splicing to increase protein production of the SMN protein, which is critical to the health and survival of nerve cells in the spinal cord that are responsible for neuro-muscular function. The SMN protein is deficient in people with SMA. Our antisense technology is also broadly applicable additional antisense mechanisms including decreasing toxic RNAs.\n \nWe also now use siRNA technology, in addition to antisense technology to develop new medicines. Like antisense, siRNA medicines target RNA, and can decrease the production of specific proteins involved in disease. For each program we work on, we choose the approach that demonstrates the best potential product profile for the indication we are pursuing.\n \nOur advanced LIgand-Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology is a chemical technology we developed that involves attaching a molecule called a ligand that binds with receptors on the surface of cells in a highly specific manner. Because these receptors are often found only on certain cell types, LICA allows us to increase effective delivery of our antisense medicines with higher specificity to certain cell types that express these receptors relative to non-conjugated antisense medicines. We currently have an integrated assessment of data from multiple LICA medicines and clinical programs that demonstrates that our LICA technology for liver targets can increase potency by 20-30-fold over our non-LICA antisense medicines. Our LICA medicines have also demonstrated consistently favorable safety and tolerability in clinical trials, including in our Phase 3 studies of WAINUA (for ATTRv-PN), TRYNGOLZA (for FCS patients) and donidalorsen (for HAE).\n \nEmerging Technology Advancements\n \nOur recent technology advancements have enabled us to create even more potent medicines amenable to new potential targets and tissue types. We have also diversified the approaches we can use in designing our medicines to reach more patients with severe diseases. Today our medicines and those entering our pipeline utilize our key technology advances, including Bicycle technology, siRNA technology and MsPA backbone chemistry. And through our Metagenomi collaboration, we added the potential to use gene editing, which modifies DNA.\nMesyl phosphoramidate Backbone Chemistry\n \nWe designed our MsPA backbone chemistry to improve both therapeutic index and durability. It does this by increasing metabolic stability relative to the other backbone chemistries we utilize. We have also shown it can improve potency in certain circumstances and reduce non-specific interactions with proteins that can cause undesirable effects, such as proinflammatory effects. We currently have multiple new programs using our MsPA backbone in preclinical development.\nBicycle Collaboration\n \nIn 2021, we entered into a collaboration with Bicycle Therapeutics that we expect can expand our LICA platform to target both skeletal and cardiac muscle, and potentially deliver medicines across the blood brain barrier. Bicycles are small, bicyclic peptides that have high affinity and selectivity for protein targets. Our collaboration with Bicycle allows us to utilize Bicycles that bind transferrin receptor 1 to facilitate the tissue specific delivery of oligonucleotide drugs (both antisense and siRNAs). We advanced our first program that utilizes Bicycle technology into preclinical development in 2023.\nGene Editing and Metagenomi Collaboration\n \nIn 2022, we entered into a collaboration with Metagenomi that leverages our extensive expertise in RNA-targeted therapeutics and Metagenomi’s next-generation gene editing systems to pursue a mix of validated and novel genetic targets with the goal of discovering and developing new drugs. These targets have the potential to expand therapeutic options for patients.\n \nGene editing utilizes specific RNA-guided nucleases known as Cas enzymes to precisely and permanently modify a DNA sequence. Because of this, gene editing holds the promise of treatments that could provide long-term, potentially permanent, therapeutic benefits.\n \n  12\n\n\n\nGene editing is highly complementary and synergistic with RNA-targeted therapeutics. Both platforms rely on the same nucleic acid hybridization principals to precisely target nucleases to either RNA, in the case of RNase H and siRNA drugs, or to DNA in the case of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, or CRISPR-Cas systems. This enables us to leverage our expertise in nucleic acids and modified nucleic acid chemistry with the goal to enhance gene editing’s ability to treat diseases for which there are limited treatment options.\n \nCollaborative Arrangements\n \n We have established alliances with a number of leading global pharmaceutical companies. Our partners include the following companies, among others: AstraZeneca, Biogen, GSK, Novartis, Otsuka and Roche.

In turn, Alnylam nonexclusively licensed to us its patent estate relating to antisense motifs and mechanisms and oligonucleotide chemistry to research, develop and commercialize single-stranded antisense therapeutics, ssRNAi therapeutics, and to research double-stranded RNAi compounds. We also received a license to develop and commercialize double-stranded RNAi therapeutics targeting a limited number of therapeutic targets on a nonexclusive basis. Additionally, in 2015, we and Alnylam entered into an alliance in which we cross-licensed intellectual property. Under this alliance, we and Alnylam each obtained exclusive license rights to four therapeutic programs. Alnylam granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to its chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against four targets, including FXI and Apo(a) and two other targets. In exchange, we granted Alnylam an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to our chemistry, RNA targeting mechanism and target-specific intellectual property for oligonucleotides against four other targets. Alnylam also granted us a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to new platform technology arising from May 2014 through April 2019 for single-stranded antisense therapeutics. In turn, we granted Alnylam a royalty-bearing, non-exclusive license to new platform technology arising from May 2014 through April 2019 for double-stranded RNAi therapeutics.\nManufacturing\n \nWe manufacture most of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, we use for our research and development, or R&D, activities ourselves. We have also manufactured API and commercial supply for our approved medicines. We have dedicated significant resources to develop ways to improve manufacturing efficiency and capacity. Since we can use variants of the same nucleotide building blocks and the same type of equipment to produce our oligonucleotide medicines, we found that the same techniques we used to efficiently manufacture one oligonucleotide medicine could help improve the manufacturing processes for our other medicines. By developing several proprietary chemical processes to scale up our manufacturing capabilities, we have greatly reduced the cost of producing oligonucleotide medicines. For example, we have significantly reduced the cost of raw materials through improved yield efficiency, while at the same time increasing our capacity to make our medicines. Through both our internal research and development programs and collaborations with outside vendors, we may achieve even greater efficiency and further cost reductions.\n \n  17\n\n\n\nOur manufacturing facility is located in a 26,800 square foot building in Carlsbad, California. We purchased this building in 2017. In addition, we have a 25,800 square foot building that houses support functions for our manufacturing activities. We lease this facility under a lease that has a term ending in August 2026 with an option to extend the lease for an additional five-year period. Our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and foreign equivalents to ensure that it is operating in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements.\n \nAs part of our collaborations, we may agree to manufacture clinical trial material and/or commercial drug supply for our partners. For example, in the past we have manufactured clinical trial material for AstraZeneca, Biogen, GSK, Roche, and Novartis and commercial drug supply for Biogen.\n \nWe believe we have sufficient manufacturing capacity at our own facility or at contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to meet our current internal research, development and potential commercial needs, as well as our obligations under existing agreements with our partners for research, development and commercial material. We and/or our CMOs manufacture process performance qualification batches and pre-approval inspection batches of our Phase 3 medicines that may be used for regulatory submissions and, pending regulatory approval, commercial sale. We believe our current network of CMOs are capable of providing sufficient quantities to meet anticipated commercial demands. Additionally, we continue to evaluate relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity and diversify our supply chain. We plan to leverage our relationships with CMOs to maintain long-term supply at competitive prices in the future. While we believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our commercial requirements, it is possible that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, could result in significant delay or material additional costs. We also could experience a disruption in supply from our current CMOs.\n \nCMOs are subject to the FDA’s cGMP requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our CMOs for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards.\n \nSpecifically, we have the following in place for our commercial medicines and our late-stage medicines.\n \nTRYNGOLZA/Olezarsen\n \nFor TRYNGOLZA’s commercial drug supply, we are using CMOs to produce API and finished goods.  For the ongoing olezarsen clinical studies, we and/or our CMOs have supplied the API and the finished drug product. We intend to leverage our relationships with CMOs to meet and maintain long-term commercial supply at competitive prices in the future. We plan to accomplish this through a combination of maintaining adequate levels of safety stock and increasing the batch sizes to support future indications.\n \nWAINUA/Eplontersen\n \nAstraZeneca is responsible for WAINUA’s commercial drug supply. Our CMOs supplied the API and the finished drug product for WAINUA’s Phase 3 program. Pursuant to our collaboration with AstraZeneca, we will supply WAINUA using CMOs for the ongoing clinical trials.\n \nSPINRAZA\n \nBiogen is responsible for SPINRAZA drug supply.\n \nQALSODY\n \nBiogen is responsible for QALSODY drug supply.\n \nTEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA\n \nFor TEGSEDI’s commercial drug supply, we are using CMOs to produce API and finished goods for ourselves, Sobi and PTC. For WAYLIVRA’s commercial drug supply, we are using API that we have manufactured and CMOs to produce the finished goods.\nDonidalorsen, Zilganersen, Ulefnersen\n \nWe and/or our CMOs have supplied the API and the finished drug product for donidalorsen, zilganersen and ulefnersen that we believe will be sufficient through the completion of the Phase 3 programs for each medicine, including process performance qualification batches.\n \n  18\n\n\n\nION582\n \nWe supplied API and drug product for the ION582 Phase 1 and Phase 2 programs and will continue to supply drug for further clinical programs.\n \nPelacarsen\n \nWe supplied API and finished drug product for pelacarsen’s Phase 3 program. Pursuant to our collaboration with Novartis, Novartis is responsible for any further pelacarsen drug supply.\nBepirovirsen\n \nWe supplied API for bepirovirsen’s Phase 1 and Phase 2 programs. Pursuant to our collaboration with GSK, GSK is responsible for any further bepirovirsen drug supply.\n \nSefaxersen (IONIS-FB-LRx)\n \nWe supplied API for the sefaxersen Phase 1 and Phase 2 IgAN programs. Pursuant to our collaboration with Roche, Roche is responsible for any further drug supply for sefaxersen.\nCommercial Operations\n \nWe have established sales and marketing capabilities to support our commercial launch of WAINUA and TRYNGOLZA in the U.S. and anticipated near-term commercial launch of donidalorsen. We began with our co-commercialization partnership with AstraZeneca for WAINUA in which we combine our experience in RNA-targeted therapeutics and deep knowledge of the TTR amyloidosis market with AstraZeneca’s global scale in drug development and commercialization to enable market penetration for the benefit of patients.\n \nWith our first independent commercial launch of TRYNGOLZA underway, we have entered a new chapter as a fully integrated commercial-stage biotechnology company. We have been refining our portfolio strategy and recruiting experienced professionals with relevant backgrounds in sales, marketing, patient education, market access, portfolio planning and market insight, new product commercial strategy and commercial operations in the pharmaceutical industry. We are focused on developing a unique and innovative approach to bring our medicines to patients living with serious diseases. We have built core capabilities and a commercial platform with the ability to scale as needed to meet our current and future commercialization needs. In addition, we established our TRYNGOLZA field sales team during 2024 and plan to build additional field teams as we approach each of our launches.\n \nMedical Affairs\n \nWe have built medical affairs capabilities to disseminate information about our medicines and increase disease awareness through various channels of communication with key stakeholders. Our medical affairs function is responsible for funding and coordinating investigator-sponsored trials, communicating scientific and clinical information to healthcare providers, medical professionals and patients, and managing publications.\nIntellectual Proprietary Rights\n \nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and proprietary know-how to develop and maintain a competitive position in RNA-targeted therapeutics generally and to protect our investment in specific products. To this end, we focus our resources on intellectual property, or IP, that drives value for our company.\n \nProduct-Specific IP\n \nEach of our medicines is protected worldwide by product-specific patents claiming oligonucleotides having the nucleobase sequences and chemical modifications of our medicines; and methods of achieving cellular or clinical endpoints using such oligonucleotides. We pursue such patents in significant markets and/or countries for each medicine in development. We also seek to maximize patent term. In some cases, the patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review. Expiration dates listed below do not reflect any such extensions.\n \nCommercial products are also protected by trademarks filed throughout the world.\n \n  19\n\n\n\nMarketed Products\n \nTRYNGOLZA/Olezarsen and ApoC-III\n \nWe believe TRYNGOLZA (olezarsen) is protected from generic competition in the U.S. and Europe until at least 2034.

The following patents are some examples of our issued patents in this category:\n \n\n Jurisdiction         Patent No.                      Title                            Expiration                                                                 Description of Claims                                                               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnited States          9,127,276   CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE              2034   Preferred THA LICA conjugated to any group of nucleosides, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides\nUnited States          9,181,549   CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE              2034   Preferred THA conjugate having our preferred linker and cleavable moiety conjugated to any oligomeric compound or any nucleoside having a 2’-MOE  \n                                                                                                    modification or a cEt modification                                                                                                                \nEurope          2991661            CONJUGATED ANTISENSE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE              2034   Preferred THA LICA conjugated to any group of nucleosides, including gapmers, double-stranded siRNA compounds, and fully modified oligonucleotides\nManufacturing\n \nWe also own patents claiming methods of manufacturing and purifying oligonucleotides and related compounds. These patents claim methods for improving oligonucleotide drug manufacturing, including processes for large-scale oligonucleotide synthesis and purification.\nGovernment Regulation\n \nRegulation by government authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant component in the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and services. In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and relevant foreign regulatory authorities, we are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state and local regulations.\n \nExtensive regulation by the U.S. and foreign governmental authorities governs the development, manufacture and sale of our medicines. In particular, our medicines are subject to a number of approval requirements by the FDA in the U.S. under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other laws and by comparable agencies in those foreign countries in which we conduct business. The FDCA and other various federal, state and foreign statutes govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, quality, and import and export of our medicines. State, local, and other authorities also regulate pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities and procedures.\n \nOur manufacturing facility and our CMOs are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other foreign equivalents to ensure that they are operating in compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, marketing authorization for each new medicine may require a rigorous manufacturing pre-approval inspection by regulatory authorities. Post approval, there are strict regulations regarding changes to the manufacturing process, and, depending on the significance of the change, changes may require prior FDA approval. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use.\n \n  27\n\n\n\nThe FDA must approve any new medicine before a manufacturer can market it in the U.S. In order to obtain approval, we and our partners must complete clinical studies and prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA. If the FDA approves a medicine, it will issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the medicine and may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure the benefits of the medicine outweigh the potential risks. The requirements for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of our medicines. In foreign jurisdictions, the drug approval process is similarly demanding.\n \nPricing and Reimbursement\n \nFor any approved medicine, domestic and foreign sales of the medicine depend, in part, on the availability and amount of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payers, including governments and private health plans. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product, or procedures that utilize such product. Private health plans may seek to manage cost and use of our medicines by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. For example, third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Moreover, a payer’s decision to provide coverage for a medicine does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drugs can differ significantly from payer to payer. One third-party payer’s decision to cover a particular medicine does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the medicine or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.\n \nThird-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medicines and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any medicine that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our medicine. These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payers do not consider a medicine to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the medicine after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to sell such medicine at a profit.\n \nIn certain jurisdictions, governments may also regulate or influence coverage, reimbursement and/or pricing of our medicines to control cost or affect use. In the European community, governments influence the price of drugs through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those medicines to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which medicines may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits.\n \nThe marketability of any medicine for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government or third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, the focus on cost containment measures in the U.S. and other countries has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if we attain favorable coverage and reimbursement status for one or more medicines for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\n \nHealthcare Reform\n \nBoth the federal and state governments in the U.S. and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare.\n \n  28\n\n\n\nThere has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in efforts to bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medicines. For example, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, was signed into law, which includes key actions aimed at reducing the costs of prescription drugs and allows HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs covered under Medicare and establish a price cap on such drugs, known as the Maximum Fair Price. There are important exemptions to the Maximum Fair Price, including for medications that are orphan drug designated and approved for only one rare disease, and drugs with low Medicare spend as defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.  The IRA, among other things, (1) directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to negotiate, through a negotiation program, the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics that have been on the market for at least seven years covered under Medicare, or the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions began to take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program is currently subject to legal challenges. Under this program, HHS has already announced the agreed-upon prices of the first drugs that were subject to price negotiations and will announce the agreed-upon prices of additional drugs in the coming years. In response to an October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the CMS Innovation Center, which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future. Further, on December 7, 2023, the Biden administration announced an initiative to control the price of prescription drugs using march-in rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. On December 8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST, published for comment a Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights which for the first time includes the price of a product as one factor an agency can use when deciding to exercise march-in rights. While march-in rights have not previously been exercised, it is uncertain if that will continue under the new NIST framework, if such framework is finalized. Further, additional health reform measures may be implemented in the future, particularly in light of the recent U.S. presidential and congressional elections.\n \nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers.  Our future product sales may be subject to additional discounts from list price in the form of rebates and discounts provided to 340B covered entities. Changes to the 340B program or to Medicare or Medicaid programs at the federal or state level, including outcomes of ongoing litigation in our industry, may impact our product prices and rebate liability.\n \nIn addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulates the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market.\n \nOther healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include, for example, the following:\n \n\n●   The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act,\n                 which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●                     Foreign and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in the EU and UK; and the                  \n    California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, in California, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect; and\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●                                         The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of medicines, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare                                      \n    and Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other healthcare providers (such as physician assistants and\n                                                        nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.                                                    \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n  29\n\n\n\nSales and Marketing\n \nNumerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the HHS, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state and local government authorities, regulate sales, promotion and other activities following drug approval. As described above, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for drugs under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. Only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that the FDA has approved may be used in labeling. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling and that differ from those tested and that the FDA approved. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. If we do not comply with applicable FDA requirements, we may face adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, including corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA. Promotion of off-label uses of drugs can also implicate the false claims laws described below.\n \nIn the U.S., sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Despite our best efforts to comply with applicable law and regulations, due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, limited statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our drugs may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called “responsible corporate officer” doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing.\n \nGiven the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, corporate integrity agreements, and could include criminal penalties. If the government alleged, or subsequently settled or convicted us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals can bring similar actions. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. As described above, other healthcare laws that may affect our operations include HIPAA, analogous state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state authorities.\n \nSimilar rigid (and in some areas, heightened) restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of drugs in the E.U. and other countries. Even in those countries where we may not be directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our medicines, if our potential international distribution partners engage in inappropriate activity, it can have adverse implications for us.\n \nAs discussed above, both the federal and state governments in the U.S. and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare, including new models aimed to lower of cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care and initiatives to control the price of prescription drugs using march-in rights under the Bayh-Dole Act.\n \n  30\n\n\n\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\n \nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits certain individuals and entities, including us, from promising, paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, directly or indirectly, to obtain or retain business or an improper advantage. The FCPA also requires publicly traded companies to maintain accurate books and records and establish and maintain a system of internal accounting controls. If we violate the FCPA, it could result in large civil and criminal penalties as well as have an adverse effect on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. We could also face collateral consequences such as debarment and the loss of export privileges. In addition, in many other countries, the healthcare providers who conduct clinical trials or prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, any dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to regulation under the FCPA. There is no certainty that all employees and third-party business partners (including our contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors and other partners) will comply with the FCPA or local anti-bribery laws. Importantly, we do not control the actions of manufacturers and other third-party agents, although we may be liable for their actions.\nCompetition\n \nOur Business in General\n \nSome of our medicines may compete with existing therapies for market share and some of our medicines in development may compete for patients in clinical trials. In addition, there are a number of companies pursuing the development of genetic medicines and the development of pharmaceuticals utilizing these technologies. These companies include biopharmaceutical companies and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together. Our medicines are differentiated from traditional small molecule medicines by their chemistry, how they move in the body, how they act in the body, delivery technology, and formulations.\n \nOur commercial medicines and our medicines in development address numerous markets. The diseases our medicines target for which we have or may receive marketing authorization will determine our competition. For some of our medicines, an important factor may be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop medicines, complete the clinical trials and marketing authorization processes and supply commercial quantities of the medicines to the market are important competitive factors. We expect to compete with products approved for sale based on a variety of factors, including, among other things, product efficacy, safety, mechanism of action, dosing administration, marketing and sales strategy and tactics, availability, price, and reimbursement.\n \nBelow we have included what we believe to be medicines that compete or may compete directly with our marketed medicines and late-stage medicines. We included competitors and potential competitors that are past Phase 1 development.\n \nMarketed Medicines\n \nTRYNGOLZA/Olezarsen and WAYLIVRA\n \nWe believe that the following medicines could

We recognize the importance of Corporate Responsibility, or CR, and Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, initiatives as it relates to our business strategy and risk assessment. We continue to evolve our CR program and established three strategic CR pillars and associated goals in 2023 to guide our approach and provide a framework for reporting on our performance. \n \nWe began reporting on CR metrics in 2021 and have continued to expand disclosure since then.

The CR Committee consists of senior leaders in key functions across the company, including legal, finance, investor relations, human resources, research and development, manufacturing, commercial, compliance and corporate affairs.\n \nThe CR Committee is part of our governance framework, which defines responsibilities and ensures we have the right systems and controls to oversee ethical and sustainable operations across our business. Our Board of Directors, specifically the Nominating, Governance and Review Committee, has oversight of our overall CR strategy and material CR risks and opportunities as outlined in the Committee’s charter. The Board receives updates related to corporate governance and corporate responsibility from the CR Committee at least once annually. We look to our stakeholders and third-party frameworks such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Health Care – Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals Standard and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures to inform our approach and our disclosures.\n \nWe will share progress on our CR goals and more details on our initiatives in our 2024 CR Report, which we expect to publish in April 2025 and available on our website. Nothing in the report or on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nEmployees and Human Capital\n \nAs of February 13, 2025, we employed 1,069 people, the vast majority of whom reside in the U.S. A significant number of our management and professional employees have had prior experience with pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical product companies. Our average employee turnover rate in 2023 was 6 percent, while the turnover for life sciences and medical device companies over this period was 21 percent according to a survey published by Radford – an Aon Hewitt Company. Given the uniqueness and complexity of our technology, it is critical to retain the knowledge and experience of outstanding long service employees. The experience and seniority of our employees is as critical to our future success as it has been to the success we have enjoyed to date.\n \nCollective bargaining agreements do not cover any of our employees, and management considers relations with our employees to be good. We believe that the future will be defined by outstanding people and we are committed to recruiting, developing, motivating, and rewarding them.\n \nWe encourage you to visit our website for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \n  36\n\n\n\nBenefits\n \nWe reward our employees individually on the basis of their responsibilities and accomplishments. We offer competitive compensation and benefits to our employees. In addition to salary and bonus programs, we also offer:\n\n●   Comprehensive medical, dental and vision insurance;\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   401(k) matching;\n--------------------\n\n●   Stock options, RSUs and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Vacation, holiday, sick time and paid time off for volunteering;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Wellness programs;\n----------------------\n\n●   Flexible spending accounts for health and dependent day care needs;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Family care benefits;\n-------------------------\n\n●   Life, AD&amp;D insurance and long-term disability insurance coverage options; and\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Employee Assistance Program, or EAP.\n----------------------------------------\n \nWe recognize achievements with salary increases, equity awards, promotions, and bonus opportunities.\n \nPay Equity\n \nWe are committed to paying our employees fairly, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, race, age or other personal characteristics. To ensure we are achieving our commitment, we benchmark and evaluate pay based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, an employee’s performance and internal equity. We also regularly review our compensation practices, in terms of our overall workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable.\n \nOn an annual basis, we monitor our pay equity status and market competitiveness, and perform a pay equity analysis that reviews pay equity by gender, ethnicity, race and age. Our 2024 pay equity analysis confirmed we do not have a statistically significant difference in pay for the same or similar work, regardless of gender, ethnicity, race or age.\n \nA Culture of Inclusion\n \n At Ionis, prejudicial barriers to human potential and productivity are foreign to our values. We recognize that for the full potential of our workforce to be realized, we must cultivate an inclusive culture where all employees feel empowered to contribute fully in an environment that values different perspectives, leading to better ​​​​​​​ideas and increased innovation. We have several employee-led resource groups dedicated to supporting engagement and empowerment and a diverse management team and board of directors. From our Executive Leadership Team to our newest hire, we strive for an environment where our employees feel a strong sense of belonging in our organization.\nTraining and Development\n \nWe designed our training and development programs to help employees gain important Ionis knowledge and develop the skills to be successful at Ionis. All of our trainings from new hire through senior leader, are focused on the Ionis culture and core principles and learning what we mean when we say: “Working the Ionis Way.”\n \nWe empower our employees to build rewarding careers at Ionis, driven by a culture of having a bias to act that encourages personal and professional employee growth. Ionis offers robust training opportunities with course offerings and events available to every employee regardless of level or function. In addition, employees also have access to Ionis’ learning and development library that houses important information on career growth and planning. By supporting our employees, we know that each professional development milestone enables our continued success.\n \n  37\n\n\n\nInformation about our Executive Officers\n \nThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers as of February 13, 2025:\n \n\n                 Name                       Age                                          Position                                       \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBrett P.

      "text": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\n \nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.\n \nRisks Related to the Commercialization of our Medicines\n  \nWe have limited experience as a company in commercializing medicines and we will have to continue to invest significant resources to develop our capabilities. If we are unable to effectively establish and maintain marketing, sales, market access, distribution, and related functions, or enter into agreements with third parties to commercialize our medicines, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our medicines.\n \nWe have historically relied on third parties to commercialize our marketed medicines and have limited experience as a company in commercializing medicines. TRYNGOLZA is our first independently launched medicine and we expect to independently launch additional medicines in the future. Any failure to effectively commercialize our medicines, including our failure to allocate resources to our commercial launches efficiently or timely, could adversely impact the revenue we generate from our medicines. If  the commercialization of TRYNGOLZA and future sales are less successful than anticipated by us or our investors or securities analysts, our stock price could decline and our business may be harmed.\n \nWe will have to continue to invest significant financial and management resources to build and maintain the infrastructure required to successfully commercialize our medicines. We will need to establish and maintain effective sales teams for each of our independently launched medicines and there are significant risks involved in managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. We must also continue to scale-up existing internal support functions to aid our commercialization efforts. Further, these existing support functions will need to work effectively in coordination with new commercial functional areas. Any failure to establish or maintain an effective commercialization infrastructure, including our sales, marketing, market access, distribution, and related capabilities, scale-up our existing support functions, or effectively integrate new functional areas, could adversely affect our ability to successfully commercialize our medicines.\n \nIf we choose to rely on third parties to assist us in commercializing our medicines, we may not be able to enter into collaborations or hire consultants or external service providers on acceptable financial terms, or at all. In addition, if we continue to engage third parties to assist us in the commercialization of our medicines, our product revenues and profitability may be lower than if we commercialized such medicines ourselves.\n \nThe proximity of our planned upcoming independent launches could increase the likelihood that such risks will occur.\n \n  40\n\n\n\nIf the market does not accept our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, we are not likely to generate substantial revenues or become consistently profitable.\n \nEven if our medicines are authorized for marketing, our success will depend upon the medical community, patients and third-party payers accepting our medicines as medically useful, cost-effective, safe and convenient. Even when the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities authorize our or our partners’ medicines for commercialization, doctors may not prescribe our medicines to treat patients. Furthermore, we and our partners may not successfully commercialize additional medicines.\n \nAdditionally, in many of the markets where we or our partners may sell our medicines in the future, if we or our partners cannot agree with the government or other third-party payers regarding the price we can charge for our medicines, we may not be able to sell our medicines in that market. Similarly, cost control initiatives by governments or third-party payers could decrease the price received for our medicines or increase patient coinsurance to a level that makes our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, economically unviable. If the pricing of any of our medicines decreases for any reason, it will reduce our revenue for such medicine. For example, Biogen has in the past disclosed that SPINRAZA revenue decreased in part due to lower pricing in the U.S. and certain rest-of-world markets.\n \nThe degree of market acceptance for our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, depends upon a number of factors, including the:\n \n\n●   receipt and scope of marketing authorizations;\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n●   establishment and demonstration in the medical and patient community of the efficacy and safety of our medicines, public perception regarding our medicines and their\n                                                                potential advantages over competing products;                                                            \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   cost and effectiveness of our medicines compared to other available therapies;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   patient convenience of the dosing regimen for our medicines; and\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n \nBased on the profile of our medicines, physicians, patients, patient advocates, payers or the medical community in general may not accept or use any of the medicines that we or our partners may develop.\n \nFor example, the product label for WAYLIVRA in the EU requires regular blood monitoring, which has negatively affected our ability to attract and retain patients for this medicine.\n \nIf government or other third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and payment rates for our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, our revenue will be limited.\n \nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our current and future products will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. The majority of patients in the U.S. who would fit within our target patient populations for our medicines have their healthcare supported by a combination of Medicare coverage, other government health programs such as Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new medicines when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be enough to make our medicines affordable. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Accordingly, our commercial medicines and our medicines in development will face competition from other therapies and medicines for limited financial resources. Furthermore, we or our partners may need to conduct post-marketing studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to satisfy third-party payers. These studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. In addition, third-party payers may never consider our future products as cost-effective and adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.\n \nThird-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medicines exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for medicines can differ significantly from payer to payer. For example, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. It is unclear how future litigation and healthcare reform measures will impact the ACA and our business.\n \n  41\n\n\n\nFurther, we believe that future coverage, reimbursement and pricing will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and in international markets. In the U.S., recent health reform measures have resulted in reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, legislation and executive orders designed to, among other things, reduce drug prices, increase competition (including by enhancing support for generic and biosimilar drugs), lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, curtail spread pricing practices by pharmacy benefit managers, and foster scientific innovation to promote better health care and improved health. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, includes key actions aimed at reducing the costs of prescription drugs and allows HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs covered under Medicare and establish a price cap on such drugs. The IRA, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics that have been on the market for at least seven years covered under Medicare, or the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions began to take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program is currently subject to legal challenges. Under this program, HHS has already announced the agreed-upon prices of the first drugs that were subject to price negotiations and will announce the agreed-upon prices of additional drugs in the coming years. In response to an October 2022 executive order, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the CMS Innovation Center that will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future. Further, on December 7, 2023, the Biden administration announced an initiative to control the price of prescription drugs using march-in rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. On December 8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published for comment a Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights which for the first time includes the price of a product as one factor an agency can use when deciding to exercise march-in rights. While march-in rights have not previously been exercised, it is uncertain if that will continue under the new framework. It is unclear whether or how these selected models or similar policy initiatives will impact prescription drug pricing in the future, particularly in light of the recent U.S. presidential and congressional elections.\n \nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. Our future product sales may be subject to additional discounts from list price in the form of rebates and discounts provided to covered entities under the Public Health Service Act 340B drug pricing program. Changes to the 340B program or to Medicare or Medicaid programs at the federal or state level, including outcomes of ongoing litigation in our industry, may impact our product prices and rebate liability.\n \nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, on January 5, 2024, the FDA approved Florida’s Section 804 Importation Program, or SIP, proposal to import certain drugs from Canada for specific state healthcare programs. It is unclear how this program will be implemented, including which drugs will be chosen, and whether it will be subject to legal challenges in the United States or Canada. Other states have also submitted SIP proposals that are pending review by the FDA. Any such approved importation plans, when implemented, may result in lower drug prices for products covered by those programs. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for medicines may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or international markets, which would negatively affect the potential commercial success of our products, our revenue and our profits.\n \nIf we or our partners fail to compete effectively, our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, will not generate significant revenues.\n \nOur competitors engage in drug discovery throughout the world, are numerous, and include, among others, major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biopharmaceutical firms. In addition, other companies are engaged in developing RNA-targeted technology. Our competitors may succeed in developing medicines that are:\n \n\n●   priced lower than our medicines;\n------------------------------------\n\n●   reimbursed more favorably by government and other third-party payers than our medicines;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   safer than our medicines;\n-----------------------------\n\n●   more effective than our medicines; or\n-----------------------------------------\n\n●   more convenient to use than our medicines.\n----------------------------------------------\n \nThese competitive developments could make our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, obsolete or non-competitive.\n \n  42\n\n\n\nCertain of our partners are pursuing other technologies or developing other medicines either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, to treat some of the same diseases our own collaborative programs target. Competition may negatively impact a partner’s focus on and commitment to our medicines and, as a result, could delay or otherwise negatively affect the commercialization of our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development.\n \nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical testing and human clinical studies of new pharmaceutical products, in obtaining FDA and other regulatory authorizations of such products and in commercializing such products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory authorization for products earlier than we do or more successfully commercialize their products.\n \nThere are several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in the development or commercialization in certain geographic markets of products against targets that are also targets of products in our development pipeline or of medicines we are commercializing. For example:\n \n\n●   Onasemnogene abeparvovec and risdiplam compete with SPINRAZA;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Acoramidis, patisiran, tafamidis, tafamidis meglumine and vutrisiran compete with WAINUA;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Nexiguran ziclumeran, ALXN2220 and NNC6019-0001 could compete with WAINUA;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Plozasiran, pegozafermin and NST-1024 could compete with TRYNGOLZA and WAYLIVRA;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Lanadelumab-flyo, C1 esterase inhibitor, berotralstat, C1 esterase inhibitor subcutaneous,\n       garadacimab, deucrictibant, NTLA-2002 and STAR-0215 could compete with donidalorsen;   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Olpasiran, zerlasiran, lepodisiran and muvalaplin could compete with pelacarsen;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   NI-005/AP-101 could compete with QALSODY;\n---------------------------------------------\n\n●   VIR-2218, VIR-3434, BRII-179, AB-729, selgantolimod, bersacapavir, REP 2139-Mg and VTP-300 could complete with bepirovirsen;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Budesonide, sparsentan, atrasentan, iptacopan, zigakibart, sibeprenlimab, atacicept, ravulizumab, vemircopan, felzartamab, telitacicept and povetacicept could compete\n                                                                             with sefaxersen; and                                                                         \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   GTX-102, alogabat and NNZ-2591 could compete with ION582.\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n \nSPINRAZA injection for intrathecal use is an antisense medicine indicated for the treatment of SMA patients of all ages approved in over 50 countries. Specifically, SPINRAZA faces competition from onasemnogene abeparvovec, a gene therapy product that was approved in the U.S. in May 2019 and in the EU in May 2020 for the treatment of SMA, as well as risdiplam, an oral product for the treatment of SMA that was approved in the U.S. in August 2020 and in the EU in March 2021. Biogen has in the past disclosed that SPINRAZA revenue decreased due to a reduction in demand as a result of increased competition and that future sales of SPINRAZA may be adversely affected by competing products.\n \nAdditionally, companies that are developing medicines that target the same patient populations as our medicines in development may compete with us to enroll participants in the clinical trials for such medicines, which could make it more difficult for us to complete enrollment for these clinical trials.\n \nOur medicines could be subject to regulatory limitations following approval.\n \nFollowing approval of a medicine, we and our partners must comply with comprehensive government regulations regarding the manufacture, marketing and distribution of medicines. Promotional communications regarding prescription medicines must be consistent with the information in the product’s approved labeling. We or our partners may not obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable to successfully commercialize our medicines, including our commercial medicines and our medicines in development.\n \nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to impose significant restrictions on an approved medicine through the product label and on advertising, promotional and distribution activities.\n \nPrescription medicines may be promoted only for the approved indication(s) in accordance with the approved label. The FDA and other regulatory authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.\n \n  43\n\n\n\nIn addition, when approved, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority may condition approval on the performance of post-approval clinical studies or patient monitoring, which could be time consuming and expensive. For example, in connection with the conditional marketing approval for WAYLIVRA in the EU, we are required to conduct a post-authorization safety study to evaluate the safety of WAYLIVRA on thrombocytopenia and bleeding in FCS patients taking WAYLIVRA. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory, the FDA, EC or other foreign regulatory authorities may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us or our partners that may be expensive and time consuming to fulfill.\n \nIf we or others identify side effects after any of our medicines are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur subsequent to regulatory approval, or if we, our CMOs or our partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we or our partners may, among other things, lose regulatory approval and be forced to withdraw products from the market, need to conduct additional clinical studies, incur restrictions on the marketing, distribution or manufacturing of the product, and/or change the labeling of our medicines.\n \nWe depend on our collaborations with Biogen for the development and commercialization of SPINRAZA and QALSODY.\n \nWe have entered into separate collaborative arrangements with Biogen to develop and commercialize SPINRAZA and QALSODY. We entered into these collaborations primarily to:\n \n\n●   fund our development activities for SPINRAZA and QALSODY;\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   seek and obtain regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA and QALSODY; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   successfully commercialize SPINRAZA and QALSODY.\n----------------------------------------------------\n \nWe are relying on Biogen to obtain additional regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA and QALSODY, generate additional clinical data for SPINRAZA and QALSODY, manufacture SPINRAZA and QALSODY, and successfully commercialize SPINRAZA and QALSODY. In general, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that Biogen devotes to our collaborations. If Biogen fails to further develop SPINRAZA or QALSODY, obtain additional regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA or QALSODY, manufacture SPINRAZA or QALSODY, or successfully commercialize SPINRAZA or QALSODY, or if Biogen’s efforts in any of these respects are ineffective, revenues for SPINRAZA or QALSODY would be negatively affected.\n \nIn addition, our collaborations with Biogen may not continue for various reasons. Biogen can terminate our collaborations at any time. If Biogen stops developing or commercializing SPINRAZA or QALSODY, we would have to seek or spend additional funding, and SPINRAZA’s or QALSODY’s commercialization may be harmed.\n \nWe depend on our collaboration with AstraZeneca for the joint development and commercialization of WAINUA.\n \nWe have entered into a collaborative arrangement with AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize WAINUA. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we and AstraZeneca will co-develop and co-commercialize WAINUA in the U.S. and AstraZeneca will have the sole right to commercialize WAINUA in all other countries. As a company we do not have experience with co-commercialization arrangements. We also do not have control over (1) the amount and timing of resources that AstraZeneca devotes to our collaboration, particularly outside of the U.S; (2) the pricing and reimbursement strategies for WAINUA; and (3) whether AstraZeneca elects to terminate the collaborative arrangement. If the co-commercialization arrangement for WAINUA is not successful for any reason, WAINUA may not meet our commercial objectives and our revenues for WAINUA may be limited.\n \nIn addition, a Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, having equal membership from us and AstraZeneca, and various subcommittees oversee and coordinate the development, manufacturing, commercialization and other exploitation activities for WAINUA in the U.S. by mutual agreement. If any subcommittee cannot reach unanimous agreement on any matter within its respective scope of authority, such matter may be referred to the JSC for resolution. If the JSC cannot come to a mutual agreement on any particular matter, this could delay our ability to develop or commercialize WAINUA.\n \nIf we are not successful in expanding our manufacturing capabilities or cannot manufacture our medicines or contract with a third party to manufacture our medicines at costs that allow us to charge competitive prices to buyers, we cannot market our products profitably.\n \nTo successfully commercialize any of our medicines, we need to optimize and manage large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities either on a standalone basis or through a third-party manufacturer. As our drug development and commercial pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical trial and commercial manufacturing capacity. We will also need to ensure that we have the manufacturing capabilities in place to support advances in our drug development activities, such as new chemistries. While we believe our current capabilities and those we obtain through third-party manufacturers support our manufacturing needs now, it will be important to expand our manufacturing infrastructure in the future, which will likely require substantial expenditures. If we are not successful in executing this expansion, it could limit our ability to meet our manufacturing requirements and commercial objectives in the future.\n \n  44\n\n\n\nIn addition, we have limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products of the chemical class represented by our medicines, called oligonucleotides, on a commercial scale for the systemic administration of a medicine. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture our medicines, and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing. If a supplier chooses to devote more resources to other products, especially products with higher manufacturing capacity needs, that could impact such supplier’s capability to deliver our requirements timely. Further, we must continue to improve our manufacturing processes to allow us to reduce our drug costs. We or our partners may not be able to manufacture our medicines at a cost or in quantities necessary to make commercially successful products.\n \nManufacturers, including us, must adhere to the FDA’s cGMP regulations and similar regulations in foreign countries, which the applicable regulatory authorities enforce through facilities inspection programs. We, our partners and our contract manufacturers may not comply or maintain compliance with cGMP, or similar foreign regulations. Non-compliance could significantly delay or prevent receipt of marketing authorizations for our medicines, including authorizations for our commercial medicines and our medicines in development, or could result in enforcement action after authorization that might limit the commercial success of our medicines.\n \nWe rely on third-party manufacturers to supply the drug substance and drug product for TRYNGOLZA and WAINUA and drug product for WAYLIVRA. The operations of our suppliers, many of which are located outside of the United States, are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control. For example, there have been Congressional legislative proposals, such as the recent bill titled the BIOSECURE Act, to discourage contracting with Chinese companies for the development or manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. In addition, merger and acquisition activity within the commercial manufacturing space could reduce the availability of resources from our third-party manufacturers. Delays or disruption to our own or third-party commercial manufacturing capabilities for any reason could limit the commercial success of our medicines.\n \nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of our Medicines\n \nIf we or our partners fail to obtain regulatory approval for our medicines and additional approvals for our commercial medicines, we or our partners cannot sell them in the applicable markets.\n \nWe cannot guarantee that any of our medicines will be considered safe and effective or will be approved for commercialization. In addition, it is possible that our commercial medicines may not be approved in additional markets or for additional indications. We and our partners must conduct time-consuming, extensive and costly clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of each of our medicines before they can be approved or receive additional approvals for sale. We and our partners must conduct these studies in compliance with FDA regulations and with comparable regulations in other countries.\n \nWe and our partners may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for our medicines. It is possible that regulatory authorities will not approve our medicines for marketing or our commercial medicines in additional markets or for additional indications. If the FDA or another regulatory authority believes that we or our partners have not sufficiently demonstrated the safety or efficacy of any of our medicines, including our commercial medicines or our medicines in development, the authority will not approve the specific medicine or will require additional studies, which could be time consuming and expensive and delay or harm commercialization of the medicine. For example, in August 2018 we received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the new drug application for WAYLIVRA in which the FDA determined that the safety concerns identified with WAYLIVRA in our clinical development program outweighed the expected benefits of triglyceride lowering in patients with FCS. We also received a Notice of Non-Compliance Withdrawal Letter, or Non-W, from Health Canada for WAYLIVRA in November 2018.\n \nThe FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a medicine for many reasons, including:\n \n\n●   such authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we or our partners may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that a medicine is safe and effective for any indication;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   such authorities may not accept clinical data from studies conducted at clinical facilities that have deficient clinical practices or that are in countries where the\n                                                           standard of care is potentially different from the U.S.;                                                      \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we or our partners may be unable to demonstrate that our medicine’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks to support approval;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   such authorities may disagree with the interpretation of data from preclinical or clinical studies;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   such authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers who manufacture clinical and commercial supplies for our\n                                                                                  medicines; and                                                                             \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the approval policies or regulations of such authorities or their prior guidance to us or our partners during clinical development may significantly change in a manner\n                                                             rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.                                                        \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n  45\n\n\n\nFailure to receive marketing authorization for our medicines in development, or failure to receive additional marketing authorizations for our commercial medicines, or delays in these authorizations, could prevent or delay commercial introduction of the medicine, and, as a result, could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from product sales.\n \nIf the results of clinical testing indicate that any of our medicines are not suitable for commercial use, we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.\n \nDrug discovery and drug development have inherent risks and the historical failure rate for drugs is high. Antisense medicines are a relatively new approach to therapeutics. If we cannot demonstrate that our medicines are safe and effective for human use in the intended indication(s), we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.\n \nEven if our medicines are successful in preclinical and human clinical studies, the medicines may not be successful in late-stage clinical studies. Similarly, topline, preliminary or interim data we release for any of our clinical studies may not be indicative of full or final results from such study.\n \nSuccessful results in preclinical or initial human clinical studies, including the Phase 2 results for some of our medicines in development, may not predict the results of subsequent clinical studies. If any of our medicines in Phase 3 clinical studies do not show sufficient safety and efficacy in patients with the targeted indication, or if such studies are discontinued for any other reason, it could negatively impact our development and commercialization goals for these medicines and our stock price could decline. In addition, we may release topline, preliminary or interim data for any of our clinical studies.  The interim, topline or preliminary results we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated.  As a result, such data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\n \nIn the past, we have invested in clinical studies of medicines that have not met the primary clinical endpoints in their Phase 3 studies or have been discontinued for other reasons. For example, in October 2021, Biogen reported that QALSODY did not meet the primary clinical endpoint in the Phase 3 VALOR study; however, trends favoring QALSODY were seen across multiple secondary and exploratory measures of disease activity and clinical function. In addition, in March 2021, Roche decided to discontinue dosing in the Phase 3 GENERATION HD1 study of tominersen in patients with manifest Huntington’s disease based on the results of a pre-planned review of data from the Phase 3 study conducted by an unblinded Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Similar results could occur in clinical studies for our other medicines.\n \nThere are a number of factors that could cause a clinical study to fail or be delayed, including:\n \n\n●   the clinical study may produce negative or inconclusive results;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   regulators may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we, our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could suspend or terminate a clinical study due to adverse side effects of a medicine on subjects or lack of\n                                                                             efficacy in the trial;                                                                         \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   we or our partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical studies;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   enrollment in our clinical studies may be slower than we anticipate;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●      we or our partners, including our independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers on which we rely, may not    \n    identify, recruit or train suitable clinical investigators at a sufficient number of study sites or timely enroll a sufficient number of study subjects in the clinical study;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the institutional review board for a prospective site might withhold or delay its approval for the study;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   people who enroll in the clinical study may later drop out due to adverse events, a perception they are not benefiting from participating in the study, fatigue with the\n                                                                   clinical study process or personal issues;                                                               \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   a clinical study site may deviate from the protocol for the study;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the cost of our clinical studies may be greater than we anticipate;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our partners may decide not to exercise any existing options to license and conduct additional clinical studies for our medicines; and\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the supply or quality of our medicines or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical studies may be insufficient, inadequate or delayed.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nFurther, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could request, among other things, additional information or commitments before we can start or continue a clinical study, protocol amendments, increased safety monitoring, additional product labeling information, and post-approval commitments. This happened in connection with the conditional marketing approval for WAYLIVRA in the EU, as the European Commission is requiring us to conduct a post-authorization safety study to evaluate the safety of WAYLIVRA on thrombocytopenia and bleeding in FCS patients taking WAYLIVRA. In addition, under accelerated approval the FDA is requiring completion of the ongoing Phase 3 trial for QALSODY to confirm the clinical benefit of QALSODY.\n \n  46\n\n\n\nMoreover, our commercial medicines are chemically similar to each other. As a result, a safety observation we encounter with one of our medicines could have, or be perceived by a regulatory authority to have, an impact on a different medicine we are developing. This could cause the FDA or other regulators to ask questions or take actions that could harm or delay our ability to develop and commercialize our medicines or increase our costs. Any failure or delay in our clinical studies could reduce the commercial potential or viability of our medicines.\n \nWe depend on third parties to conduct clinical studies for our medicines and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our development and commercialization plans.\n \nWe depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct our clinical studies for our medicines and expect to continue to do so in the future. For example, we use clinical research organizations, such as Icon Clinical Research Limited, Medpace, Inc., Parexel International Corporation, Syneos Health, Inc. and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. for the clinical studies for our medicines, including WAINUA for the treatment of ATTR-CM, donidalorsen, olezarsen, ulefnersen and zilganersen. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical studies, but do not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators are not our employees, but we are responsible for ensuring that such investigators conduct each of our clinical studies in accordance with the general investigational plan and approved protocols for the study. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. For example, some of our key vendors have in the past experienced labor shortages, which impacted their ability to perform services for us for certain of our clinical trials. Subsequent failures of these third parties to carry out their obligations, or a termination of our relationship with such third parties, could delay or prevent the development, marketing authorization and commercialization of our medicines.\n \nIn addition, while we do not have any clinical trial sites in Russia, Ukraine or Gaza, we do have a limited number of clinical trial sites in Israel that may be materially impacted by the ongoing military conflicts in Israel and elsewhere in the Middle East and could result in difficulties enrolling or completing our clinical trials in such areas on schedule.\n \nSince corporate partnering is part of our strategy to fund the advancement and commercialization of our development programs, if any of our collaborative partners fail to fund our collaborative programs, or if we cannot obtain additional partners, we may have to delay or stop progress on our drug development programs.\n \nTo date, corporate partnering has played a significant role in our strategy to fund our development programs and to add key development resources. While we are now commercializing some of our medicines independently, we still plan to continue to rely on additional collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize some of our unpartnered medicines. However, we may not be able to negotiate favorable collaborative arrangements for these drug programs. If we cannot continue to secure additional collaborative partners, our revenues could decrease and the development of our medicines could suffer.\n \nOur corporate partners are developing and funding many of the medicines in our development pipeline. For example, we are relying on:\n \n\n●   AstraZeneca for the joint development and funding of WAINUA;\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Novartis for development and funding of pelacarsen;\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   GSK for development and funding of bepirovirsen; and\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Roche for development and funding of sefaxersen.\n----------------------------------------------------\n \nIf any of these pharmaceutical companies stops developing and funding these medicines, our business could suffer and we may not have, or be willing to dedicate, the resources available to develop these medicines on our own. Our collaborators can terminate their relationships with us under certain circumstances, many of which are outside of our control. For example, in 2022, Pfizer and Bayer decided to discontinue the clinical development programs for vupanorsen and fesomersen, respectively.\n \nEven with funding from corporate partners, if our partners do not effectively perform their obligations under our agreements with them, it would delay or stop the progress of our drug development and commercial programs.\n \nIn addition to receiving funding, we enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to:\n \n\n●   conduct clinical studies;\n-----------------------------\n\n●   seek and obtain marketing authorizations; and\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n●   manufacture and commercialize our medicines.\n------------------------------------------------\n \n  47\n\n\n\nOnce we have secured a collaborative arrangement to further develop and commercialize one of our drug development programs, such as our collaborations with AstraZeneca, Biogen, GSK, Novartis, Otsuka and Roche, these collaborations may not continue or result in commercialized medicines, or may not progress as quickly as we anticipated.\n \nFor example, a collaborator such as AstraZeneca, Biogen, GSK, Novartis, Otsuka or Roche, could determine that it is in its financial interest to:\n \n\n●   pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products that may be competitive with the medicine that is part of the collaboration with us;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   pursue higher-priority programs or change the focus of its own development programs; or\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   choose to devote fewer resources to our medicines than it does to its own medicines.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nIf any of these occur, it could affect our partner’s commitment to the collaboration with us and could delay or otherwise negatively affect the commercialization of our medicines, including QALSODY, SPINRAZA, WAINUA, bepirovirsen, donidalorsen, sefaxersen and pelacarsen.\n \nWe may not be able to benefit from designations for our medicines from regulatory authorities that are intended to confer benefits such as financial incentives or an accelerated regulatory pathway.\n \nIn the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a medicine as an Orphan Drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process, but it can provide financial incentives, such as tax advantages and user-fee waivers, as well as longer regulatory exclusivity periods. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation to TRYNGOLZA for the treatment of patients with FCS, to WAINUA for the treatment of patients with ATTR, to ulefnersen for the treatment of patients with FUS-ALS, to ION582 for the treatment of patients with Angelman syndrome, and to some of our earlier stage medicines. The FDA and EMA have granted Orphan Drug designation to donidalorsen for the treatment of patients with HAE, to WAYLIVRA for the treatment of patients with FCS, to tominersen for the treatment of patients with HD, and to some of our earlier stage medicines. In addition, the EMA has granted Orphan Drug designation to WAYLIVRA for the treatment of patients with FPL. Even if approval is obtained on a medicine that has been designated as an Orphan Drug, we may lose Orphan Drug exclusivity if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we cannot assure sufficient quantity of the applicable medicine to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition, or if a competitor is able to gain approval for the same or a substantially similar medicine in a safer or more effective form or that makes a major contribution to patient care. If we lose Orphan Drug exclusivity on any of our medicines, we may face increased competition and lose market share for such medicine.\n \nWe may also seek rare pediatric disease designation for some of our medicines. The FDA defines “rare pediatric disease” as a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years or is a rare disease or condition within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. Designation of a medicine as a medicine for a rare pediatric disease does not guarantee that a marketing application for such medicine will meet the eligibility criteria for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, or PRV, at the time the application is approved. Under the FDCA, we will need to request a rare pediatric disease PRV in our original marketing application for any potential medicine for which we have received rare pediatric disease designation. The FDA may determine that a marketing application for any such medicine, if approved, does not meet the eligibility criteria for a PRV. Under the current statutory sunset provisions, after December 20, 2024, the FDA may only award a PRV for an approved rare pediatric disease application if the sponsor has rare pediatric disease designation for the drug or biologic that is the subject of such application, and that designation was granted by December 20, 2024. After September 30, 2026, the FDA may not award any rare pediatric disease PRVs. However, it is possible the authority for FDA to award rare pediatric disease PRV will be further extended by Congress.\n \n  48\n\n\n\nRisks Associated with our Businesses as a Whole\n \nRisks related to our financial condition\n \nIf we fail to obtain timely funding, we may need to curtail or abandon some of our programs.\n \nMany of our medicines are undergoing clinical studies or are in the early stages of research and development. Most of our programs will require significant additional research, development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, marketing authorizations, preclinical activities and commitment of significant additional resources prior to their successful commercialization. In addition, as we commercialize more medicines on our own, we will need to invest significant financial resources to continue developing the infrastructure required to successfully commercialize our medicines, including building and maintaining new support functions and scaling up existing internal support functions and expanding our manufacturing capabilities. All of these activities will require significant cash. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments equal to $2.3 billion. If we or our partners do not meet our goals to successfully commercialize our medicines, including our commercial medicines, or to license certain medicines and proprietary technologies, we will need additional funding in the future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors such as:\n \n\n●   successful commercialization of our commercial medicines;\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the profile and launch timing of our medicines in development;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in existing collaborative relationships and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   continued scientific progress in our research, drug discovery and development programs;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the size of our programs and progress with preclinical and clinical studies;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the time and costs involved in obtaining marketing authorizations;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   competing technological and market developments, including the introduction by others of new therapies that address our markets; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   our manufacturing requirements and capacity to fulfill such requirements.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nIf we need additional funds, we may need to raise them through public or private financing. Additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the shares of existing stockholders will be diluted and the price, as well as the price of our other securities, may decline. For example, in September 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of 11,500,000 shares of our common stock for total net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, of approximately $489.1 million. If adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may have to cut back on one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs, or commercial operations. Alternatively, we may obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others, which could require us to give up rights to certain of our technologies or medicines.\n \nWe have incurred losses, and our business will suffer if we fail to consistently achieve profitability in the future.\n \nBecause drug discovery and development require substantial lead-time and money prior to commercialization, our expenses have generally exceeded our revenue since we were founded in January 1989. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $2.2 billion and stockholders’ equity of approximately $0.6 billion. Most of our income has historically come from collaborative arrangements, including commercial revenue from royalties and R&D revenue, with additional income from research grants and the sale or licensing of our patents, as well as interest income. We will now and continuing into the foreseeable future need to invest significant financial resources to commercialize medicines on our own and expect that our income in the future will be driven primarily by commercial sales. If we do not earn substantial revenue from commercial sales, we may incur additional operating losses in the future, which could restrict our ability to successfully develop additional medicines or sustain future profitability.\n \nWe may not be entitled to obtain additional milestone payments under our royalty monetization agreement with Royalty Pharma.\n \nIn January 2023, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement with Royalty Pharma Investments. In addition to the $500 million we received at closing, this agreement makes available to us up to an additional $625 million in milestone payments. However, these additional milestone payments are subject to satisfaction of certain conditions related to the regulatory approval or commercial sales of pelacarsen, in certain cases by specific deadlines. Should we not satisfy such conditions by the applicable deadlines, or if we fail to meet our obligations or default under this agreement, the actual amount of additional payments to us could be substantially less than the maximum amounts available thereunder.\n \n  49\n\n\n\nRisks related to our intellectual property\n \nIf we cannot protect our patent rights or our other proprietary rights, others may compete more effectively against us.\n \nOur success depends to a significant degree upon whether we can continue to develop, secure and maintain intellectual property rights to proprietary products and services. However, we may not receive issued patents on any of our pending patent applications in the U.S. or in other countries and we may not be able to obtain, maintain or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, any of which could impact our ability to compete effectively. In addition, the scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, other parties may successfully challenge, invalidate or circumvent our issued patents or patents licensed to us so that our patent rights do not create an effective competitive barrier or revenue source.\n \nWe cannot be certain that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and courts in the U.S. or the patent offices and courts in foreign countries will consider the claims in our patents and applications covering our commercial medicines, or any of our medicines in development, as patentable. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products off-label. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent, even through legal action.\n \nIf we or any licensor partner loses or cannot obtain patent protection for our commercial medicines or any of our medicines in development, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\n \nIntellectual property litigation could be expensive and prevent us from pursuing our programs.\n \nFrom time to time, we have to defend our intellectual property rights. If we are involved in an intellectual property dispute, we may need to litigate to defend our rights or assert them against others. Disputes can involve arbitration, litigation or proceedings declared by the U.S. PTO or the International Trade Commission or foreign patent authorities. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\n \nIf a third party claims that our medicines or technology infringe its patents or other intellectual property rights, we may have to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, pay license fees or cease certain activities. We may not be able to obtain a license to needed intellectual property on favorable terms, if at all. There are many patents issued or applied for in the biotechnology industry, and we may not be aware of patents or patent applications held by others that relate to our business. This is especially true since patent applications in the U.S. are filed confidentially for the first 18 months. Moreover, the validity and breadth of biotechnology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal issues remain.\n \nRisks related to product liability\n \nWe are exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future or at all.\n \nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of therapeutic products, including potential product liability claims related to our commercial medicines and our medicines in development. We have clinical study insurance coverage and commercial product liability insurance coverage. However, this insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims against us, or be available to us at an acceptable cost, if at all. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our medicines, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical study volunteers and loss of revenues. Thus, whether or not we are insured, a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material.\n \n  50\n\n\n\nRisks related to our personnel\n \nThe loss of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, could make it more difficult to run our business and reduce our likelihood of success.\n \nWe are dependent on the principal members of our management, scientific and commercial staff. We do not have employment agreements with any of our employees that would prevent them from leaving us. The loss of our key management, scientific or commercial employees might slow the achievement of important research and development or commercial goals. It is also critical to our success that we recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work and that we recruit and retain qualified marketing, sales, market access, distribution, and related personnel to commercialize our medicines. We may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel on acceptable terms because of intense competition for experienced personnel among many pharmaceutical and health care companies, universities and non-profit research institutions. In addition, failure to succeed in clinical studies or in commercializing our medicines may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel.\n \nRisks related to health epidemics, climate change and other events\n \nOur business may be adversely affected by health epidemics, climate change, extreme weather events, fires, earthquakes, war, civil or political unrest, terrorism or other catastrophic events.\n \nOur business could be adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we or our partners are commercializing our medicines, have concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, and could cause disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers and contract research organizations upon whom we rely. For example, enrollment in some of our clinical trials was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n \nIn recent years, extreme weather events and changing weather patterns have become more common. As a result, we are potentially exposed to varying natural disaster or extreme weather risks such as fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, floods, or other events that may result from the impact of climate change on the environment, any of which could impact our business and manufacturing operations. The potential impacts of climate change may also include increased operating costs associated with additional regulatory requirements and investments in reducing energy, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we currently manufacture most of our research and clinical supplies in a manufacturing facility located in Carlsbad, California, and various regions within California have recently experienced numerous catastrophic wildfires. We manufacture the finished drug product for TRYNGOLZA, WAYLIVRA and eplontersen for ongoing clinical trials at third-party contract manufacturers. Biogen manufactures the finished drug product for SPINRAZA and QALSODY and AstraZeneca is responsible for WAINUA’s commercial drug supply. The facilities and the equipment we, our partners and our contract manufacturers use to research, develop and manufacture our medicines would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace.\n \nOur facilities or those of our partners or contract manufacturers may be harmed by natural disasters or other events outside our control, such as earthquakes, war, civil or political unrest, deliberate acts of sabotage, terrorism or industrial accidents such as fire and explosion, whether due to human or equipment error, and if such facilities are affected by a disaster or other event, our development and commercialization efforts would be delayed. Although we possess property damage and business interruption insurance coverage, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our development and commercialization activities could be harmed or delayed by a shutdown or significant disruption of the U.S. government, including the FDA or the U.S. PTO.\n \n  51\n\n\n\nRisks related to personal information, cybersecurity, social media and artificial intelligence\n \nWe are dependent on data as well as information technology systems and infrastructure, which exposes us to data protection risks.\n \nWe are dependent upon our own and third-party data as well as information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. The personal information we process subjects us to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, rules and regulations, contractual obligations, industry standards and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Our personal information obligations require us to implement and maintain certain practices, including those in relation to cross-border transfers of personal information. The multitude and complexity of our information technology systems and infrastructure make them vulnerable to a variety of evolving threats that may result in systems or data interruption, corruption, destruction, disruption of data integrity, malicious intrusion, or random attacks or other compromise (such as due to malfunctions, software vulnerabilities, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, malicious actors and personnel error). Data privacy or security incidents or breaches pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, particularly as companies (including us) continue to move to more remote work structures. In addition, the number and frequency of cybersecurity events globally may be heightened during times of geopolitical tension or instability between countries, including, for example, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and military conflicts in the Middle East and the surrounding areas, or collectively, conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, as well as related political or economic responses and counter-responses by various global actors.\n \nCybersecurity related events could include the deployment or use of harmful malware or malicious code, denial-of-service attacks, credential stuffing attacks, credential harvesting attacks, social engineering attacks (including deep fakes), ransomware and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data as well as information systems and infrastructure. Our current, past and prospective business partners face similar risks and any security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. A security breach or privacy violation (including perceived breaches or violations) could result in any of the following, any of which could disrupt our business and result in increased costs or loss of revenue:\n \n\n●   harm our reputation;\n------------------------\n\n●   delay progress on the development of our medicines;\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   compel us to comply with applicable security or data breach notification obligations (including laws);\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   result in the diversion of monetary funds and other company resources;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   subject us to financial or other penalties, regulatory investigations or actions, including mandatory and costly corrective actions; and\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to litigation or other liabilities.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nRisk mitigation strategies such as liability limitations in our contracts and insurance coverage may prove inadequate if there is a security breach or privacy violation. While we have invested, and continue to invest, in the protection of our data and information technology systems and infrastructure, our efforts may not be successful. Non-compliance with relevant data protection obligations or a failure to secure our data, information technology systems or infrastructure could adversely affect our business and operations and result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us.\n \nThe increasing use of social media platforms and artificial intelligence based software presents new risks and challenges.\n \nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our medicines and the diseases our therapies are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear and create uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on social media. We may also encounter criticism on social media regarding our company, management, or medicines. Our reputation could be damaged by negative publicity or if adverse information concerning us is posted on social media platforms or similar mediums, which we may not be able to reverse. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.\n \nAdditionally, artificial intelligence, or AI, based software is increasingly being used in the biopharmaceutical industry. Use of AI based software may lead to the release of confidential proprietary information, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of our intellectual property.\n \n  52\n\n\n\nRisks related to our securities and the global credit markets\n \nIf we do not progress in our programs as anticipated, the price of our securities could decrease.\n \nFor planning purposes, we estimate and may disclose the timing of a variety of clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as when we anticipate a certain medicine will enter clinical trials, when we anticipate disclosing clinical data, when we anticipate completing a clinical study, or when we anticipate filing an application for, or obtaining, marketing authorization, or when we or our partners plan to commercially launch a medicine. We base our estimates on present facts and a variety of assumptions, many of which are outside of our control. If we do not achieve milestones in accordance with our or our investors’ or securities analysts’ expectations, including milestones related to our commercial medicines and medicines in development, the price of our securities could decrease. In addition, our share price may be dependent upon the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover our business. If our results do not meet these analysts’ forecasts, the expectations of our investors or the financial guidance we provide to investors in any period, the market price of our common stock could decline. Our ability to meet analysts’ forecasts, investors’ expectations and our financial guidance is substantially dependent on our ability to maintain or increase sales of our commercial medicines, both partnered and unpartnered.\n \nIf the price of our securities continues to be highly volatile, this could make it harder to liquidate your investment and could increase your risk of suffering a loss.\n \nThe market price of our common stock, like that of the securities of many other biopharmaceutical companies, has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. These fluctuations in our common stock price may significantly affect the trading price of our securities. During the 12 months preceding December 31, 2024, the closing market price of our common stock ranged from $53.55 to $33.73 per share. Many factors can affect the market price of our securities, including, for example, fluctuations in our operating results, financing transactions, announcements of collaborations, clinical study results, technological innovations or new products being developed by us or our competitors, the commercial success of our approved medicines, governmental regulation, marketing authorizations, changes in payers’ reimbursement policies, developments in patent or other proprietary rights and public concern regarding the safety of our medicines.\n \nBroad market factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. For example, events such as the ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East have caused disruptions of global financial markets and resulted in increased volatility in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock. Nasdaq, and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for biotechnology or pharmaceutical stocks or the stocks of other companies that investors perceive to be similar to us, the opportunities in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical market or the stock market in general, could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations.\n \nNegative conditions in the global credit markets and financial services and other industries may adversely affect our business, financial condition or stock price.\n \nThe global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions recently, including as a result of the ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. These disruptions can result in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not occur. If the current equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our operations, growth plans, financial performance or stock price. In addition, our insurance carriers and insurance policies covering all aspects of our business may become financially unstable or may not be sufficient to cover any or all of our losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\n \n  53\n\n\n\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business and marketing our medicines internationally could adversely affect our business. In addition to our U.S. operations, we are commercializing WAYLIVRA in the EU, Latin America and certain Caribbean countries. We face risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, pricing and reimbursement, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. Because we have international operations, we are subject to numerous risks associated with international business activities, including:\n \n\n●   compliance with differing or unexpected regulatory requirements for our medicines and foreign employees;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   complexities associated with managing multiple payer reimbursement regimes, government payers or patient self-pay systems;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   in certain circumstances, increased dependence on the commercialization efforts and regulatory compliance of third-party distributors or strategic partners;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   U.S. and foreign government tariffs, trade and export restrictions, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and its equivalent in foreign jurisdictions;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   economic weakness, including inflation, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, political instability or public health issues or health epidemics, in particular\n                                                                       foreign countries or globally;                                                                  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations related to doing business in\n                                                                              another country;                                                                         \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   the potential for a local seller, faced with higher local prices, importing medicines from an international market with lower prices rather than buying such medicines\n                                                            locally, which is referred to as parallel importation;                                                        \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   compliance with tax, employment, privacy, immigration and labor laws, regulations and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in diplomatic and trade relationships.\n--------------------------------------------------\n \nOur business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010. In many other countries, the healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, any dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to regulation under the FCPA. There is no certainty that all employees and third-party business partners (including our contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws. Importantly, we do not control the actions of manufacturers and other third-party agents, although we may be liable for their actions. Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\n \nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, convertible notes documents, call spread hedge transaction documents and Delaware law may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares.\n \nOur certificate of incorporation provides for classified terms for the members of our board of directors. Our certificate also includes a provision that requires at least 66 2/3 percent of our voting stockholders to approve a merger or certain other business transactions with, or proposed by, any holder of 15 percent or more of our voting stock, except in cases where certain directors approve the transaction or certain minimum price criteria and other procedural requirements are met.\n \nOur certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent. In addition, only our board of directors, chairperson of the board or chief executive officer can call special meetings of our stockholders. We have in the past, and may in the future, implement a stockholders’ rights plan, also called a poison pill, which could make it uneconomical for a third party to acquire our company on a hostile basis. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of, and issue shares of preferred stock, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company without action by our stockholders.\n \nThe provisions of our convertible senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their notes or a portion of their notes, which may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then-current market prices.\n \n  54\n\n\n\nIn 2023, we completed a $575 million offering of 1.75% Notes and used $488.2 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 1.75% Notes to repurchase $504.4 million of our 0.125% Notes. In 2021, we completed a $632.5 million offering of 0% Notes and used $319.0 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 0% Notes to repurchase the remaining $309.9 million of our 1% Notes. In 2019, we entered into privately negotiated exchange and/or subscription agreements with certain new investors and certain holders of our existing 1% Notes to exchange $375.6 million of our 1% Notes for $439.3 million of our 0.125% Notes, and to issue $109.5 million of our 0.125% Notes. Additionally, in connection with the pricing of our 0% Notes and 0.125% Notes, we entered into call spread transactions in which we purchased note hedges and sold warrants. For our 0.125% Notes, the note hedges expired upon maturity of the 0.125% Notes and the warrants will expire in March 2025. Terminating or unwinding the call spread transactions for our 0% Notes could require us to make substantial payments to the counterparties under those agreements or may increase our stock price. The costs or any increase in stock price that may arise from terminating or unwinding such agreements could make an acquisition of our company significantly more expensive to the purchaser.\n \nThese provisions, as well as Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and other of our agreements, may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices, and may limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their best interests.\n \nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\n \nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect trading prices of our securities. For example, we may issue approximately 21.6 million shares of our common stock upon conversion of our 1.75% Notes and 0% Notes. In connection with the issuance of the 0% Notes, we entered into certain call spread transactions covering 10.9 million shares that we expect will offset the dilution to holders of common stock upon any conversion of those notes. However, the anti-dilutive effect of the convertible note hedges is offset by certain warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 0% Notes. The addition of any of these shares into the public market may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities.\n \nIn addition, pursuant to the call spread transactions we entered into in connection with the pricing of our 0% Notes, the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time at or prior to the conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock, other of our securities, or other instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, that they may wish to use in connection with such hedging, which may have a negative effect on the conversion value of those notes and an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock. The call spread transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion of our 0% Notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted 0% Notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.\n \nRisks related to compliance with laws\n \nOur operations are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry.\n \nOur operations are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, including federal and state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, such as the federal Sunshine Act, and health information privacy and security laws, which are subject to change at any time. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. Penalties for violations of applicable healthcare laws and regulations may include significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if we enter into a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. In addition, violations may also result in reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings.\n \n  55\n\n\n\nBecause we use biological materials, hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds, if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\n \nOur research, development and manufacturing activities involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We store most of these materials and various wastes resulting from their use at our facilities in Carlsbad, California pending ultimate use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause:\n \n\n●   interruption of our research, development and manufacturing efforts;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   injury to our employees and others;\n---------------------------------------\n\n●   environmental damage resulting in costly clean up; and\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   liabilities under federal, state and local laws and regulations governing health and human safety, as well as the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials\n                                                                         and resultant waste products.                                                                      \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nIn such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Although we carry insurance for pollution liability in amounts and types that we consider commercially reasonable, the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate. If our losses exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition would be adversely affected.\n \nOur business is subject to changing regulations for corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\n \nEach year we are required to evaluate our internal control systems to allow management to report on, and our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to attest to, our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, we continue to incur additional expenses and divert our management’s time to comply with these regulations. In addition, if we cannot continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, or The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\n \nThe SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted, and in August 2022, the SEC adopted additional rules and regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act related to “say on pay” and proxy access. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which has and may in the future lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business.\n \nRisks related to taxes\n \nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryovers and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n \nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses, or NOLs, carried over from a prior taxable year. Under the Code, we can carry forward our NOLs to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire. The same is true of other unused tax attributes, such as tax credits.\n \nUnder the current U.S. federal income tax law, U.S. federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such U.S. federal NOLs is limited to 80 percent of taxable income.\n \nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage-point cumulative change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. As a result of our merger with Akcea Therapeutics, Inc. in 2020, or the Akcea Merger, we are subject to the separate return limitation year, or SRLY, rules. Under the SRLY rules, our utilization of Akcea’s pre-merger NOL and tax credit carryforwards is limited to the amount of income that Akcea contributes to our consolidated taxable income. The Akcea pre-merger tax attributes cannot be used to offset any of the income that Ionis contributes to our consolidated taxable income. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. For example, in June 2024, California enacted Senate Bill 167, or SB 167, which, with certain exceptions, suspends the ability to use California net operating losses to offset California income and limits the ability to use California business tax credits to offset California taxes, for taxable years beginning after 2023 and before 2027.\n \n  56\n\n\n\nOur future taxable income could be impacted by changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties.\n \nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could materially affect us.\n \nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\n \nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, sales taxes in the U.S., withholding taxes and transaction taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. In particular, our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could increase in the future as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting, or BEPS,  project led by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, and other initiatives led by the OECD or the European Commission. The OECD is leading work on an iteration of the BEPS project based on two “pillars” (subject to certain revenue thresholds), involving the reallocation of taxing rights in respect of certain multinational enterprises above a fixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business) (referred to as “Pillar One”) and imposing a minimum effective corporate tax rate on certain multinational enterprises (referred to as “Pillar Two”). Based on the minimum revenue thresholds we do not expect to fall within the scope of these requirements in the near term.\n \nWe may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income, sales and value-added or other taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period for which a determination is made.",
