      "text": "Item 1.Business\nOVERVIEW\nAmkor is the world’s largest U.S. headquartered OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test) service provider. Since its founding in 1968, Amkor has pioneered the outsourcing of integrated circuit (“IC”) packaging and test services and is a strategic manufacturing partner for the world’s leading semiconductor companies, foundries, and electronics original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). Amkor provides turnkey manufacturing services for the communication, computing, automotive and industrial and consumer markets, including smartphones, data centers, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and wearables. Amkor’s operational base includes production facilities, research and development centers and sales and support offices located in key electronics manufacturing regions in Asia, Europe and the United States. Amkor has built a leading position by:\n•Designing and developing innovative packaging and test technologies focused on advanced packaging solutions in high growth markets, including artificial intelligence;\n•Building expertise in high-volume manufacturing processes and developing a reputation for high quality and solid execution; \n•Cultivating long-standing relationships with our customers and industry partners;\n•Focusing on strategic end markets that offer solid growth potential;\n•Providing a geographically diverse operating base with manufacturing facilities in multiple countries across Asia and in Europe; and\n•Developing a competitive cost structure through disciplined capital investment.\nOur packaging and test services are designed to meet application and chip-specific requirements, including: the required type of interconnect technology; size; thickness; and electrical, mechanical and thermal performance. We provide turnkey packaging and test services including wafer bump, wafer probe, wafer back-grind, package design, packaging, system-level and final test and drop shipment services. Our customers use us for one or more of these services.\nWe provide our services to integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”), “fabless” semiconductor companies, OEMs and contract foundries. IDMs generally design, manufacture, package and test semiconductors in their own facilities. However, the availability of technologically advanced outsourced manufacturing services has encouraged IDMs to outsource a portion of their manufacturing. By offering a broad package portfolio, Amkor allows IDMs to outsource packaging and test services and focus their investments on core competencies such as silicon fabrication. Fabless semiconductor companies do not have factories. They focus exclusively on semiconductor design and outsource virtually every step of the manufacturing process, utilizing contract foundries to manufacture their semiconductors in wafer form and companies such as Amkor for their packaging and test needs. Some companies will engage a contract foundry to manage the complete semiconductor manufacturing process, and, in turn, the contract foundry will outsource some of its packaging and test needs.\nINDUSTRY BACKGROUND\nSemiconductor devices are essential building blocks used in most electronic products. As electronic and semiconductor devices have evolved, several important trends have emerged that have fueled the growth of the overall semiconductor industry, as well as the market for outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services. These trends include:\n•Adoption of artificial intelligence applications within data centers and edge devices such as smartphones, autonomous vehicles and consumer and industrial devices.\n•Growing demand for mobile and connected devices, including the worldwide adoption of smartphones, tablets and other Internet-of-Things (“IoT”) devices that can access the internet and provide multimedia capabilities.\n•An increase in the semiconductor content within electronic products to provide greater functionality and higher levels of performance.\n•The expansion of 5G infrastructure and 5G enabled devices.\n•The proliferation of semiconductor devices into well-established end products such as automotive systems for automation and driver assist, electrification and infotainment systems.\n•An increase in mobility and connectivity capabilities, driving demand for new broadband wired and wireless networking equipment.\n•Digitalization, driving expansion of data generation and storage. \n•The adoption of heterogeneous integration (diverse dies positioned close to each other within the same package) to reduce cost, improve yields and deliver required performance in data center computing, artificial intelligence and similar end uses. \n•The growth of advanced system-in-package (“SiP”) modules (combining multiple semiconductor and other electronic components in a single package) to meet the demand for miniaturization and higher functionality at competitive cost. \n•The increase in digital format in our environment, from sensors for automobiles (e.g., pressure, radar, LiDAR and image recognition), mobile devices (e.g., 3D motion, temperature, acceleration and imaging), and IoT (e.g., in-home sensing from temperature to weather and wearables).\nAs a supplier in the semiconductor industry, our business is cyclical and impacted by broad economic factors, such as worldwide gross domestic product and consumer spending. With the exception of 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic caused worldwide gross domestic product levels to decline during a period of strong growth in the semiconductor industry, there has generally been a strong correlation between worldwide gross domestic product levels, consumer spending and semiconductor industry cycles. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged cyclical upturns and downturns in the past. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any correction, economic slowdown, recession or subsequent economic recovery. \nOutsourcing Trends in Semiconductor Manufacturing\nSemiconductor companies outsource their packaging and test needs to service providers such as Amkor for the following reasons:\nPackaging and test service providers have developed expertise in advanced technologies.\nThe increasing demands for miniaturization, greater functionality, lower power consumption and improved thermal and electrical performance are driving the continuous development of semiconductor packaging and test technologies that are more sophisticated, complex, capital intensive and customized. This trend has led many semiconductor companies and OEMs to view packaging and test as enabling technologies that can benefit from the technological innovation expertise found in the leading outsourced assembly and test companies. At the same time, these companies are often looking to reduce their internal manufacturing and research and development costs for packaging and test solutions. As a result, many of these companies are increasingly relying on packaging and test service providers as key sources for new package designs and advanced interconnect technologies. \nPackaging and test service providers can facilitate a more efficient supply chain and help shorten time-to-market for new products.\nWe believe that semiconductor companies, together with their customers, are seeking to shorten the time-to-market for new products and that an efficient supply chain is a critical factor in facilitating timely and successful product introductions. Packaging and test service providers have the resources and expertise to timely develop and implement new packaging technology in high volume. For this reason, semiconductor companies and OEMs are leveraging the capabilities of outsourced packaging and test service providers to bring new high quality products to market more quickly.\nHigh quality packaging and test service providers enable semiconductor manufacturers to focus their resources on semiconductor design and wafer fabrication.\nAs semiconductor process technology migrates to larger wafers and smaller feature sizes, the cost of building a state-of-the-art wafer fabrication factory has risen significantly. The high cost of investing in next generation silicon technology and equipment is causing many semiconductor companies to adopt or maintain a “fabless” or “fab-lite” strategy to reduce or eliminate their investment in wafer fabrication and associated packaging and test operations. As a result, these companies are increasing their reliance on outsourced providers of semiconductor manufacturing services, including high quality packaging and test solutions.\nPackaging and test service providers offer a cost-effective solution in a cyclical, capital intensive industry.\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical by nature and impacted by broad economic factors, such as changes in worldwide gross domestic product and consumer spending. Semiconductor packaging and test are complex processes requiring substantial investment in specialized equipment, factories and human capital. As a result of this cyclicality and the large investments required, manufacturing facilities must operate at consistently high levels of utilization to be cost-effective. Shorter product life cycles, coupled with the need to update or replace packaging and test equipment to accommodate new package types, make it more difficult for IDMs to maintain cost-effective utilization of their packaging and test assets throughout semiconductor industry cycles. Packaging and test service providers, on the other hand, can typically use their assets to support a broad range of customers and multiple end markets, potentially generating more efficient use of their production assets and a more cost-effective solution.\nSTRATEGY AND COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS\nStrategy\nAmkor is a leader in advanced packaging technology in the outsourced semiconductor assembly and test market. Growth in the semiconductor industry is being driven primarily by advanced packaging within the secular growth markets of high-performance computing (“HPC”), automotive, IoT and mobile communications. We believe Amkor is well positioned in each of these end markets. \n•HPC supporting artificial intelligence and increasing demand for improved networking speed and storage within data centers, cloud computing, PCs and laptops, are driving demand for more semiconductors and advanced packaging in the computing end market.\n•Increasing semiconductor content in automobiles is driving increased demand for advanced packaging to enable the proliferation of safety features such as advanced driver assistance systems (“ADAS”) and radar and digital cockpit features such as infotainment displays and telematics. Increasing battery voltage, higher voltage power converters, onboard chargers, automotive inverter components and microcontrollers also require innovative power packaging solutions.\n•IoT wearables within the consumer end market are evolving in multiple applications, such as hearables, watches and augmented reality and virtual reality devices. Integration of multiple functions into small form factors, such as processors, sensors and connectivity devices, relies on innovation in advanced packaging.\n•Within the communications end market, we have a strong position across multiple device functionalities within premium and high tier smartphones. We are collaborating with industry leaders as smartphones transition to include artificial intelligence and drive semiconductor growth through the adoption of new wireless standards, integration of a broad range of applications, enhanced features, and higher performance requirements to support increased data processing. The trend to greater functionality drives miniaturization and innovation enabled by advanced packaging. \nOur primary financial objective is profitable sales growth. We believe that we will continue to achieve that goal and create long-term shareholder value by building on our strength in advanced packaging and executing on the following strategies.\nLeverage Our Leadership in Services for Advanced Technologies\nWe are an industry leader in developing and commercializing advanced packaging and test technologies, which we believe provide substantial value to our customers. \nWe have dedicated employees engaged in research and development for new semiconductor packaging and test technologies, making us a technology leader in areas such as 2.5D, advanced flip chip, fine pitch bumping, wafer-level processing, advanced SiPs and power modules.\nWe work closely with our customers to develop cost-effective leading-edge packages for the next generation of devices. These include integrated technologies such as advanced SiP, wafer-level fan-out (“WLFO”), Silicon Photonics (“SiPh”) and Co-Package Optics (“CPO”), Silicon Wafer Integrated Fan-out Technology (“SWIFT”), High Density Fan-Out (“HDFO”) and redistribution layer (“RDL”) solutions which enable very thin, very small products that combine application processors, memory, baseband and other peripheral ICs. Our advanced packages may utilize Through Silicon Via (“TSV”) interconnects and silicon interposers, which enable the integration of high-performance chips such as high bandwidth memory and graphics processors into a single package, such as 2.5D. In addition, we co-develop with customers high power modules incorporating gallium nitride (“GaN”) and silicon carbide (“SiC”) based devices. Our approach is to work with lead customers to develop processes that will enable volume manufacturing with high yields and reliability.\nWe believe that demand for advanced packaging services will continue to grow as our customers and leading electronics OEMs strive for smaller device geometries, higher levels of integration and performance and lower power consumption. We intend to continue to leverage our investment in advanced technology to meet the demand for these services in high growth markets.\nSelectively Grow Our Geographically Diverse Footprint through Strategic Investments \nWe aim to strengthen our leadership position and market share through strategic investment in our geographically diverse manufacturing footprint. We believe our broad geographic footprint provides customers with multiple options to mitigate risk and diversify their supply chains. For example, in 2024, we began delivering advanced SiP and memory packages from the Vietnam Facility and acquired the land for our planned Arizona Facility, where construction is expected to begin in the second half of 2025. In addition, our manufacturing presence in Portugal and our headquarters in the United States are key differentiators for us and position us to participate in initiatives to regionalize supply chains. We believe that selective growth through these strategic actions can further strengthen customer relationships, help to maintain and enhance our technological leadership, diversify our revenue streams and improve our profits.\nOptimize Utilization of Existing Assets \nAnother key factor in our success is the optimization of asset utilization. We build and utilize manufacturing lines which support multiple customers, and we increase factory utilization through sophisticated planning processes and intensive efficiency improvement activities.\nCompetitive Strengths\nThe outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive. We also compete with the internal semiconductor packaging and test capabilities of many of our customers, foundries and contract manufacturers. We believe we are well-positioned in the outsourced packaging and test services market. The following competitive strengths support our strategy to build upon our industry position and remain a preferred provider of semiconductor packaging and test services.\nAdvanced Packaging Technology Leadership\nWe are a leader in developing and deploying advanced semiconductor packaging and test solutions. We have designed and developed several state-of-the-art package formats and technologies such as Double-Sided, Molded Ball Grid Array (“DSMBGA”) SiP and 2.5D. 2.5D technology utilizes high density silicon interposers to enable the integration of high-performance chips, such as high bandwidth memory and graphics processors, into a single package. In addition, we believe that as semiconductor technology continues to achieve smaller device geometries with higher levels of integration, speed and performance, packages will increasingly require wafer-level Chip Scale Packaging (“CSP”), \nWLFO, SWIFT and flip chip interconnect solutions, advanced SiP products and medium and higher power density packages and modules. \nWe are committed to advancing our key processes and packages, as well as developing innovative test solutions, required for our customers to deliver advanced integrated and modular solutions to their respective markets. We are also committed to environmental responsibility by creating more sustainable IC packaging. This involves minimizing the use of harmful materials like lead and optimizing energy and water usage.\nBroad Offering of Semiconductor Package Design, Packaging and Test Services\nCreating successful interconnect solutions for advanced semiconductor devices often poses unique thermal, electrical and mechanical design challenges, and we employ a large number of engineers to solve these challenges. This wide variety of packaging offerings is necessary to meet the diverse needs of our customers for the optimal combination of performance, size and cost. Utilizing Amkor for its innovative packaging, test and design services enables our customers to focus their resources on semiconductor design and wafer fabrication. \nWe also offer an extensive line of advanced probe and final test services for analog, digital, logic, mixed signal, memory, sensors and radio frequency-semiconductor devices. We believe that the breadth of our design, packaging and test services is important to customers who seek to limit the number of their suppliers.\nGeographically Diversified Manufacturing Base\nWe have a broad and geographically diverse manufacturing footprint strategically located in eight of the world’s important electronics manufacturing regions. We believe that our scale and scope allow us to provide a flexible supply chain and cost-effective solutions to our customers by:\n•Being located in key regions where customers are actively seeking to develop localized supply chains;\n•Qualifying production of customer devices at multiple manufacturing sites with geographical diversity to mitigate the risks of supply disruptions;\n•Providing capabilities and solutions for customer-specific requirements;\n•Offering capacity to absorb large orders and accommodate quick turn-around times; and\n•Obtaining favorable pricing and supply agreements on materials and equipment by using our purchasing power and leading industry position.\nLong-Standing Relationships and Collaboration with Prominent Semiconductor Companies\nOur customers include most of the world’s largest semiconductor companies, and over the last five decades we have developed long-standing relationships with many of these companies. We believe that our production excellence, including high quality, reliability and predictability, has been a key factor in our success in attracting and retaining customers. We work with our customers and our suppliers to develop proprietary process technologies to enhance our existing capabilities, reduce time-to-market, improve quality and lower costs.\nWe believe that our focus on research and product development will enable us to enter new markets early, capture market share and promote the adoption of new package formats. We collaborate with customers and leading OEMs to develop comprehensive packaging solutions that make it easier for next-generation semiconductors to be designed into next-generation end products. By collaborating with leading semiconductor companies, foundries and OEM electronics companies, we are able to focus resources on developing new packages that will meet the requirements of new products. The traditional delineation between front-end semiconductor manufacturing and packaging is starting to converge. Foundries, and in some cases IDMs, are integrating some packaging activities closer to front-end wafer processes. We work closely with foundry partners to complement these offerings by offering similar wafer-based technologies as well as downstream processing.\nPACKAGING AND TEST SERVICES\nIn general, the semiconductor manufacturing process consists of IC design, wafer fabrication, wafer probe, packaging and final test. The packaging and test services we provide occur subsequent to wafer fabrication, and the wafers that we receive from our customers are generally consigned to us.\nAdvanced Products and Mainstream Products\nWe offer a broad range of advanced and mainstream packaging and test services to our customers. We refer to our flip chip, wafer-level processing and related test services as “Advanced Products” and to our wirebond packaging, power device packaging and related test services as “Mainstream Products.” The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, net sales for Advanced Products and Mainstream Products and the percentage of total net sales for each service offering.\n\n                                                                                                                                         For the Year Ended December 31,\n2024                                                                                                            2023                                                2022\n                                                                                                                           (In millions, except percentage of net sales)\nAdvanced Products             $5,175                    81.9   %                  $5,033                    77.4   %                  $5,368                    75.7   %\nMainstream Products            1,143                    18.1   %                   1,470                    22.6   %                   1,724                    24.3   %\nTotal net sales               $6,318                   100.0   %                  $6,503                   100.0   %                  $7,092                   100.0   %\nAdvanced Products\nOur Advanced Products include flip chip chip scale packages (“FC CSP”), wafer-level packages and flip chip ball grid array (“FCBGA”) packages. These package families use flip chip interconnect technology so that the die can be connected to a substrate package carrier or, in the case of wafer-level chip scale packages, directly to a printed circuit board.\nFC CSP Products: FC CSP packages are small form factor packages where the substrate size is not much larger than the die itself. FC CSP can be a single die or multi die format. The size advantage provided by CSP technologies has made FC CSP an attractive choice for a wide variety of applications that require very small form factors, such as smartphones, tablets and other mobile consumer electronic devices.\nFlip chip stacked chip scale packages (“FC SCSP”) stack a second die on top of the original flip-chip die. The top die is typically a memory device, and wirebond interconnects are used to attach the top die to the substrate. FC SCSP is frequently used to stack memory on top of digital baseband and applications processors for use in mobile devices.\nWe continue to drive thinner package solutions for our Package on Package (“PoP”) technology through the development of ultra-thin substrates and enhancing our pre-stacking and thin die handling capabilities.\nWe developed fine pitch copper pillar flip chip interconnect technology, which creates interconnections at finer pitches using a plating process to reduce the number of substrate layers to facilitate very thin packages. This innovative solution is also an enabling technology for package stacking with TSVs.\nFCBGA Products: FCBGA packages are large form factor substrate-based packages which are used where processing power and speed are a higher priority than a small form factor. Our FCBGA packages are assembled using state-of-the-art substrates. Utilizing multiple high density routing layers, laser drilled vias, and ultra-fine line and space metallization, FCBGA substrates have the highest routing density available. The variety of FCBGA package options, from large single die to multi-chip packages with memory, allows package selection to be tailored to the specific thermal needs of the end product. We offer FCBGA packaging in a variety of product formats to fit a wide range of end application requirements, including networking, storage, computing, automotive and consumer applications. Some FCBGA products incorporate 2.5D technology, which utilizes high density silicon interposers to enable the integration of high-performance chips, such as high bandwidth memory and graphics processors, into a single package. \nMemory Products: Memory packages consist of either standalone packaging and testing or a combination of NAND Flash, DRAM, or a memory controller IC using a variety of packaging technologies, including FC, SCSP, SiP, PoP and \nother state-of-the-art packaging technologies. These products are used as system memory or platform data storage in all of our end markets. \nWafer-level Package Products: We offer three types of wafer-level packages: wafer-level CSP; WLFO; SiPh and CPO; and SWIFT. Wafer-level CSP and WLFO are complementary technologies. Customers can choose between the two package types as their die sizes shrink or grow.\n•Wafer-level CSP packages (also known as fan-in wafer-level packages) do not utilize a package carrier. The bumped wafer is singulated into individual die, and the wafer-level package is then attached directly to the system board. Wafer-level CSP offers one of the lowest total system costs, enabling higher semiconductor content while leveraging the smallest form factor and one of the highest performing, most reliable semiconductor package platforms on the market today. Applications for wafer-level CSP include power management, transceivers, sensors, wireless charging, codecs, and specialty silicon for new or unique functionality.\n•WLFO packages (also known as low-density fan-out packages) are utilized for ICs where the die surface area is too small to accommodate all of the required bond pads. The fan-out package enlarges the bondable surface area by building a border around the die using low-cost molding compound. These packages can include multiple die. Applications for WLFO packages include power management, transceivers, radar and specialty silicon.\n•SiPh and CPO allow for the integration of fiberoptic interconnects both within a package and within the server architecture to reduce power consumption, heat generation and improve performance. Amkor has supported previous generations of SiPh packaging needs and is aligned with the market to support its future needs, through chip on wafer, chip on chip and other advanced packaging solutions. \n•SWIFT, also known as high-density fan-out, can either replace the laminate substrate with a thinner structure or reduce the complexity of the substrate by housing the dense interconnects in the SWIFT structure, allowing for a less expensive substrate that provides a high level of performance with a balanced cost structure. SWIFT solutions enable high performance in a compact form factor that combines tiled processors, memory, I/O (input/output) die and other peripheral ICs.\nMainstream Products\nOur Mainstream Products use wirebond interconnect technology to connect a die to a leadframe or substrate package carrier and include leadframe packages, substrate-based wirebond packages and micro-electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”) packages.\nLeadframe Packages: Leadframe packages use wirebond or flip chip technology to connect a die to a leadframe package carrier. Leadframe packages are used in many electronic devices and remain the most practical and cost-effective solution for many low to medium pin count analog and mixed signal applications.\nTraditional leadframe packages support a wide variety of device types and applications. Two of our most popular traditional leadframe package types are small outline IC and quad flat package, commonly known as “dual” and “quad” products, respectively, based upon the number of sides from which the leads extend. The traditional leadframe package family has evolved from “through hole design,” where the leads are plugged into holes on the circuit board to “surface mount design,” where the leads are soldered to the surface of the circuit board. We offer a wide range of lead counts and body sizes to satisfy variations in the size of customers’ semiconductor devices.\nThrough a process of continuous engineering and customization, we have designed several leadframe package types that are thinner and smaller than traditional leadframe packages and can accommodate more leads on the perimeter of the package. These leadframe packages typically have superior thermal and electrical characteristics, which allow them to dissipate heat generated by high-powered semiconductor devices while providing enhanced electrical connectivity. We are developing increasingly smaller versions of these packages to keep pace with continually shrinking semiconductor device sizes and demand for miniaturization of portable electronic products. One of our more successful leadframe package offerings is the MicroLeadFrame family of quad flat no lead packages. These packages offer cost effective, miniaturized solutions for multiple analog power and signal chain applications. \nPower discrete devices use a leadframe as the package carrier and primarily use wirebond interconnect technology. However, power applications that require improved thermal and electrical performance will use packaging with copper clip interconnect technology that creates multi die power modules with wafers from silicon carbide and other wide band gap materials.\nSubstrate-based Wirebond Packages: Substrate-based wirebond packages use wirebond technology to connect a die to a substrate. Some of our packages in this category include stacked CSP, wirebond ball grid array packages and plastic ball grid array (“PBGA”) packages.\nStacked CSP technology enables the stacking of a wide range of different semiconductor devices to deliver high levels of silicon integration and area efficiency. Stacked CSP utilizes high density thin core substrates and advanced materials, along with leading-edge wafer thinning, die attach and molding capabilities, to stack multiple die on a substrate. Stacked CSP is ideal for memory and mixed signal applications.\nWirebond ball grid array packages offer a broad selection of ball array pitches, ball counts and body sizes, single and multi-die layouts, stacked die and passive component integration together with thermal management solutions. They are applicable for a wide range of semiconductors requiring a smaller package size than conventional PBGAs or leadframe packages.\nPBGA packages are used in applications requiring higher pin count than leadframe packages, but typically have lower pin counts than flip chip. PBGA packages are designed for low inductance, improved thermal operation and enhanced surface-mount technology ability. Custom performance enhancements, like ground and power planes, are also available.\nMicro-Electro-Mechanical Systems Packages: MEMS are miniaturized mechanical and electro-mechanical devices that can sense and provide information about the physical world and sometimes trigger a response. Examples of MEMS devices include microphones, accelerometers, airbag deployment sensors, gyrometers, magnetometers and humidity, temperature and pressure sensors. We also specialize in sensor fusion products which utilize our cavity MEMS platform and combine multiple sensors into a single package. MEMS packages leverage our expertise in wafer thinning, die stacking, wirebonding and flip chip interconnect to deliver sophisticated products with a very small form factor. \nAdvanced System-in-Package Modules\nAdvanced SiP modules combine multiple semiconductor and other electronic components with different functionalities into a single package. These modules use wirebond, flip chip or wafer-level interconnect technologies. Components can include ICs, passive devices (inductors, capacitors, resistors, filters and diplexers), antennas and mechanical parts.\nThe increasing demand for miniaturization and higher functionality at competitive cost is driving the adoption of advanced SiP in new products. Advanced SiP modules are used for many applications such as radio frequency (“RF”) and front-end modules, basebands, connectivity, fingerprint sensors, display and touch screen drivers, sensors and MEMS, NAND memory and solid state drives. Advanced SiP modules are found in many products including smartphones and tablets, automobiles, IoT wearables, high-performance gaming systems, computers and network systems. \nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had net sales of approximately $3,085 million, $2,955 million and $2,930 million, respectively, from our advanced SiP modules, which are mostly included in Advanced Products, depending upon the interconnect technology used in the module. \nTest Services\nOur Test Services complement our wafer and packaging services across our Advanced and Mainstream Products. Our test services offer customers the cycle time and cost advantages of co-located turn-key services. Our test services are used as both an interim step or as the final testing step to ensure screening and rejection of defects, performance grading and overall outgoing quality and reliability. Interim testing eliminates the manufacturing costs of assembling the defective chips. Below is a description of our test services: \nWafer Level Test: Wafer level test is a manufacturing step performed while a wafer is still in its full form and before being singulated for further package processing. \nPackage Level Test: Package level test is performed on a product or products that have been assembled in a package.\nBurn-In Test: Burn-in test is a process in which components of a system are exercised, monitored and measured in extreme operational conditions such as high temperature, voltage and frequency over time. The purpose of the environmental and operational stress conditions of burn-in testing is to accelerate and screen early life failures and estimate and monitor long-term degradation and ultimate lifetime.\nSystem Level Test: System level test identifies defective SiP products that may not otherwise be screened by traditional wafer level, package level or burn-in testing. As advanced packaging proliferates and the integration of more individual components into a SiP grows, system level testing becomes more important.\nTest Development Services: Prior to mass production, an integrated manufacturing ready test solution must be developed and deployed.

Our research efforts focus on developing new packaging solutions and test services, as well as improving the efficiency and capabilities of our existing production processes. By concentrating our research and development on our customers’ needs for innovative packaging solutions for increased performance, higher density, smaller size and lower cost, we gain opportunities to enter markets early and compete for new business.\nA significant area of focus is on integrated multi-die solutions, including 2.5D, SWIFT and S-Connect. These multi-chip modules and high-density WLFO solutions enable package level integration of different types and levels of silicon technologies for high performance computing, networking and data center applications. This is accomplished by combining processors and other chiplets into one packaged module. Through die partitioning and heterogeneous integration, these modules provide higher functionality at lower total product cost. \nAnother important priority is the development of wafer-level and panel-level packages for 2D and 3D implementations. These wafer-level chip-scale packages and WLFO packages are increasingly the preferred package type for many applications in IoT and mobile devices, including processors, power management integrated circuits (“PMICs”), display drivers and antenna package products. Our development of Panel Level Fan Out (“PLFO”) technology will permit higher economies of scale for fan-out package devices manufactured on a panel versus wafer basis. \nAnother key area is developing highly integrated SiP modules, such as DSMBGA or double-sided molded land grid array packages, to reduce material and processing costs and minimize form factor for wearables and mobile devices. \nWe are also developing new applications for the automotive market using existing and new package technologies as higher performance computing, energy efficiency, power distribution and sensor content are used to support new \nautomotive features including ADAS, infotainment, optical sensors and electric vehicles. In addition, we are developing high power modules involving SiC-based devices.\nOur research and development employees are based in Korea, Portugal, the United States and other locations in Asia. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred $163.0 million, $177.5 million and $149.4 million, respectively, of research and development expense. \nSALES AND MARKETING\nOur sales offices are located throughout Asia, Europe and the United States. Our support personnel manage and promote our packaging and test services and provide key customer and technical support. To provide comprehensive sales and customer service, we typically assign our customers a direct support team consisting of a sales manager, assembly and test technical program managers and both field and factory customer support representatives. We also support our largest multinational customers from multiple office locations to ensure that we are aligned with their global operational and business requirements.\nOur direct support teams are further supported by an extended staff of product, process, quality and reliability engineers, as well as marketing and advertising specialists, information systems technicians and factory personnel. Together, these direct and extended support teams deliver an array of services to our customers. \nSEASONALITY\nOur sales have generally been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half due to consumer buying patterns in the U.S., Europe and Asia and the timing of flagship mobile device launches. In addition, semiconductor companies generally reduce their production during the holidays at the end of December, which generally results in a decrease in packaging and test services during the first quarter. General economic conditions, changes in our product mix or overall demand in any of our end markets can impact our seasonality.\nCUSTOMERS\nOur customers include many of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Our ten largest customers accounted for 72% of our net sales in 2024. Direct sales to Apple and Qualcomm accounted for 30.8% and 10.2% of our net sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nMATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT\nMaterials\nOur materials are used primarily for packaging activities. Our packaging operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis. The principal materials used in our packaging process are laminate substrates, ICs, capacitors, leadframes and gold wire. The silicon wafer is generally consigned from our customer. We generally do not take ownership of the customer consigned wafer, and title and risk of loss remains with the customer for these materials. Test materials constitute a very small portion of our total test cost. Generally, we purchase materials based on Amkor’s commitments to customer forecasts, and our customers are generally responsible for any unused materials we purchase based on such commitments. \nWe obtain the materials required for packaging services from various suppliers and source most of our materials, including critical materials such as leadframes, laminate substrates and gold wire, from a limited group of suppliers. We work closely with our primary material suppliers to ensure consistent quality, availability and timely delivery. We also negotiate worldwide pricing agreements with our major suppliers to take advantage of the scale of our operations.\nEquipment\nOur ability to meet the changing demand from our customers for manufacturing capacity depends upon obtaining packaging and test equipment in a timely manner. We work closely with our main equipment suppliers to coordinate the ordering and delivery of equipment to meet our expected capacity needs.\nThe primary types of equipment used in providing our packaging services are wirebonders, die bonders, chip shooters and die attach. In addition, we maintain a variety of other packaging equipment, including mold, singulation, ball attach \nand wafer backgrind, along with numerous other types of manufacturing equipment. A substantial portion of our packaging equipment base can generally be used and adapted to support the manufacture of many of our packages.\nWe also purchase wafer bumping equipment to facilitate our flip chip and wafer level packaging services such as 2.5D and HDFO, which is used for HPC and artificial intelligence systems. Wafer bumping equipment includes sputter and spin coaters, electroplating equipment, reflow ovens and other types of equipment. This equipment tends to have longer lead times for delivery and installation than other packaging equipment and is sold in relatively larger increments of capacity.\nThe primary equipment used in the testing process includes testers, handlers and probers. Handlers are used to transfer individual or small groups of packaged ICs to a tester. Test equipment is generally a more capital-intensive activity than packaging, and test equipment tends to have longer delivery lead times than most types of packaging equipment. We focus our capital expenditures on standardized tester platforms to maximize test equipment utilization where possible. In some cases, our customers will consign test equipment to us. \nGOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS \nAs a public company with global operations, we are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations. These regulations, which differ among jurisdictions, include financial and other external reporting disclosure rules, accounting standards and environmental, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel, privacy and anti-corruption laws. Costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are presently not material to our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our operations, services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for compliance with government regulations. \nEnvironmental Matters\nWe use chemicals and materials in the semiconductor packaging process that generate byproducts such as wastewater, solid waste and flue gas. For example, water used for rinsing or cooling wafers being sawed or used in the etching or solder deposition process produces wastewater. Scrap from metal lead-frame or substrate processing or excessive molding resin produces solid waste. Emissions from solvents used for coating produce flue gases. In addition to byproducts, semiconductor packages have historically contained lead, a naturally occurring element that can be toxic. The use of lead in our packages has decreased over time due to the use of lead-free alternatives. The use and storage of chemicals and materials are subject to various laws and regulations governing waste disposal, water discharge, emissions into the atmosphere and employee health and safety. We make continuous efforts to comply with these environmental laws and regulations, including environmental management systems, safety training for employees and pollution control at our factories.\nIn the future, we may be subject to changes to existing environmental regulations or new green initiatives required by our customers, investors, governments or other stakeholders. We do not believe that capital expenditures or other costs attributable to compliance with environmental laws and regulations or green initiatives will have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. \nCOMPETITION\nThe outsourced semiconductor packaging and test market is highly competitive, geopolitical trade tensions have increased competition from Chinese firms supporting a China-for-China supply chain. We face competition from established packaging and test service providers primarily located in Asia, including ASE Technology, JCET Group and Powertech Technology.\nAdditionally, we compete with contract foundries, such as TSMC, and electronic manufacturing service providers or contract electronics manufacturers, including Universal Scientific Industrial and Luxshare, which offer certain types of advanced packaging. Our IDM customers also evaluate our services and scale against their own in-house capabilities. \nThe key competitive factors in the outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services market are:\n•Advanced packaging technology\n•Geographic location of services\n•Manufacturing scale and expertise\n•Customer co-development and innovation \n\n•Investment in new technology and capacity\n•Quality and reliability\n•Price\n•Cycle time\n\n\nWe believe we are competitive in these areas.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe maintain an active program to protect and derive value from our investment in technology and the associated intellectual property rights. Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and other countries, and their durations vary depending on the jurisdiction in which each patent is filed. Although our patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy, we are not materially dependent on any one patent or any one technology. We expect to continue to file patent applications when appropriate to protect our proprietary technologies, but we cannot provide assurances that we will receive patents from pending or future applications. In addition, any patents we obtain could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and may not provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantage to us. Nonetheless, we believe that our patents afford an important means of protection for our technologies. Further, to distinguish our products from our competitors’ products, we have obtained certain trademarks and service marks and may promote our particular brands through advertising and other marketing techniques.\nWe also protect and maintain the confidentiality of certain information about our processes, products and strategies which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. We have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. As part of these efforts, all employees who have access to Amkor’s information systems are required to participate in cybersecurity training within the first 15 days of employment, after which recurring mandatory training is required on an annual basis. \nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAmkor believes that its future success is highly dependent upon our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. As part of our effort to attract and motivate employees, Amkor is committed to providing competitive and comprehensive benefits that are designed to enable our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Additionally, Amkor has implemented various retention programs to incentivize and retain high-performing employees. We regularly evaluate such retention programs and our compensation practices generally to ensure they remain competitive and are aligned with local market practices. We look to promote our management-level employees from within Amkor, and we believe that we have been successful in this effort. Factory locations also maintain training and development programs that enable the continued learning and growth of our employees, and senior management regularly meets to share and implement best practices among our various facilities. \nAmkor also uses human capital initiatives to support our broad geographic footprint. For career development and advancement, we may provide employees with the opportunity to move between factories, often in support of new factories or the introduction of new packaging offerings. We believe that these initiatives are efficient for training new local employees and allow existing employees to continue to develop in their careers.\nWe believe that our efforts to motivate, retain and support the growth of qualified employees is reflected in the long average tenure of many of our key employees. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Amkor employed 28,300 employees, of whom approximately 96%, 3% and 1% resided in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe and the United States, respectively. Our global workforce spans 12 countries, reflecting various cultures, backgrounds, ages, genders and ethnicities. Our employees in France, Germany, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and the United States are not represented by any union. Certain employees at our factories in China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Portugal and Vietnam are members of a union, and we operate subject to collective bargaining agreements that we have entered into with these unions. We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have not experienced a work stoppage in any of our factories.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nAmkor files annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website that contains annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information that issuers (including Amkor) file electronically with the SEC.

      "text": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nThe factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. For more information, see the Forward-Looking Statements within this Form 10-K. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Amkor. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations. The occurrence of any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves various risks, and you are urged to carefully consider all of the matters discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the caption “Risk Factors” (in addition to those discussed under this “Summary of Risk Factors” section) in considering our business and prospects. The following is a list of some of these risks: \nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry\n•dependence on the cyclical and volatile semiconductor industry and vulnerability to industry downturns and declines in global economic and financial conditions;\n•changes in costs, quality, availability and delivery times of raw materials, components and equipment;\n•fluctuations in operating results and cash flows;\n•competition with established competitors in the packaging and test business, the internal capabilities of IDMs, and new competitors, including foundries and contract manufacturers; \n•our substantial investments in equipment and facilities to support the demand of our customers;\n•warranty claims, product return and liability risks, and the risk of negative publicity if our products fail, as well as the risk of litigation incident to our business;\n•difficulty achieving the relatively high-capacity utilization rates necessary to realize satisfactory gross margins given our high percentage of fixed costs;\n•our absence of backlog and the short-term nature of our customers’ commitments;\n•the historical downward pressure on the prices of our packaging and test services;\n•fluctuations in our manufacturing yields;\n•a downturn or lower sales to customers in the automotive industry;\n•dependence on key customers or concentration of customers in certain end markets, such as mobile communications and automotive;\n•difficulty funding our liquidity needs; and\n•challenges with integrating diverse operations.\nRisks Related to Our International Sales and Operations\n•dependence on international factories and operations, and risks relating to trade restrictions and regional conflict.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property\n•our ability to develop new proprietary technology, protect our proprietary technology, operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and implement new technologies; and\n•our continuing development and implementation of changes to, and maintenance and security of, our information technology systems.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n•restrictive covenants in the indentures and agreements governing our current and future indebtedness;\n•our substantial indebtedness; and\n•fluctuations in interest rates and changes in credit risk. \nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n•the ability of certain of our stockholders to effectively determine or substantially influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval; and\n•the possibility that we may decrease or suspend our quarterly dividend.\nRisks Related to Human Capital and Management\n•difficulty attracting, retaining or replacing qualified personnel. \nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal and Tax Challenges\n•maintaining an effective system of internal controls; \n•any changes in tax laws, taxing authorities not agreeing with our interpretation of applicable tax laws, including whether we continue to qualify for conditional reduced tax rates, or any requirements to establish or adjust valuation allowances on deferred tax assets; \n•environmental, health and safety liabilities and expenditures; and\n•conditions and obligations in connection with the receipt of government awards and incentives.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n•natural disasters and other calamities, health conditions or pandemics, political instability, hostilities or other disruptions.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry\nOur packaging and test services are used in volatile industries, and industry downturns and declines in global economic and financial conditions could harm our performance. \nOur business is impacted by market conditions in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical by nature and impacted by broad economic factors, such as worldwide gross domestic product and consumer spending. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes sudden and prolonged downturns in the past. If the industry or markets in which we compete experience slower, or even negative growth, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nSince our business is, and will continue to be, dependent on the requirements of semiconductor companies for outsourced packaging and test services, any downturn in the semiconductor industry or any other industry that uses a significant \nnumber of semiconductor devices, such as communications, computing, automotive and industrial or consumer electronics, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. During downturns, we have experienced, among other things, reduced demand, excess capacity and reduced sales. For example, the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted demand in the automotive and industrial end market in 2020, and during 2019, there was weakness in the general market and an inventory correction in the smartphone market. \nOur business may suffer if the cost, quality or supply of materials or equipment changes adversely.\nWe obtain the materials and equipment required for the packaging and test services performed by our factories from various vendors. We source most of our materials, including critical materials such as leadframes, laminate substrates and gold wire, from a limited group of suppliers. A disruption to the operations of one or more of our suppliers could extend lead times for materials and equipment and have a negative impact on our business. For example, the Covid-19 pandemic and resulting supply chain disruptions and economic turbulence created extended lead times for some materials and equipment, and furthermore, fire, severe weather, earthquakes, flooding and tsunamis in the past have impacted the supply of specialty chemicals, substrates, silicon wafers, equipment and other supplies to the electronics industry. \nIn addition, we purchase the majority of our materials on a purchase order basis. Our business may be harmed if we cannot obtain materials and other supplies from our vendors in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities, at acceptable quality or at competitive prices or are unable to increase our prices sufficiently to recover inflationary price increases in materials or supplies. Some of our customers are also dependent on a limited number of suppliers for certain materials and silicon wafers. Shortages or disruptions in our customers’ supply channels, including any disruptions arising out of the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel or other future conflicts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \nSEC rules and related industry initiatives require diligence and disclosure regarding the use of certain minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Many of our customers’ initiatives require us to certify that the covered materials we use in our packages do not come from the conflict areas. We incur costs associated with complying with these requirements and customer initiatives, and we may be required to increase our efforts in the future to cover additional materials and geographic areas. These requirements and customer initiatives could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of materials used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain conflict-free materials or other materials covered by customer initiatives in sufficient quantities and at competitive prices or that we will be able to verify the origin of all of the materials we procure. If we are unable to meet these requirements and customer initiatives, some customers may move their business to other suppliers, and our reputation and business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe purchase new packaging and test equipment to maintain and expand our operations. From time to time, increased demand for new equipment or supply chain disruptions and economic turbulence may cause lead times to extend beyond those normally required by equipment vendors. In periods of increased demand and reduced availability, equipment suppliers may delay orders or only partially satisfy our equipment orders in the normal time frame. The unavailability of equipment or failures to deliver equipment on a timely basis could delay or impair our ability to meet customer orders. If we are unable to meet customer orders, we could lose potential and existing customers. Generally, we acquire our equipment on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term equipment agreements. As a result, depending on market conditions, we could experience adverse changes in pricing, currency risk and potential shortages in equipment, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are a large buyer of gold and other commodity materials, including substrates and copper. The prices of gold and other commodities used in our business fluctuate. Historically, we have been able to partially offset the effect of commodity price increases through price adjustments to some customers and changes in our product designs that reduce the material content and cost, such as the use of shorter, thinner gold wire and migration to copper wire. However, we typically do not have long-term contracts that permit us to impose price adjustments, and market conditions may limit our ability to do so. Significant price increases may materially and adversely impact our gross margin in future periods to the extent we are unable to pass along past or future commodity price increases to our customers.\nOur operating results and cash flows have varied and may vary significantly as a result of factors that we cannot control.\nMany factors could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, gross profit, operating results and cash flows or lead to significant variability of quarterly or annual operating results. Our profitability and ability to generate cash from operations is principally dependent upon demand for semiconductors, the utilization of our capacity, semiconductor package mix, the average selling price of our services, our ability to manage our capital expenditures and our ability to control our costs including labor, material, overhead and financing costs.\nOur net sales, gross margin, gross profit, operating income, net income and cash flows have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of many of the following factors, over which we have little or no control and which we expect to continue to impact our business:\n•fluctuations in demand for semiconductors and conditions in the semiconductor industry generally, as well as by specific customers, such as inventory reductions by our customers impacting demand in key markets;\n•changes in cost, quality, availability and delivery times of raw materials, components, equipment and labor;\n•inflation, including wage inflation, and fluctuations in commodity prices, including gold, copper and other precious metals;\n•our ability to achieve our major growth objectives, including transitioning second-wave customers to advanced packages and increasing our share of the automotive and industrial end market;\n•changes in our capacity and capacity utilization rates;\n•fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the current rising interest rate environment;\n•changes in average selling prices which can occur quickly due to the absence of long-term agreements on price;\n•changes in the mix of the semiconductor packaging and test services that we sell;\n•fluctuations in our manufacturing yields;\n•the development, transition and ramp to high volume manufacture of more advanced silicon nodes and evolving wafer, packaging and test technologies may cause production delays, lower manufacturing yields and supply constraints for new wafers and other materials;\n•the absence of backlog, the short-term nature of our customers’ commitments, double bookings by customers and deterioration in customer forecasts and the impact of these factors, including the possible delay, rescheduling and cancellation of large orders, or the timing and volume of orders relative to our production capacity;\n•the timing of expenditures in anticipation of future orders;\n•changes in effective tax rates;\n•the availability and cost of financing;\n•leverage and debt covenants;\n•intellectual property transactions and disputes;\n•warranty and product liability claims and the impact of quality excursions and customer disputes and returns;\n•costs associated with legal claims, indemnification obligations, judgments and settlements;\n•political instability, conflicts (such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel) and government shutdowns, civil disturbances and international events;\n•environmental or natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and volcanic eruptions;\n•pandemics or other widespread illnesses that may impact our labor force, operations, liquidity, supply chain and end-user demand for products which incorporate semiconductors;\n•costs of acquisitions and divestitures and difficulties integrating acquisitions;\n•our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to support our global operations;\n•our ability to penetrate new end markets or expand our business in existing end markets;\n•dependence on key customers or concentration of customers in certain end markets, such as mobile communications and automotive; and\n•restructuring charges, asset write-offs and impairments.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security announced new export control regulations applicable to the sale of U.S. semiconductor technology in China (collectively, the “BIS Regulations”). The above factors, in addition to the BIS Regulations and other similarly restrictive trade barriers adopted by U.S. and foreign governments applicable to the semiconductor supply chain, could impact our business and the businesses of our customers. These factors may have a material and adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or lead to significant volatility in our quarterly or annual operating results. In addition, these factors may materially and adversely affect our credit ratings, which could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise capital and could materially and adversely affect the price of our securities.\nWe compete against established competitors in the packaging and test business as well as internal capabilities of IDMs and face competition from new competitors, including foundries and contract manufacturers.\nThe outsourced semiconductor packaging and test services market is very competitive. We face substantial competition from established and emerging packaging and test service providers primarily located in Asia, including companies with significantly greater processing capacity, financial resources, local presence, research and development operations, marketing, technology and other capabilities. In addition, we may compete with electronics manufacturing service providers or contract electronics manufacturers that also provide advanced integrated device solutions. We also may face increased competition from domestic companies located in China, where there are government-supported efforts to promote and subsidize the development and growth of the local semiconductor industry. We may be at a disadvantage in attempting to compete with entities associated with such government-supported initiatives based on their lower cost of capital, access to government resources and incentives, preferential sourcing practices, stronger local relationships or otherwise. Our competitors may also have established relationships, or enter into new strategic relationships, with one or more of the large semiconductor companies that are our current or potential customers or key suppliers to these customers. Consolidation among our competitors could also strengthen their competitive position. \nHistorically, we have also been dependent on the trend in outsourcing of packaging and test services by IDM and foundry customers. Our IDM and foundry customers continually evaluate the need for outsourced services against their own in-house packaging and test services. As a result, at any time and for a variety of reasons, IDMs and foundries may decide to shift some or all of their outsourced packaging and test services to internally sourced capacity. To the extent we limit capacity commitments for certain customers, these customers may increase their level of in-house packaging and test capabilities, which could make it more difficult for us to regain their business when we have available capacity. If we experience a significant loss of IDM or foundry business, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, especially during a prolonged industry downturn. \nWe face competition from foundries, such as TSMC and Samsung, which offer full turnkey services from silicon wafer fabrication through packaging and final test. These foundries, which are substantially larger than us and have greater financial resources than we do, have expanded their operations to include packaging and test services and may continue to expand these capabilities in the future. If a key customer decides to purchase wafers from a semiconductor foundry that provides packaging and test services, our business could be adversely affected if the customer also engages that foundry for related packaging and test services. \nWe also face competition from contract manufacturers and electronic manufacturing service providers, many of which are larger than us, have lower cost structures, and may be willing or able to sell their services at lower margins. These competitors have increased and could increase pricing and competitive pressures. \nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors, that our customers will not rely on internal sources, foundries or contract manufacturers for packaging and \ntest services or that our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows will not be materially and adversely affected by such increased competition. \nWe make substantial investments in equipment and facilities to support the demand of our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our business if the demand of our customers does not develop as we expect or is adversely affected. \nWe make significant investments in equipment and facilities in order to service the demand of our customers. The amount of our capital expenditures depends on several factors, including the performance of our business, our assessment of future industry and customer demand, our capacity utilization levels and availability, advances in technology, our liquidity position and the availability of financing. Our ongoing capital expenditure requirements may strain our cash and liquidity, and, in periods when we are expanding our capital base, we expect that depreciation expense and factory operating expenses associated with capital expenditures to increase production capacity will put downward pressure on our gross profit, at least in the near term. From time to time, we also make significant capital expenditures based on specific business opportunities with one or a few key customers, and the additional equipment purchased may not be readily usable to support other customers. If demand is insufficient to fill our capacity, or we are unable to efficiently redeploy such equipment, our capacity utilization and gross profit could be negatively impacted. \nFurthermore, if we cannot generate or raise additional funds to pay for capital expenditures, particularly in some of the advanced packaging and bumping areas, as well as research and development activities, our growth and future profitability may be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to obtain external financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including: our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; general market conditions for financing; volatility in fixed income, credit and equity markets; and economic, political and other global conditions.\nIn October 2023, we completed the initial phase of construction for the Vietnam Facility. While manufacturing has begun at the Vietnam Facility, there can be no assurance that the actual scope, costs or benefits of the project will be consistent with our current expectations.\nWe may face warranty claims, product return and liability risks, economic damage claims and negative publicity if our packages fail.\nOur packages are incorporated into a number of end products. If our packages fail, our business may be exposed to warranty claims, product return and liability risks, economic damage claims and negative publicity. \nWe receive warranty claims from our customers from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. If we were to experience an unusually high incidence of warranty claims, we could incur significant costs and our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we are exposed to the product and economic liability risks and the risk of negative publicity affecting our customers. Our sales may decline if any of our customers are sued on a product liability claim. We also may suffer a decline in sales from the negative publicity associated with such a lawsuit or with adverse public perceptions in general regarding our customers’ products. Further, if our packages are delivered with defects, we could incur additional development, repair or replacement costs or suffer other economic losses, and our credibility and the market’s acceptance of our packages could be harmed.\nDue to our high percentage of fixed costs, we may be unable to maintain satisfactory gross margins if we are unable to achieve relatively high-capacity utilization rates.\nOur operations are characterized by high fixed costs and the absence of any material backlog. Our profitability depends in part not only on pricing levels for our packaging and test services but also on the efficient utilization of our human resources and packaging and test equipment. Increases or decreases in our capacity utilization can significantly affect gross margins. Transitions between different packaging technologies can also impact our capacity utilization if we do not efficiently redeploy our equipment for other packaging and test opportunities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve consistently high-capacity utilization, and if we fail to do so, our gross margins may be negatively impacted. \nIn addition, our fixed operating costs have increased as a result of capital expenditures for capacity expansion. The anticipated customer demand for which we have made capital investments may not materialize, and our sales may not \nadequately cover fixed costs, resulting in reduced profit levels or even significant losses, either of which may materially and adversely impact our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe lack of contractually committed customer demand may materially and adversely affect our sales.\nOur packaging and test business does not typically operate with any material backlog. Our quarterly net sales from packaging and test services are substantially dependent upon our customers’ demand in that quarter. Generally, our customers do not commit to purchase any significant amount of packaging or test services or provide us with binding forecasts of demand for packaging and test services for any future period, in any material amount. In addition, we sometimes experience double booking by customers, and our customers often reduce, cancel or delay their purchases of packaging and test services for a variety of reasons, including industry-wide, customer-specific and Amkor-specific reasons. This makes it difficult for us to forecast our capacity utilization and net sales in future periods. Since a large portion of our costs is fixed and our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future sales, we may not be able to adjust costs in a timely manner to compensate for any sales shortfall. If we are unable to adjust costs in a timely manner, our margins, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nHistorically, there has been downward pressure on the prices of our packaging and test services.\nPrices for packaging and test services have generally declined over time, and sometimes prices can change significantly in relatively short periods of time. We expect downward pressure on average selling prices for our packaging and test services to continue in the future, and this pressure may intensify during downturns in business. If we experience declining average selling prices and are unable to offset such declines by developing and marketing new packages with higher prices, reducing our purchasing costs, recovering more of our material cost increases from our customers and reducing our manufacturing costs, our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nPackaging and test processes are complex, and our production yields and customer relationships may suffer from defects in the services we provide or if we do not successfully implement new technologies. \nSemiconductor packaging and test services are complex processes that require significant technological and process expertise, and in line with industry practice, customers usually require us to pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process that may take several months. Once qualified and in production, defective packages primarily result from one or more of the following:\n•contaminants in the manufacturing environment;\n•human error;\n•equipment malfunction;\n•changing processes to address environmental requirements;\n•defective raw materials; or\n•defective plating services.\nTest is also complex and involves sophisticated equipment and software. Similar to many software programs, these software programs are complex and may contain programming errors or “bugs.” The test equipment is also subject to malfunction, and the test process is subject to operator error.\nThese and other factors have, from time to time, contributed to lower production yields. They may also do so in the future, particularly as we adjust our capacity, change our processing steps or ramp new technologies. In addition, we must continue to develop and implement new packaging and test technologies and expand our offering of packages to be competitive. Our production yields on new packages, particularly those packages which are based on new technologies, typically are significantly lower than our production yields on our more established packages.\nOur failure to qualify new processes, maintain quality standards or acceptable production yields, if significant and prolonged, could result in the loss of customers, increased costs of production, delays, substantial amounts of returned \ngoods and claims by customers relating thereto. Any of these problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive industry. A downturn or lower sales to customers in the automotive industry could materially affect our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales is to customers within the automotive industry. The automotive industry is cyclical, and, as a result, our customers in the automotive end-market are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, inflationary pressure, disruptive innovation and end-market preferences, which can adversely affect sales of our products and, correspondingly, our results of operations. The automotive industry is also subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which result in significant operational challenges, risk to our results of operations, and increased costs of our investments in serving customers in the automotive end-market. Additionally, the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in the automotive end-market could decline despite continued growth in such end-market. Lower sales to customers in the automotive end-market may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe loss of certain customers or reduced orders or pricing from existing customers may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe have derived and expect to continue to derive a large portion of our revenues from a small group of customers during any particular period due in part to the concentration of market share in the semiconductor industry. Our ten largest customers accounted for, in the aggregate, 72% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, we have significant customer concentration within our end markets. The loss of a significant customer, a business combination among our customers, a reduction in orders or decrease in price from a significant customer or disruption in any of our significant commercial arrangements may result in a decline in our sales and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nThe demand for our services from each customer is directly dependent upon that customer’s financial health, level of business activity and purchasing decisions, the quality and price of our services, our cycle time and delivery performance, the customer’s qualification of additional competitors on products we package or test and a number of other factors. Each of these factors could vary significantly from time to time resulting in the loss or reduction of customer orders, and we cannot be sure that our key customers or any other customers will continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as in past periods.\nFor example, as seen in the automotive end market in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions imposed by governmental authorities to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 decreased demand for our customers’ products and services, thereby adversely impacting their demand for our services. \nIn addition, from time to time, we may acquire or build new facilities or migrate existing business among our facilities. In connection with these facility changes or new facility constructions, our customers require us to qualify the new facilities even though we have already qualified to perform the services at our other facilities. We cannot assure that we will successfully qualify facility changes, that we will complete construction of new facilities in a timely manner or that our customers will not qualify our competitors and move the business for such services.\nWe may have difficulty funding liquidity needs.\nWe assess our liquidity based on our current expectations regarding sales and operating expenses, capital spending, dividend payments, stock repurchases, debt service requirements and other funding needs. We fund our operations, including capital expenditures and other investments and servicing principal and interest obligations with respect to our debt, from cash flows from our operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under available debt facilities, or proceeds from any additional debt or equity financing. Our liquidity is affected by, among other factors, volatility in the global economy and credit markets, the performance of our business, our capital expenditures and other investment levels, other uses of our cash, including any payments of dividends and purchases of stock under any stock repurchase program, any acquisitions or investments in joint ventures and any decisions we might make to either repay debt and \nother long-term obligations out of our operating cash flows or refinance debt at or prior to maturity with the proceeds of debt or equity financings.\nServicing our current and future customers requires that we incur significant operating expenses and continue to make significant capital expenditures and other investments, and the amount of our capital expenditures for 2025 and thereafter may vary materially and will depend on several factors. These factors include, among others, the amount, timing and implementation of our capital projects, the performance of our business, economic and market conditions, advances in technology, the cash needs and investment opportunities for the business, the need for additional capacity and facilities and the availability of cash flows from operations or financing. \nThe health of the worldwide banking system and capital markets also affects our liquidity. If financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by the conditions of the United States, foreign or international banking system and capital markets (including as a result of rising interest rates, economic downturns or other developments), they may refuse or be unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us. Volatility in the banking system and capital markets, as well as any further increase in interest rates or adverse economic, political, public health or other global conditions, could also make it difficult or more expensive for us to maintain our existing credit facilities or refinance our debt.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Such fluctuations could impact our decision or ability to utilize the equity markets as a potential source of our funding needs in the future.\nIn addition, there is a risk that we could fail to generate the necessary net income or operating cash flows to meet the funding needs of our business due to a variety of factors, including the other factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section. If we fail to generate the necessary cash flows or we are unable to access the capital markets when needed, our liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe face challenges as we integrate diverse operations. \nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, change in the scope and complexity of our operations resulting primarily from existing and future facility and operational consolidations, facility and operational expansions, strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and other partnering arrangements. Some of the risks from these activities include those associated with the following: \n•increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n•conforming an acquired company’s standards, practices, systems and controls with our operations;\n•increasing complexity from combining recent acquisitions of an acquired business; \n•unexpected losses of key employees or customers of an acquired business; \n•difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products; and \n•diversion of management and other resources from other parts of our operations and adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers. \nIn connection with these activities, we may:\n•incur costs associated with personnel reductions and voluntary retirement programs;\n•record restructuring charges to cover costs associated with facility consolidations and related cost reduction initiatives;\n•use a significant portion of our available cash; \n•incur substantial debt; \n•issue equity securities, which may dilute the ownership of current stockholders; \n•incur or assume known or unknown contingent liabilities; and \n•incur large, immediate accounting write offs and face antitrust or other regulatory inquiries or actions. \nFor example, the businesses we have acquired had, at the time of acquisition, multiple systems for managing their own production, sales, inventory and other operations. Migrating these businesses to our systems typically is a slow, expensive process requiring us to divert significant resources from other parts of our operations. We may continue to face these challenges in the future. As a result of the risks discussed above, the anticipated benefits of these or other future acquisitions, consolidations and partnering arrangements may not be fully realized, if at all, and these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our International Sales and Operations\nOur factories and operations, and those of our customers and vendors, are located in various foreign jurisdictions, which exposes us to risks arising from international trade restrictions and regional conflict.\nWe provide packaging and test services through our factories and other operations located in China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Portugal, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. Substantially all of our property, plant and equipment is located outside of the United States, and many of our customers and the vendors in our supply chain are also located outside the United States.  The following are some of the risks we face in doing business internationally:\n•restrictive trade barriers considered or adopted by U.S. and foreign governments applicable to the semiconductor supply chain, including laws, rules, regulations and policies in areas such as national security, licensing requirements for exports, tariffs, customs and duties, including the export rules and regulations applicable to U.S. companies that sell certain semiconductor and chipmaking equipment products to customers in China;\n•international trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, increasing protectionism and economic nationalism leading to increasing export restrictions, trade barriers, tariffs, and other changes in trade policy;\n•laws, rules, regulations and policies within China and other countries that may favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;\n•health and safety concerns, including widespread outbreak of infectious diseases and governmental responses thereto;\n•changes in consumer demand resulting from current or expected inflation or other variations in local economies;\n•laws, rules, regulations and policies imposed by U.S. or foreign governments in areas such as data privacy, cybersecurity, antitrust and competition, tax, currency and banking, labor, environmental, and health and safety;\n•the payment of dividends and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries may be subject to prohibitions, limitations or taxes in local jurisdictions;\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the U.S. dollar to Japanese yen exchange rate for our operations in Japan;\n•political and social conditions, and the potential for civil unrest, terrorism or other hostilities (such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel);\n•disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs brokers or government agencies;\n•difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel and managing foreign operations, including foreign labor disruptions;\n•difficulty in enforcing contractual rights and protecting our intellectual property rights;\n•potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from tax laws in the United States and in other jurisdictions; and\n•local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nMany of these factors and risks are present and may be heightened within our business operations in China. For example, changes in U.S.-China relations, the political environment or international trade policies could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations or retaliatory actions, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. Additionally, the BIS Regulations place limitations on the ability of companies to export certain advanced computing semiconductor chips, as well as chipmaking equipment, by requiring companies to obtain licenses to export such products and equipment into China or other designated countries. These expanded export restrictions limit our ability to sell to certain Chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies. Certain of the Company’s competitors may be exempt from the BIS Regulations by virtue of being non-U.S. manufacturers. To the extent required, Amkor would evaluate pursuing export licenses and authorizations, but there can be no assurances that Amkor would obtain such licenses or authorizations on a timely or cost-effective basis or at all, or that our customers will not reroute business that would have otherwise been given to Amkor to one or more of our competitors as a result of the BIS Regulations, particularly if our competitors have, or are not required to have, required licenses or authorizations that we have not obtained. It is also possible that government agencies in China or in other countries may adopt retaliatory export control rules in response to the BIS Regulations, which could further impact our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These restrictions have created, and these and similar restrictions may continue to create, uncertainty and caution with our current or prospective customers and may cause them to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers. Furthermore, if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view U.S. companies as unreliable, we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions, and our business could be materially harmed. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business, but these actions may have direct and indirect material adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in China and elsewhere. In addition, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust, cybersecurity, data protection and data privacy, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. \nWe also have significant facilities and other investments in Korea, and there have been heightened security concerns in recent years stemming from North Korea’s nuclear weapon and long-range missile programs as well as its military actions in the region. Furthermore, there has been a history of conflict and tension within and among other countries in the region.\nGlobal pandemics and the spread of infectious diseases may impact our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers as a result of illness, quarantines, facility closures and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with such outbreaks. National, regional, and local governments may implement public health measures to mitigate the spread of such outbreaks in jurisdictions in which we, our customers and our suppliers operate, and such restrictions may materially and adversely impact our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers. Such restrictions may also affect end-user demand in each geography where our customers sell their products and services, which may materially and adversely affect demand for our services, our operating results and our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Privacy and Intellectual Property\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to develop new proprietary technology, protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nThe complexity and scope of semiconductor packaging, SiP modules and test services are rapidly increasing. As a result, we expect to develop, acquire and implement new manufacturing processes and packaging technologies and tools in order to respond to competitive industry conditions and customer requirements. Technological advances may lead to rapid and significant price erosion and may make our existing packages less competitive or our existing inventories \nobsolete. If we cannot achieve advances in packaging design or obtain access to advanced packaging designs developed by others, our business could suffer.\nThe need to develop and maintain advanced packaging capabilities and equipment could require significant research and development, capital expenditures and acquisitions in future years. In addition, converting to new packaging designs or process methodologies could result in delays in producing new package types, which could impact our ability to meet customer orders and materially and adversely impact our business.\nAlthough we seek patent protection for some of our technology under U.S. and foreign patent laws, the process of seeking patent protection takes a long time and is expensive. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from pending or future applications or that, if patents are issued, the rights granted under the patents will provide us with meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. Any patents we do obtain may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented and will eventually expire. As a result, such patents may not offer us meaningful protection or provide the commercial advantage for which they were designed. \nSome of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application. The confidentiality agreements on which we rely to protect these technologies may be breached or may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technologies. There can be no assurance that other countries in which we market our services will protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States.\nOur competitors may develop, patent or gain access to know-how and technology similar or superior to our own. In addition, many of our patents are subject to cross licenses, several of which are with our competitors. The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding the infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights. If any third party makes an enforceable infringement claim against us or our customers, we could be required to:\n•discontinue the use of certain processes or cease to provide the services at issue, which could curtail our business;\n•pay substantial damages;\n•develop non-infringing technologies, which may not be feasible; or\n•acquire licenses to such technology, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may need to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights, including our rights under patent and intellectual property licenses with third parties, or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation, which could result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources and may not be successful. Furthermore, if we fail to obtain necessary licenses, our business could suffer, and we could be exposed to claims for damages and injunctions from third parties, as well as claims from our customers for indemnification. Unfavorable outcomes in any legal proceedings involving intellectual property could result in significant liabilities or loss of commercial advantage and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The potential impact from the legal proceedings referred to in this Form 10-K on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could change in the future.\nWe face risks in connection with the continuing development and implementation of changes to, and maintenance and security of, our information technology systems.\nWe depend on our information technology systems for many aspects of our business. Our systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading, replacing or maintaining software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, interruption or failures of third-party provider systems, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, ransomware attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, malfeasance or catastrophic events. Such events have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Cybersecurity breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and/or disruptions to our operations. While we have not experienced a material information security breach, we cannot be sure that such a breach will not occur in the future. The information technology systems in our factories are at varying levels of sophistication and maturity as the factories have different sets of products, processes and customer expectations. Some of our key software has been developed by our own programmers, and this software may not be easily integrated with other software and systems. \nFrom time to time, we make additions or changes to our information technology systems. For example, we continue to further integrate information technology systems in our facilities in Japan into our existing systems and processes. We face risks in connection with current and future projects to install or integrate new information technology systems or upgrade our existing systems. These risks include:\n•delays in the design and implementation of the system;\n•costs may exceed our plans and expectations; and\n•disruptions resulting from the implementation, integration or cybersecurity breach of the systems may impact our ability to process transactions and delay shipments to customers, impact our results of operations or financial condition or harm our control environment.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if our information technology systems are disrupted or if we are unable to successfully install new systems or improve, upgrade, integrate or expand upon our existing systems. We maintain insurance policies for various types of information security risks, including network security and privacy liability for third party claims, and business interruption and system failure reimbursement coverage, but we do not carry insurance for all the above referred risks. With regard to the insurance we do maintain, we cannot assure you that it would be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by a disruption, failure or breach of our information technology systems.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nCovenants in the indentures and agreements governing our current and future indebtedness could restrict our operating flexibility.\nThe indentures and agreements governing our existing debt contain, and debt we incur in the future may contain, affirmative and negative covenants that materially limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock, make certain investments and other payments, enter into certain mergers and consolidations, engage in sale leaseback transactions and encumber and dispose of assets. In addition, certain of our debt agreements contain, and our future debt agreements may contain, financial covenants and ratios.\nThe breach of any of these covenants by us, or the failure by us to meet any of the financial ratios or conditions, could result in a default under any or all of such indebtedness. If a default occurs under any such indebtedness, all of the outstanding obligations thereunder could become immediately due and payable, which could result in a default under our other outstanding debt and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to other outstanding debt. The existence of such a default or event of default could also preclude us from borrowing funds under our revolving credit facilities. Our ability to comply with the provisions of the indentures, credit facilities and other agreements governing our outstanding debt and indebtedness we may incur in the future can be affected by events beyond our control, and a default under any debt instrument, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, and the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness allow us and our subsidiaries to incur more debt, subject to certain limitations. As of December 31, 2024, our total debt balance was $1,159.5 million, of which $236.0 million was classified as a current liability and $639.5 million was collateralized indebtedness at our subsidiaries. We may consider investments in joint ventures, increased capital expenditures, refinancings or acquisitions which may increase our indebtedness. If new debt is added to our consolidated debt level, the related risks that we face could increase.\nOur substantial indebtedness could:\n•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including our obligations under our indentures to purchase notes tendered as a result of a change in control of Amkor;\n•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and other business opportunities, including joint ventures and acquisitions;\n•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments of interest and principal on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n•increase the volatility of the price of our common stock;\n•limit our flexibility to react to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n•place us at a competitive disadvantage to any of our competitors that have less debt;\n•limit, along with the financial and other covenants in our indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds;\n•limit our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness, particularly during periods of adverse credit market conditions when refinancing indebtedness may not be available under interest rates and other terms acceptable to us or at all; and\n•increase our cost of borrowing.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in credit risk, which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings as it relates to the market value of our investment portfolio. \nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility resulting from interest rate movements, changes in credit risk and financial market conditions. If such investments suffer market price declines, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be an impairment, including an allowance for credit loss. \nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nSusan Y. Kim and members of her family can effectively determine or substantially influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Susan Y. Kim, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and members of the Kim family and affiliates owned approximately 132.1 million shares, or approximately 54%, of our outstanding common stock. The Kim family also has options to acquire approximately 0.6 million shares. If the options are exercised, the Kim family’s total ownership would be an aggregate of approximately 132.7 million shares, or approximately 54% of our outstanding common stock.\nIn June 2013, the Kim family exchanged convertible notes issued by Amkor in 2009 for approximately 49.6 million shares of common stock (the “Convert Shares”). As of December 31, 2024, the Kim family owns 39.6 million Convert Shares. The Convert Shares owned by the Kim family are subject to a voting agreement. The voting agreement requires the Kim family to vote these shares in a “neutral manner” on all matters submitted to our stockholders for a vote, so that such Convert Shares are voted in the same proportion as all of the other outstanding securities (excluding the other shares owned by the Kim family) that are actually voted on a proposal submitted to Amkor’s stockholders for approval. The Kim family is not required to vote in a “neutral manner” any Convert Shares that, when aggregated with all other voting shares held by the Kim family, represent 41.6% or less of the total then-outstanding voting shares of our common stock. The voting agreement for the Convert Shares terminates upon the earliest of (i) such time as the Kim family no longer beneficially owns any of the Convert Shares, (ii) consummation of a change of control (as defined in the voting agreement) or (iii) the mutual agreement of the Kim family and Amkor.\nMs. Kim and her family and affiliates, acting together, have the ability to effectively determine or substantially influence matters submitted for approval by our stockholders including the election of our Board of Directors, by voting their shares or otherwise acting by written consent. There is also the potential, through the election of members of our Board of Directors, that the Kim family could substantially influence matters decided upon by our Board of Directors. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business consolidation involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares, and could also \nnegatively affect our stock’s market price or decrease any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay. Concentration of ownership also reduces the public float of our common stock. There may be less liquidity and higher price volatility for the stock of companies with a smaller public float compared to companies with broader public ownership. Also, the sale or the prospect of the sale of a substantial portion of the Kim family shares may cause the market price of our stock to decline significantly.\nWe may decrease or suspend our quarterly dividend, and any decrease in or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\nSince October 2020, we have declared a regular quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. However, the payment, amount and timing of future cash dividends are subject to the final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors or a committee thereof that there are sufficient funds available to lawfully pay a dividend, that the dividend is compliant with the applicable restrictions in our debt agreements and that the payment of the dividend remains in our and our stockholders’ best interests. The determination will be based on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, debt restrictions and other factors. Given these considerations, we may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to vary the timing of or suspend the payment of dividends in the future. Any decrease or suspension of dividend payments could cause our stock price to decline.\nRisks Related to Human Capital and Management\nWe face risks trying to attract, retain or replace qualified employees to support our operations.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior management, sales and technical personnel, any of whom may be difficult to replace. Competition for qualified employees is intensifying, accelerated by increasing competition in the semiconductor industry for talent to meet strong demand, and our business could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of the services of any of our existing key personnel, including senior management and technical talent, as a result of competition or for any other reason. Labor shortages could also result in higher wages that would increase our labor costs, which could reduce our profits. Although we have entered into agreements with our Chief Executive Officer and certain other executives that would prevent them from working for, or impose financial penalties for doing business with, our competitors in the event that those executives cease working for us, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to retain or replace key employees or in hiring and properly training sufficient numbers of qualified personnel and in effectively managing our growth. Our inability to attract, retain, motivate and train qualified new personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal and Tax Challenges\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of their inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud or corruption. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections concerning the effectiveness of internal controls in future periods are subject to the risk that our internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nWe assess our internal controls and systems on an ongoing basis, and from time-to-time, we update and make modifications to our global enterprise resource planning system. We have implemented several significant enterprise resource planning and shop floor management systems and expect to implement additional similar systems in the future. There is a risk that deficiencies may occur that could constitute significant deficiencies or, in the aggregate, a material weakness.\nIf we fail to remedy any deficiencies or maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our operating results or financial condition. \nWe could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if there are changes in tax laws or taxing authorities do not agree with our interpretation of applicable tax laws, including whether we continue to qualify for conditional reduced tax rates, or if we are required to establish or adjust valuation allowances on deferred tax assets.\nWe earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries, and our operations are subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions with complicated and varied tax regimes. Tax laws and income tax rates in these jurisdictions are subject to change due to economic and political conditions. Changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing and has developed model rules including establishing a global minimum corporate income tax tested on a jurisdictional basis (the “Pillar Two Model Rules”). Some countries we operate in have enacted laws based on the Pillar Two Model Rules effective in 2024. While the Pillar Two Model Rules did not have a material impact on our 2024 results, additional countries where we operate, including Singapore, have adopted Pillar Two Model Rules effective in 2025. Enactment of this legislation is expected to adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and conditional reduced tax rates. Changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, including new or modified guidance with respect to existing tax laws, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \nOur tax liabilities are based, in part, on our corporate structure, interpretations of various U.S. and foreign tax laws, including withholding tax, compliance with conditional reduced tax rate requirements, application of changes in tax law to our operations and other relevant laws of applicable taxing jurisdictions. From time to time, taxing authorities may conduct examinations of our income tax returns and other regulatory filings. We cannot assure you that the taxing authorities will agree with our interpretations, including whether we continue to qualify for conditional reduced tax rates. If they do not agree, we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities. We may also appeal a taxing authority’s determination to the appropriate governmental authorities, but we cannot be sure we will prevail. If we do not prevail or if we enter into settlements with taxing authorities, we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges (or reduce tax assets) that materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries operate under conditional reduced tax rates, which will expire in whole or in part at various dates in the future. As those conditional reduced tax rates expire, we expect that our tax expense will increase as income from those jurisdictions becomes subject to higher statutory income tax rates, thereby reducing our liquidity and cash flow. \nWe monitor on an ongoing basis our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and whether there is a need for a related valuation allowance. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets in the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and recent results of operations. In the event taxable income falls short of current expectations, we may need to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets that, if required, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nEnvironmental, health and safety liabilities and expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations in places we do business impose various controls on the use, storage, handling, discharge and disposal of chemicals used or generated in, or emitted by, our production processes, on the factories we occupy and on the materials contained in semiconductor products. For example, at our foreign facilities we produce liquid waste when semiconductor wafers are diced into chips with the aid of diamond saws, then cooled with running water. In addition, semiconductor packages have historically utilized metallic alloys containing lead within the interconnect terminals typically referred to as leads, pins or balls. The European Union’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive and similar laws in other jurisdictions, including China, impose strict restrictions on the placement into the market of electrical and electronic equipment containing lead and certain other hazardous substances. We may become liable under these and other environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including for the cost of compliance and cleanup of any disposal or release of hazardous materials arising out of our former or current operations, or otherwise as a result of the emission of GHGs or other chemicals, the existence of hazardous materials on our properties or the existence of hazardous substances in the products for which we perform our services. We could also be held liable for damages, including fines, penalties and the cost of investigations and remedial actions, and we could be subject to revocation of permits, which may materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand our operations. Additionally, if Amkor is unable to align its environmental, health and \nsafety practices with shifting customer preferences, we could suffer reputational harm, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nThere has also been an increase in regulatory and public attention and industry and customer focus on the materials contained in semiconductor products, the environmental impact of semiconductor operations and the risk of chemical releases from such operations, climate change, sustainability and related environmental concerns. Increased regulation of and restriction on the use of hazardous substances may impact our supply chain due to decreased availability, necessitate changes in our packaging processes, require us to seek substitutes that may not be readily available in the marketplace or eliminate the use of such hazardous substances although there may not be a technically feasible alternative. This increased focus on sustainability and the environmental impact of semiconductor operations and products has caused industry groups and customers to impose additional requirements on us and our suppliers, sometimes exceeding regulatory standards. These industry and customer requirements include increased tracking and reporting of GHG emissions, reductions in waste and wastewater from operations, additional reporting on the materials and components used in the products for which we perform our services, and the use of renewable energy sources in our factory operations. In addition, recent and ongoing changes to climate change regulation could increase our compliance costs, including as a result of carbon pricing impacts on electrical utilities as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. We have started to incur compliance costs within our existing manufacturing infrastructure, and such costs may increase as we expand our manufacturing capacity. To comply with these additional requirements, we may need to procure additional, or increase the use of, renewable energy, procure additional equipment or make factory or process changes, which could result in increased operating costs.\nThe awards and incentives from the agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) pursuant to the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (“CHIPS Act”) might not materialize as such awards and incentives are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain outcomes and compliance with other obligations, are subject to reduction, termination, or clawback and would impose certain restrictions on our business.\nIn December 2024, Commerce awarded us up to $407 million in direct funding pursuant to the CHIPS Act for the Arizona Facility. This award requires us to achieve construction and production milestones and restricts us from undertaking certain activities. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve and maintain outcomes or be able to comply with other obligations required to qualify for this award or that Commerce will provide or continue to provide such funding. The award arrangements provide Commerce with rights to audit our compliance with their terms and obligations, and such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the award. To a lesser extent, we also receive incentives from state and local governments for the Arizona Facility, which have similar terms and conditions. Any awards or incentives we receive could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and any decrease, termination, or clawback of such government awards and incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business and financial condition has been adversely affected, and could be adversely affected in the future, by natural disasters and other calamities, health conditions or pandemics, political instability, hostilities or other disruptions.\nWe have significant packaging and test services and other operations in China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Portugal, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam. Such operations are or could be subject to: natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, floods, droughts, volcanoes and other severe weather and geological events, and other calamities, such as fire; the outbreak of infectious diseases (such as Covid-19 and other coronaviruses, Ebola or flu); industrial strikes; government-imposed travel restrictions or quarantines; breakdowns of equipment; difficulties or delays in obtaining materials, equipment, utilities and services; political events or instability; acts of war or armed conflict (such as ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel); terrorist incidents and other hostilities in regions where we have facilities; and industrial accidents and other events, that could disrupt or even shut down our operations. While our global manufacturing footprint allows us to shift production to other factories without substantial cost or production delays, certain of our services are currently performed using equipment located in one or only a subset of our factories. A major disruption or shutdown of any such factory could completely impair our ability to perform those services or require us to \nshift them to another location. As a result, our ability to fulfill customer orders may be impaired or delayed, and we could incur significant losses.\nFor example, in April 2016, our Kumamoto factory was damaged by earthquakes in Japan. As a result of these earthquakes, our sales were reduced due to the temporary disruption in operations, and we incurred earthquake-related costs for damaged inventory, buildings and equipment. Our suppliers and customers also have significant operations in such locations, and this could compound the effect of any such disruption. In the event of such a disruption or shutdown, we may be unable to reallocate production to other facilities in a timely or cost-effective manner (if at all), and we may not have sufficient capacity, or customer approval, to service customer demands in our other facilities. A natural disaster or other calamity, political instability, the occurrence of hostilities or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, some of the processes that we utilize in our operations place us at risk of fire and other damage. For example, highly flammable gases are used in the preparation of wafers holding semiconductor devices for flip chip packaging.\nWe maintain insurance policies for various types of property, casualty and other risks, but we do not carry insurance for all the above referred risks. With regard to the insurance we do maintain, we cannot assure you that it would be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters and other calamities.",
