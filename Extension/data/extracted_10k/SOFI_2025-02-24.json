Business\nCompany Overview![alt  SoFi segments and products.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000181887425000016/sofi-20241231_g2.jpg)\nWe are a mission driven company designed to help our members achieve financial independence in order to realize their ambitions. To us, financial independence does not mean being wealthy, but rather represents the ability of our members to have the financial means to achieve their personal objectives at each stage of life, such as owning a home, having a family, or having a career of their choice — more simply stated, to have enough money to do what they want. We were founded in 2011 and have developed a suite of financial products that offers the speed, selection, content and convenience that only an integrated digital platform can provide. In order for us to achieve our mission, we have to help people get their money right, which means providing them with the ability to borrow better, save better, spend better, invest better and protect better. Everything we do today is geared toward helping our members “Get Your Money Right” and we strive to innovate and build ways for our members to achieve this goal. \nIn order to help achieve our mission, we are a member-centric, one-stop shop for financial services that, through our Lending and Financial Services products, allows members to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their money. We refer to our customers as “members” and “clients”. We offer personal loans, student loans, home loans and related servicing and offer a variety of financial services products, such as SoFi Money, SoFi Credit Card, SoFi Invest and SoFi Relay, that provide more daily interactions with our members, as well as products and capabilities, such as SoFi At Work, that are designed to appeal to enterprises. Lending related services that we offer through our Loan Platform Business help a broader range of borrowers to find lending solutions, through our relationships with members as well as third-party enterprise partners. We have also made strategic acquisitions to further expand our technology platform capabilities for enterprises, which we believe deepen our participation in the entire technology ecosystem powering digital financial services. \nWe have built a personalized area within our digital native application, which we refer to as the member home experience. The member home experience is personalized and delivers content to a member about what they must do that day in their financial life, what they should consider doing that day in their financial life, and what they can do that day in their financial life. Through the member home experience, there are significant opportunities to build frequent engagement and, to date, the member home experience has been an important driver of new product adoption. The member home experience is an important part of our strategy and our ability to use data as a competitive advantage. \nTo complement these products and services, we believe in establishing partnerships with other enterprises to leverage our existing capabilities to reach a broader market and in building vertically-integrated technology platforms designed to manage and deliver our suite of products and technology solutions to our members and clients in a low-cost and differentiated manner. \nOur three reportable segments and their primary product and service offerings as of December 31, 2024 were as follows: \n_________________\n(1)Loan Platform Business, formerly referred to as lending as a service, includes activity related to (i) certain loans which we originate on behalf of third-party partners, (ii) referred loans which are originated by a third-party partner to which we provide pre-qualified borrower referrals, (iii) certain loans \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nassociated with our Lantern financial services marketplace platform, and (iv) servicing rights assumed from third parties. Refer to “Our Reportable Segments—Financial Services Segment” and “Our Reportable Segments—Lending Segment” for more information.\nMembers\nWe have created an innovative financial services platform designed to offer best-in-class products to meet the broad objectives of our members and the lifecycle of their financial needs. Our platform offers our members (as defined under Part II, Item 7. “Key Business Metrics”) a suite of financial products and services, enabling them to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect their finances across one integrated platform, as well as personal financial management tools and benefits to complement our products. Our aim is to create a best-in-class, integrated financial services platform that will generate a virtuous cycle whereby positive member experiences will lead to new product adoption by existing members and enhanced profitability for each additional product by lowering overall member acquisition costs and increasing the lifetime value of our members. We refer to this virtuous cycle as our “Financial Services Productivity Loop”, which is further discussed below.\nEnterprises\nIn addition to benefiting our members, our products and capabilities are also designed to appeal to enterprises, such as financial services institutions that subscribe to our enterprise services and third-party partners in our Loan Platform Business, and have become interconnected with the SoFi platform. We have continued to expand our platform capabilities for enterprises through strategic acquisitions, including: (i) our acquisition of Galileo in 2020, which provides technology platform services to financial and non-financial institutions and which has allowed us to vertically integrate across more of our financial services, and (ii) the Technisys Merger in the first quarter of 2022, through which we added a cloud-native digital and core banking platform into our technology platform offerings and expanded our technology platform services to a broader international market. These expansions have deepened our participation in the entire technology ecosystem powering digital financial services, allowing us to not only reduce costs to operate our member-centric business, but also deliver increasing value to our enterprise customers. While our enterprises are not considered members, they are important contributors to the growth of the SoFi platform, and also have their own constituents who might benefit from our products in the future.\nSoFi Bank\nIn February 2022, we closed the Bank Merger, pursuant to which we became a bank holding company and began operating as SoFi Bank. Golden Pacific’s community bank business continues to operate as a division of SoFi Bank.\nAs a bank holding company, we offer checking and savings accounts and credit cards through SoFi Bank. We are originating all new loans within SoFi Bank, and we intend to continue to explore other products for SoFi Bank over time. The key current and expected financial benefits to us of operating a national bank include: (i) lowering our cost to fund loans, as we can utilize deposits held at SoFi Bank to fund loans, which generally have a lower borrowing cost of funds than warehouse and securitization financing, (ii) increasing our flexibility to hold loans on our balance sheet for longer periods, thereby enabling us to earn interest on these loans for a longer period, (iii) supporting origination volume growth by providing an alternative financing option, while also maintaining our warehouse capacity, and (iv) through deposits, providing us with meaningful member data that can allow us to better serve our members’ financial needs. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain potential risks related to being a bank holding company.\nInternational Operations\nWhile we primarily operate in the United States, we also operate internationally in Latin America and Canada, largely through our Technology Platform segment, as well as in Hong Kong through SoFi Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited (an investment business).\nOur DifferentiationIn order to build best-in-class offerings, we focus on four differentiators: fast, selection, content and convenience. \n(1)Fast — We aspire to be the fastest place for our members to responsibly do anything, whether it’s applying for a loan, getting a funded loan, opening an account, buying or selling a stock, uploading a mobile check, getting access to money, paying a friend, or accessing relevant financial content. Other than certain products acquired and offered through SoFi Bank, our products are all digital and we have a culture of iteration to help drive faster and faster services. \n(2)Selection — Given the digital nature of our products, the permutations of features and services that can be made available to our members across their needs to borrow, save, spend, invest and protect are significant. We will continue \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nto iterate, learn and innovate to broaden our selection in the same way we did this year by providing our members with competitive interest rates on checking and savings accounts, options trading, “Pay in 4” (a buy now, pay later product), and SoFi Plus membership benefits. \n(3)Content — Our financial education, insights, research content, actionable tools and advice are designed to provide meaningful value for our members. Our carefully-crafted and personalized content is offered through our member home experience and is designed to help our members get their money right. We strive to provide digestible financial education, meaningful answers, salient information, advice, credit scores, financial calculators, investment research and financial news that enhance member loyalty and increase the likelihood that members will use additional SoFi products. \n(4)Convenience — We hold ourselves accountable and aim to provide the most convenient member experience possible in terms of ease of use, ubiquity, functionality, simplicity and responsive customer service. Our long-term goal is to provide the most convenient 24x7 service and dispel the historical construct of financial service availability based on 9-5 Monday through Friday. \nEach product we offer is delivered in a member-centric way and is built and enhanced with these differentiators in mind. We believe that our member-centric, one-stop shop for financial services serves as a competitive differentiator for us relative to other financial services providers.\nWe offer our members a full suite of financial products and services all in one common mobile application. To complement these products and services, we believe in building vertically-integrated technology platforms designed to manage and deliver the suite of solutions to our members in a low-cost and differentiated manner. \nThe Financial Services Productivity Loop![alt  FSPL.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000181887425000016/sofi-20241231_g3.jpg)\nWe believe that developing a comprehensive, long-term relationship with our members and gaining their trust is central to our success as a financial services platform. We have a digital-first financial services platform that we believe can support all of our members’ financial services needs throughout their lifetime. We believe this will lead to a competitive advantage over other financial institutions that provide a disjointed and non-seamless product experience, a lack of digital customer acquisition, subpar mobile web products instead of digital native apps and incomplete product offerings to meet a customer’s holistic financial needs. \nA central part of our strategy is rooted in what we refer to as our “Financial Services Productivity Loop”, which is focused on building a durable relationship with our members, which we believe will help build a sustainable competitive advantage. \nIn order to deliver on our strategy, we must develop a comprehensive set of best-in-class products that build trust and reliability with our members and our platform. Members often come to us for a specific need, then later consider using \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nadditional products from our offering. Doing more business with existing members results in increased revenue per member and lower acquisition cost, resulting in higher lifetime value per member. This also reinforces the benefits of our platform, which simplifies the entire financial ecosystem for our members, helping them get their money right. We are able to use the increased revenue to further improve member benefits, such as those we provide through our SoFi Plus offering, and product experience. \nIn addition to realizing the benefits of more of our members adopting multiple SoFi products, the Financial Services Productivity Loop strategy delivers operating and technology efficiencies to deliver improved unit economics. \nOur Reportable SegmentsWe conduct our business through three reportable segments: Lending, Technology Platform and Financial Services. Below is a discussion of our segments and their primary products and non-product offerings.\nLending Segment \nWe offer personal loans, student loans, home loans and related servicing to help our members with a variety of financial needs. We believe that our market opportunity within each of these lending channels is significant. Our lending process primarily leverages an in-application, digital borrowing experience, which we believe serves as a competitive advantage as digital lending becomes increasingly ubiquitous. Furthermore, our platform supports the full transaction lifecycle, including credit application, underwriting, approval, funding and servicing. Through data derived at loan origination and throughout the servicing process, SoFi has life-of-loan performance data on each loan in our ecosystem that we originate and on which we retain servicing, which provides a meaningful data asset. Net interest income, which we define as the difference between the earned interest income and interest expense to finance loans, is a key component of the profitability of our Lending segment, along with fee income.\nPersonal Loans.   We originate personal loans to help our members with a variety of financial needs, such as debt consolidation, home improvement projects, family planning, travel and weddings, to name a few. We offer fixed rate loans with flexible repayment terms. We generally offer loan sizes of $5,000 to $100,000, subject to legal and/or licensing requirements, with terms generally ranging from 2 to 7 years. We regularly update the annual percentage rates offered on our personal loans.\nStudent Loans.   We operate in the student loan refinance space, with a focus on prime and super-prime school loans, as well as the “in-school” lending space, which allows members to borrow funds while they attend school. We offer flexible loan sizes, repayment options and competitive rates. Within student loan refinancing, we generally offer loan sizes of $5,000 or higher, subject to legal and/or licensing requirements, with terms generally ranging from 5 to 20 years. Within in-school loans, we generally offer loan sizes of $1,000 or higher, subject to legal and/or licensing requirements, with terms generally ranging from 5 to 15 years. We regularly update the annual percentage rates offered on our fixed and variable-rate student loans.\nHome Loans.   We offer agency, non-agency and certain government loans (e.g., VA and FHA loans) for members purchasing a home or refinancing an existing mortgage. For our home loan products, we offer competitive rates, flexible down payment options for as little as 3% (or 0% for VA loans), a close on time guarantee, and educational tools and calculators. For one-unit properties, we generally offer loan sizes of $75,000 to $806,500 in conforming normal cost areas (with exceptions for smaller loan sizes considered on a case-by-case basis), up to $1,209,750 in conforming high cost areas (GSE-eligible loans above the normal conforming limit, which is determined by county). For multi-unit properties, we offer loan sizes up to $2,326,875. In addition, we offer loan sizes up to $3,000,000 for jumbo loans (loans in the jumbo loan program), up to $1,500,000 for VA loans, and up to $524,225 for Federal Housing Administration loans in most areas. Our fixed rate home loans generally have terms of 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 years. We offer adjustable rate mortgage products for conforming and jumbo loans, with a fixed rate for 5, 7 or 10 years followed by rate adjustments every six months for the remainder of the 30-year term, and for VA and FHA loans, with a fixed rate for 5 years followed by rate adjustments every year for the remainder of the 30-year term. We regularly update the annual percentage rates offered on our home loans. During 2024, we began offering fixed rate home equity loans and variable rate HELOCs.\nLending Model\nWe originate loans through our lending business, and have the option of pursuing a gain-on-sale origination model, whereby we seek to recognize a gain from these loans and sell them into either our whole loan or securitization channels, or holding loans on our balance sheet when advantageous. This enables us to maximize our return and balance our risk by earning interest on these loans for a longer period and to be selective in our sales arrangements. We sell our whole loans primarily to large financial institutions. In securitization transactions that do not qualify for sale accounting, the related assets remain on our balance sheet and cash proceeds received are reported as liabilities, with related interest expense recognized over the life of the \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nrelated borrowing. In securitization transactions that qualify for sale accounting, we typically have insignificant continuing involvement as an investor. In the case of both whole loan sales and securitizations, and with the exception of certain of our home loans, we also continue to retain servicing rights to our originated loans following transfer. \nWe also originate and sell loans in support of our Loan Platform Business, through which we provide lending related services to third-party partners. We maintain the same lending relationship with borrowers across all loans that we originate, inclusive of those originated on behalf of a third-party partner and as such, reflect these products within our Lending segment total products. This enables borrowers to gain access to all the benefits of becoming a SoFi member, and enhances our opportunities to sell additional products from across our platform to these members. See “Financial Services Segment” for more information.\nWe directly service all of the personal loans that we originate through our lending business, as well as provide servicing in support of our Loan Platform Business on loans originated on behalf of third-party partners and servicing rights assumed from third parties. We act as master servicer for, and rely on sub-servicers to directly service, all of our student loans and GSE conforming home loans. We view servicing as an integral component of the Lending segment, as we believe our servicing function is an important asset because of the connection to the member it affords us throughout the life of the loan thereby enhancing the effectiveness of our Financial Services Productivity Loop by increasing member touchpoints and driving new product adoption by existing members.\nWe rely upon deposits, warehouse financing and our own capital to enable us to continue to expand our origination capabilities. Our ability to utilize deposits held at SoFi Bank to fund our loans has lowered our overall cost of asset-backed financing relative to alternative sources of funding. We expect to benefit from the continued mix towards deposit funding through operating SoFi Bank.\nUnderwriting Process\nWe have developed an extensive underwriting process across each lending product that is focused on willingness to pay (measured by credit attributes and risk scores), ability to pay (measured through free cash flow), and stability (measured by credit experience). A key element of our underwriting process is the ability to facilitate risk-based interest rates that we believe are appropriate for each loan using proprietary risk models. We believe the outcome of this process helps us determine a more data-driven, risk-adjusted interest rate that we can offer our members. Further, our data and monitoring tools enable us to implement risk mitigation strategies quickly and efficiently, including underwriting standard adjustments to adapt our operations to changing environments and expectations. \nOur personal loan and student loan underwriting models are typically based on credit reports, standard industry credit scores, custom credit assessment models, and debt capacity analysis, as indicated by borrower free cash flow. Our underwriting strategy utilizes an advanced risk model that provides refined risk separation. Home loans originated by SoFi that are agency-conforming loans are subject to credit, debt-to-income, and collateral eligibility established by the GSEs. Government loans, such as VA and Federal Housing Administration loans, are subject to the underwriting requirements established by the appropriate government agency. In addition to these requirements, agency-conforming and government loans are subject to credit eligibility overlays imposed by SoFi as well as individual investor requirements. Other non-agency loans originated by us, such as jumbo loans, are subject to investor credit criteria, which typically includes a minimum tri-bureau credit score, established credit history requirements, income verification, as well as maximum limits on debt-to-income and caps on loan-to-value. \nWe also leverage our data to provide existing members a streamlined application process through automation. Across our loan products, existing members generally experience a higher approval rate than new members, subject to the existing member being in good standing on their existing products.\nTechnology Platform Segment \nWe provide technology platform services through a diversified suite of offerings which include an event and authorization platform accessed via application programming interfaces, a cloud-native digital and core banking platform and services related to both platforms. Our customers include financial institutions, government entities and non-financial institutions in primarily North America and Latin America. We earn technology product and solutions revenue through the use of the platforms, either as a stand ready obligation, or from overall license and maintenance fee service arrangements related to those respective platforms. We also offer additional add-on technology solutions to support our clients and drive engagement, such as a conversational AI engine for customers of banks and financial institutions, and a real-time payment risk platform which employs AI and machine learning technology to enhance payment fraud mitigation strategies for financial customers. We \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\ncontinue to leverage investments made to integrate Galileo and Technisys and position the Technology Platform segment for diversified durable growth.\nFinancial Services Segment \nWe offer a suite of financial services solutions, the most significant of which are discussed below. Our financial services products (as defined under Part II, Item 7. “Key Business Metrics”) by nature provide more daily interactions with our members and are differentiated from our lending products, which inherently provide less consistent touchpoints with our members. We also offer financial services solutions which are designed to appeal to enterprises, including our At Work product and lending related services offered through our Loan Platform Business. Certain products, such as our complementary SoFi Relay product, do not provide direct sources of revenue but foster additional touch points with our members. We believe that our suite of financial services offerings provide many ways for our members to actively engage in getting their money right as well as attractive enterprise solutions. This enables us to deliver positive experiences through various channels, building trust and durable relationships which can ultimately demonstrate the effectiveness of our Financial Services Productivity Loop virtuous cycle.\nSoFi Money\nChecking and savings accounts provide a digital banking experience which allows members to spend, save and earn interest and rewards in flexible ways. We believe SoFi Checking and Savings accounts held at SoFi Bank are attractive to our members and prospective members due to our differentiated offerings, including competitive interest rates, access to expanded FDIC insurance coverage of up to $2 million through our Insured Deposit Program and the convenience and benefits of being part of a cohesive, simplified financial ecosystem within our mobile platform.\nOur legacy cash management product utilizes a sweep administrator to sweep funds to and from program banks (inclusive of SoFi Bank), as necessary, under a program broker agreement between SoFi Securities and the sweep administrator, as well as program account and program bank agreements. Following the Bank Merger, we began to allow members to convert their cash management accounts into checking and savings accounts held at SoFi Bank. Effective June 5, 2022, most of our SoFi Money cash management accounts no longer earn interest, as we implemented our plan to build new features only for SoFi Checking and Savings and reduce support of our SoFi Money cash management accounts.\nSoFi Invest\nA mobile-first investment platform offering members access to trading and advisory solutions, such as active investing and robo-advisory. Our interactive investing experience fosters engagement by allowing members to view and monitor other investors’ activity on the platform. Our active investing service enables members to buy and sell stocks and ETFs, as well as alternative investment funds, mutual funds and money market funds beginning in January 2024, to engage in options trading, to participate in IPOs, to buy and sell fractional shares, to engage in margin investing and to access a retirement investment account. Our robo-advisory service offers a variety of managed portfolios comprising ETFs and mutual funds that are built and managed by our investment committee with support from an asset management partner. Additionally, we provide introductory brokerage services to our members and have invested heavily to create an appealing mobile investing experience.\nIn connection with our approval as a bank holding company in February 2022, the Federal Reserve determined that the activities of SoFi Digital Assets, LLC in providing members with the ability to buy or sell various digital currencies through SoFi Digital Assets, LLC's omnibus account with a third-party custodian is not a permissible activity under the Bank Holding Company Act and Regulation Y. However, under Section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve permitted us to continue our current digital assets related offering for a two-year conformance period from the date we became a bank holding company, with the possibility for three one-year extensions, provided that we do not expand our impermissible activities, except as authorized by the Bank Holding Company Act and Regulation Y, or increase our established risk limits for total customer digital assets maintained in wallets that are accessible online, referred to as “hot wallets”, or held on balance sheet. Based on this, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we made the decision to transfer the crypto services provided within SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, and began closing existing digital assets accounts. This process was completed in the first quarter of 2024. See Note 1. Organization, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and New Accounting Standards to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the transfer of the crypto services.\nLoan Platform Business: We provide lending related services to a broader set of members through our platform of enterprise partners. Revenue from the Loan Platform Business is fee-based. This includes (i) activity through which third-party partners leverage our end-to-end origination and servicing platform to acquire loans within their credit specifications on a fee per loan basis, (ii) referred loans originated by a third-party partner to which we provide pre-qualified borrower referrals, and \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n(iii) activity related to certain loans associated with our Lantern financial services marketplace platform. In addition, we offer loan servicing support through our lending business. See “Lending Segment ” for more information.\nAdditional financial services solutions offered within our platform include:\n•SoFi Credit Card: Designed to help eligible members spend better with cash back rewards on every purchase and without limits. We offer three different credit card products, all of which feature no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees and cash back rewards on trips booked through SoFi Travel. The SoFi Essential credit card offers a reliable credit line for those focused on building or improving their credit scores. Our SoFi Unlimited and Everyday Cash Rewards cash back credit cards also feature flexible options to redeem cash back rewards through statement credit or other SoFi products, with a 10% boost on cash back rewards earned for credit card members with direct deposit through SoFi Checking and Savings.\n•SoFi Relay: A personal finance management product that allows members to track all of their financial accounts in one place and gain meaningful insights into their financial health and habits to help them improve their financial standing, such as credit score monitoring and spending behaviors. SoFi Relay also provides us with unified intelligence about our members that offers information about what SoFi products and features may help our members best achieve their financial goals, allowing us to further personalize the SoFi experience for our members.\n•Lantern: A financial services marketplace platform developed to help small businesses and individuals who do not qualify for SoFi products, through a simplified search and application experience that connects these users to alternative financial solutions from a curated network of other providers.\n•SoFi Protect: A service through which we partner with providers who offer insurance products to help our members protect their assets, including providers across auto, life, homeowners, renters, and cyber insurance products and estate planning.\n•SoFi Travel: A service through which we partner with a provider to offer an easy travel search and booking experience that can be managed directly through the SoFi app or website, alongside expanded member benefits including member prices on certain bookings and additional cash back rewards on purchases made with SoFi Credit Card.\n•SoFi At Work: A service through which we partner with other enterprises looking for a seamless way to provide financial benefits to their employees, such as student loan payments made on their employees’ behalf.\nWe believe that the content and features we provide within our mobile application can spur more financial education, which leads to more ways for our members to actively engage in getting their money right and utilize SoFi products.\nCompetitionWe compete at multiple levels, including: (i) competition among other personal loan, student loan, credit card and residential lenders, (ii) competition for deposits among other banks, some challenger banks and a variety of technology and retail companies, (iii) competition with social media and other commerce platforms and applications that offer peer-to-peer, in-app and social commerce payment capabilities, (iv) competition for investment accounts among other introductory brokerage firms and a variety of technology and other companies, (v) competition for subscribers to financial services content, and (vi) competition among other technology platforms for the enterprise services we provide, such as platform as a service and cloud-native digital and core banking services. \nCompetition to fund prime loans. The prime lending market is highly fragmented and competitive. We face competition from a diverse landscape of consumer lenders, including other banks, credit unions and specialty finance lenders, as well as alternative technology-enabled lenders. \nCompetition to acquire deposits. Although we now operate a bank, many other banks are larger, have been in business longer and often have greater brand awareness than us. Some large technology and retail companies have large consumer bases and strong balance sheets, which could enhance their competitive ability.\nCompetition to acquire investment brokerage accounts. We face competition from brokerage platforms that provide some of the same features as us, such as a mobile brokerage experience, robo-investing, fractional share investing and options trading. In addition, the leading incumbent brokerage firms are larger, have been in business longer and generally have greater brand awareness than us. Technology and other companies have begun to offer some basic investing features and the ability to buy and sell digital and other assets. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCompetition to attract financial services content viewership. There are many sources of financial news in the marketplace, many of which are more established and have a larger subscriber base. \nCompetition for technology products and solutions. Generally, these arrangements are multi-year contracts, which require us to spend the necessary resources on implementation and interconnecting new clients onto our platform. We face competition from larger institutions that could make investments into an integrated platform as a service solution or to a cloud-native digital and core banking solution, and also undercut our pricing, preventing our current clients from renewing, while also impeding our attempts to acquire new clients. \nMarketingOur sales and marketing efforts are designed to drive brand awareness, improve member acquisition efficiency and accelerate our Financial Services Productivity Loop. We attract and retain members through multiple marketing channels, including social media, press, online affiliations, search engine optimization, search engine marketing, offline partnerships and sponsorship arrangements, preapproved direct mailings and television advertising. We continue to optimize our marketing strategy through a focus on our full suite of financial products and iterate on opportunities to accelerate the Financial Services Productivity Loop. \nGovernment Supervision and RegulationWe are subject to extensive and complex supervision and examination by various federal, state and local government authorities designed to, among other things, protect depositors, borrowers and other customers. The following is a summary of certain aspects of the various statutes and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries. This summary is not a comprehensive analysis of all applicable laws, and is qualified by reference to the full text of statutes and regulations referenced below, which may be modified or amended from time to time. In addition, significant political, policy or regulatory developments stemming from the change in U.S. presidential administration may impact the agencies that regulate us and result in substantial changes to the laws outlined below. Such changes are difficult to predict and may have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA, and SoFi Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC and secondary supervisory authority by the FDIC as the insurer of SoFi Bank’s deposits, and beginning January 1, 2024, SoFi Bank and its affiliates became subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB. SoFi Securities is subject to regulation by FINRA and the SEC and the Company and its affiliates are subject to supervision and examination by various state regulators.\nBank Holding Company Regulation.   The Federal Reserve has the authority, among other things, to order bank holding companies such as the Company to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices, to assess civil money penalties and to order termination of non-banking activities or termination of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company. \nSource of Strength.   Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to serve as a source of financial strength for SoFi Bank. This means that we may be required to provide capital or liquidity support to SoFi Bank, even at times when we may not have the resources to provide such support to SoFi Bank. \nAcquisitions and Activities.   The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve, from acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, acquiring control of a bank, merging or consolidating with another bank holding company, or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would control more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such other bank or bank holding company. The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks. However, a bank holding company may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve has determined, by order or regulation, to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. \nThe Company has elected to be treated as a financial holding company pursuant to Section 4(l) of the BHCA. As a financial holding company, the Company is authorized to engage in a broader set of financial activities than a bank holding company that has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company, including insurance underwriting and broker-dealer services as well as activities that are jointly determined by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury to be financial in nature or \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nincidental to such financial activity. Financial holding companies may also engage in activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve to be complementary to financial activities. “Financial activities” is broadly defined to include not only banking, insurance and securities activities, but also merchant banking and additional activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, determines to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activities, or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally.\nIf a financial holding company or any depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to remain well capitalized and well managed, the Federal Reserve may impose such limitations on the conduct or activities of the financial holding company as the Federal Reserve determines to be appropriate, and the company and its affiliates may not commence any new activity or acquire control of shares of any company engaged in any activity that is authorized particularly for financial holding companies without first obtaining the approval of the Federal Reserve. The Company must also comply with all applicable Federal Reserve requirements for financial holding companies. If a financial holding company remains out of compliance for 180 days or such longer period as the Federal Reserve permits, the Federal Reserve may require the financial holding company to divest either its insured depository institution or all of its non-banking subsidiaries engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company. If an insured depository institution subsidiary of a financial holding company fails to maintain a “satisfactory” or better record of performance under the CRA, the financial holding company will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to “satisfactory” or better, from engaging in new activities authorized particularly for financial holding companies or acquiring companies engaged in such activities.\nLimitations on Acquisitions of Our Common Stock.   The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons acting in concert from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the Federal Reserve has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition by a person or group of persons acting in concert of 10% or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act constitutes the acquisition of control of a bank holding company for purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act. On July 30, 2024, the FDIC approved a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the FDIC’s rules implementing the Change in Bank Control Act. If adopted, the proposed rule would eliminate an exemption from prior notice to the FDIC for a proposed change in control involving the acquisition of voting securities of a depository institution holding company for which the Federal Reserve reviews a notice pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act. As a result, if the proposed rule is adopted, the acquisition of control of a bank holding company for an insured state nonmember bank would require prior notice to both the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. In addition, the BHCA prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company without first having obtained the approval of the Federal Reserve. Under the BHCA, a company is deemed to control a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company, controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company, or the Federal Reserve determines that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or bank holding company. Under a rebuttable presumption of control established by the Federal Reserve, the acquisition of control of more than 5% of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company, together with other factors enumerated by the Federal Reserve, could constitute the acquisition of control of a bank holding company under the BHCA. \nBank Regulation.   SoFi Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC. Additionally, the FDIC has secondary supervisory authority as the insurer of SoFi Bank’s deposits. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve may directly examine the subsidiaries of the Company, including SoFi Bank. The enforcement powers available to the federal banking regulators include, among other things, the ability to issue cease and desist or removal orders, to terminate insurance of deposits, to assess civil money penalties, to issue directives to increase capital, to place SoFi Bank into receivership, and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties.\nCFPB Regulation.   Beginning January 1, 2024, SoFi Bank and its affiliates became subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. Under the Trump administration, the CFPB’s supervisory and enforcement activities are undergoing material changes.\nDeposit Insurance.   Deposit obligations of SoFi Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund up to $250,000 per depositor. Deposit insurance premiums are based on assets, while taking into account various factors, including certain financial metrics and a bank’s supervisory ratings. The FDIC has the authority to adjust deposit insurance assessment rates at any time. Further, through SoFi Money, members have access to expanded FDIC insurance coverage of up to $2 million through a reciprocal deposit network of participating banks in our Insured Deposit Program. Under the FDIA, insurance of \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\ndeposits may be terminated by the FDIC if the FDIC finds that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. For 2024, the FDIC insurance expense for SoFi Bank was $12.4 million.\nActivities and Investments of National Banking Associations.   National banking associations must comply with the National Bank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the OCC, which generally limit the activities of national banking associations to those that are deemed to be part of, or incidental to, the “business of banking”. Activities that are part of, or incidental to, the business of banking include taking deposits, borrowing and lending money and discounting or negotiating promissory notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and other evidences of debt. Subsidiaries of national banking associations generally may only engage in activities permissible for the parent national bank.\nAcquisitions and Branching. Prior approval from the OCC is required in order for SoFi Bank to acquire another bank or establish a new branch office. Well capitalized and well managed banks may acquire other banks in any state, subject to certain deposit concentration limits and other conditions, pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nBrokered Deposits. The FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized” or, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” Certain depository institutions that have brokered deposits in excess of 10% of total assets are subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments; however, for institutions that are “well capitalized” and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, reciprocal deposits are deducted from brokered deposits. Section 202 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Economic Growth Act”), which was enacted in 2018, amended the FDIA to exempt a capped amount of reciprocal deposits from treatment as brokered deposits for certain insured depository institutions.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act.   The CRA requires the OCC to evaluate SoFi Bank’s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of the entire communities it serves, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with its safe and sound banking operation. A bank’s performance under the CRA is taken into consideration when evaluating and approving applications for charters, bank mergers, acquisitions, and branch openings. On January 1, 2023, SoFi Bank began operating under a five-year CRA strategic plan which includes measurable goals relating to: (i) CD Lending and CD Investments, (ii) CD Contributions, (iii) CD Services, (iv) Small Business Lending, and (v) Retail Services and Products. SoFi Bank’s 2023-2027 CRA performance will be examined based upon the CRA strategic plan’s five measurable goals as defined in the strategic plan and, as a result, the OCC’s standard performance evaluation criteria will not be utilized to evaluate SoFi Bank’s CRA performance throughout the duration of the strategic plan period. The OCC rates a national bank’s compliance with the CRA as “Outstanding”, “Satisfactory”, “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance”. On October 23, 2023, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC approved changes to their CRA regulations, maintaining the existing CRA ratings (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, and Substantial Noncompliance) but modifying the evaluation framework to replace the existing tests generally applicable to banks with at least $2 billion in assets (the lending, investment, and services tests) with four new tests and associated performance metrics. On February 5, 2024, the American Bankers Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Independent Community Bankers of America, along with four state trade associations jointly sued the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of Comptroller of the Currency for exceeding their statutory authority in adopting revised regulations to implement the Community Reinvestment Act. The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas requested the regulatory agencies vacate the rule and sought a preliminary injunction pausing the new rules while the court decided the merits of the case. On March 29, 2024, the district court judge granted a temporary injunction to pause the implementation of CRA final rule with respect to the plaintiff trade associations while the case moves forward. The banking agencies have appealed the issuance of the injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The new CRA regulations are currently expected to become effective on January 1, 2026. Failure of SoFi Bank to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit SoFi Bank or the Company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions of other financial institutions. Golden Pacific Bank, the predecessor to SoFi Bank, received a “Satisfactory” rating as of April 1, 2019.\nLending Restrictions. Federal law limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to directors and executive officers of the bank or its affiliates and persons or companies that own, control or have power to vote more than 10% of any class of securities of a bank or an affiliate of a bank, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. The terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nLending Obligations.  Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), like the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), are financial services corporations created by Congress to enhance the flow of credit to specific sectors of the economy. GSEs invest in and purchase mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage market. This process helps provide liquidity to mortgage lenders like SoFi Bank, enabling them to continue offering loans to more buyers. The GSEs impose prescriptive rules, underwriting criteria, servicing standards, repurchase obligations, and other guidelines on mortgage lenders who originate mortgage loans in which the GSEs invest. GSEs invest in some of the mortgage loans that SoFi Bank originates. Therefore, SoFi Bank must make certain representations and warranties to those GSEs, and comply with those rules and guidelines. Similarly, because we offer certain government-backed loans (e.g., Veterans Affairs (VA) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans) to eligible borrowers purchasing a home or refinancing an existing mortgage, we must comply with applicable VA and FHA rules and guidelines with respect to those loans.\nEnhanced Prudential Supervision. Both SoFi Bank and the Company, which controls SoFi Bank, had total consolidated assets in excess of $10 billion as of December 31, 2024 which subjects them to additional regulatory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal banking laws. \nSection 1025 of the Dodd-Frank Act and the CFPB’s interpretations thereof provide that the CFPB has authority to examine any insured depository institution and with total assets of more than $10 billion for four consecutive quarters and any affiliate thereof. Beginning January 1, 2024, SoFi Bank and its affiliates became subject to CFPB supervision and regulation with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive.\nSection 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is commonly known as the “Durbin Amendment”, amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to restrict the amount of interchange fees that may be charged and prohibit network exclusivity for debit card transactions. The restrictions on interchange fees became applicable to SoFi Bank on July 1, 2023, which may negatively impact future interchange fees.\nIn addition, Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the “Volcker Rule”, which generally prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in or sponsoring certain types of investment funds, applies to insured depository institutions if it, and every company that controls it, has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more and consolidated trading assets and liabilities that are 5% or more of consolidated assets. The Volcker Rule, while applicable, does not significantly impact the operations of the Company and SoFi Bank, as we do not engage in a significant amount of activity that is subject to the Volcker Rule.\nFinally, Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, and 12 C.F.R. Part 30 require the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively, to implement enhanced prudential regulation applicable to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $100 billion or more and national banks with total assets of $50 billion or more. The enhanced prudential standards include risk-based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management, and stress-test requirements. Once the Company’s or SoFi Bank’s assets are equal to or greater than the applicable asset thresholds, we will be subject to these enhanced prudential regulations.\nCapital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness\nRegulatory Capital Requirements.   The Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital rules applicable to U.S. banking organizations such as the Company and SoFi Bank. These rules are intended to reflect the relationship between the banking organization’s capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet items. The Federal Reserve and the OCC may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization’s financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.\nThe capital adequacy rules define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally includes common stock and related surplus, retained earnings and, in certain cases and subject to certain limitations, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other deductions. Tier 1 capital for banks and bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of common equity Tier 1 capital, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus and, in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries that do not qualify as common equity Tier 1 capital, less certain deductions. Tier 2 capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, term \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nsubordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, and, subject to limitations, allowances for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital less certain required deductions represents qualifying total risk-based capital.\nUnder the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and total capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned to one of several categories of risk weights based primarily on relative credit risk. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by average assets, less certain items such as goodwill and intangible assets, as permitted under the capital rules.\nUnder the Federal Reserve’s rules that are applicable to the Company and the OCC’s capital rules applicable to SoFi Bank, the Company and SoFi Bank are each required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.0%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 4.0%. Additionally, these rules require an institution to establish a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions of more than 2.5% of total risk weighted assets, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses and to engage in share repurchases. \nUnder the OCC’s prompt corrective action rules, an OCC supervised institution is considered well capitalized if it: (i) has a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.0% or greater, (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.0% or greater, (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater, and (v) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. SoFi Bank is considered well capitalized under all regulatory definitions. \nGenerally, a bank, upon receiving notice that it is not adequately capitalized (i.e., that it is “undercapitalized”), becomes subject to the prompt corrective action provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA that, for example: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees, (ii) require that its federal bank regulator monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital, (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan, (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets, and (v) require prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals. A bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guarantee by each company that controls the bank. A bank that is “critically undercapitalized” (i.e., has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%) will be subject to further restrictions, and generally will be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days.\nCurrent capital rules do not establish standards for determining whether a bank holding company is well capitalized. However, for purposes of processing regulatory applications and notices, the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y provides that a bank holding company is considered “well capitalized” if: (i) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, (ii) on a consolidated basis, the bank holding company maintains a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, and (iii) the bank holding company is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.\nSafety and Soundness Standard. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies pursuant to the FDIA establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, and compensation and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the federal banking agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order restricting asset growth, requiring an institution to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets or directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “Regulatory Capital Requirements” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.\nDividend Restrictions\nThe Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The right of the Company, and consequently the right of shareholders of the Company, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiaries through \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nthe payment of dividends or otherwise is subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiaries, including, with respect to SoFi Bank, depositors of SoFi Bank, except to the extent that certain claims of the Company in a creditor capacity may be recognized.\nRestrictions on Bank Holding Company Dividends. The Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends on regulatory capital instruments unless the bank holding company’s net income over the preceding year is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, under Federal Reserve policy, the Company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend on regulatory capital instruments that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the Company’s capital structure. Further, under the Federal Reserve’s capital rules, the Company’s ability to pay dividends is restricted if it does not maintain capital above the capital conservation buffer. See “Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above.\nRestrictions on Bank Dividends. The OCC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. In addition, under the National Bank Act, SoFi Bank generally may, without prior approval of the OCC, declare a dividend so long as the total amount of all dividends (common and preferred), including the proposed dividend, in the current year do not exceed net income for the current year to date plus retained net income for the prior two years.\nCertain Transactions by Bank Holding Companies with their Affiliates\nThere are various statutory restrictions on the extent to which bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries may borrow, obtain credit from or otherwise engage in “covered transactions” with their insured depository institution subsidiaries. An insured depository institution (and its subsidiaries) may not lend money to, or engage in covered transactions with, its non-depository institution affiliates if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding involving the bank, plus the proposed transaction exceeds the following limits: (i) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution, and (ii) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution. For this purpose, “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate; a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless exempted by the Federal Reserve; the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company; the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate; securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate; or a derivatives transaction with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate. Covered transactions are also subject to certain collateral security requirements. Covered transactions as well as other types of transactions between a bank and a bank holding company must be conducted under terms and conditions, including credit standards, which are at least as favorable to the bank as prevailing market terms. Moreover, Section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 provides that, to further competition, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or the furnishing of any service.\nConsumer Financial Services Laws and Regulations \nWe are subject to federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair or deceptive business practices. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices, which can be referred to as “UDAAP”, and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. Prior to January 1, 2024, the OCC examined SoFi Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and enforced CFPB rules with respect to SoFi Bank. As noted above, beginning January 1, 2024, SoFi Bank and its affiliates became subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB as an insured depository institution with total assets of more than $10 billion.\nTruth in Lending Act.   The TILA and Regulation Z, which implements it, require lenders to provide consumers with uniform, understandable information concerning certain terms and conditions of their loan and credit transactions prior to the consummation of a credit transaction and, in the case of certain education, mortgage, personal, credit card, overdraft, and other open-end loans, at the time of a loan solicitation, application, approval and origination of a credit transaction. TILA also \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nregulates the advertising of credit, including limitations on co-branding private education lender’s products with educational institutions in the marketing of private education loans, and gives borrowers, among other things, certain rights regarding updated disclosures and periodic statements, security interests taken to secure the credit, the right to rescind certain loan transactions, a right to an investigation and resolution of billing errors, and the treatment of credit balances. For certain types of credit transactions, lenders are not permitted to originate loans with certain high-risk features, such as negative amortization and balloon payments, and must provide certain consumer protections during the underwriting and origination process, such as providing a right to an appraisal of mortgaged property, and verifying the consumer’s ability to repay the loan prior to making a decision to approve an application for the loan. Private education lenders must provide multiple disclosures to applicants under TILA and must provide applicants with 30 days in which to accept or reject a loan offer as well as the right to rescind the loan transaction for three business days following receipt of the Final TILA disclosure. \nReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act.   The federal RESPA and Regulation X, which implements it, require certain disclosures to be made to the borrower at application, as to the lender’s initial disclosures (or good faith estimate) of loan origination costs, and at closing with respect to the real estate settlement statement; apply to certain loan servicing practices including escrow accounts, member complaints, servicing transfers, lender-placed insurance, error resolution and loss mitigation. RESPA also prohibits giving or accepting any fee, kickback or a thing of value for the referral of real estate settlement services, and giving or accepting any portion of any fee charged for rendering a real estate settlement service other than for services actually performed. To the extent that a lender makes or receives a referral to a third-party with whom it has an affiliated business arrangement, for settlement services, RESPA requires a disclosure to the customer of the affiliation to the service provider. For most home loans, the time of application (loan estimate) and time of loan closing disclosure requirements for RESPA and TILA have been combined into integrated disclosures under the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule. \nEqual Credit Opportunity Act.   The federal ECOA prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, marital status, the fact that all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act or any applicable state law. Regulation B, which implements ECOA, restricts creditors from requesting certain types of information from loan applicants and from using advertising or making statements that would discourage on a prohibited basis a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application. ECOA also requires creditors to provide consumers and certain small businesses with timely responses to applications for credit, including notices of adverse action taken on credit applications. \nFair Housing Act.   The federal FHA applies to credit related to housing and prohibits discrimination on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and handicap. The FHA prohibits discrimination in advertising regarding the sale or rental of a dwelling, which includes mortgage credit discrimination. The FHA may place restrictions on a creditor’s targeted marketing strategies, due to the risk that such strategies may increase a creditor’s fair lending risk. \nHome Mortgage Disclosure Act.   The federal HMDA requires lenders to collect, report and disclose certain information about their mortgage lending activity to the CFPB. Much of the data reported pursuant to HMDA is made public and can be used by regulators and third parties to ascertain information about our mortgage lending activity. Regulators and litigants may use the data to make inferences about our compliance with ECOA, FHA and similar anti-discrimination laws. Effective in 2018, the CFPB issued a final rule which greatly expanded the amount of data that mortgage lenders are required to collect and report under HMDA.\nSecure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act.   We employ and contract with mortgage loan originators which are required by state and federal law to be licensed as mortgage loan originators in the relevant jurisdictions where they operate. To obtain and maintain licensure, the mortgage loan originator must meet the minimum education, experience and character requirements set forth by the relevant state’s law, and periodically renew their licenses. We may not be permitted to employ, take applications from, or originate loans processed by mortgage loan originators who fail to maintain a license in good standing in each relevant jurisdiction. \nFair Credit Reporting Act.   The federal FCRA, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. FCRA requires a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer credit report and requires persons that furnish loan payment information to credit bureaus to report such information accurately. We are also required to perform a reasonable investigation in the event we receive indirect disputes from the credit bureaus about the accuracy of our credit reporting for a particular consumer and to update any inaccurate information we discover. FCRA also imposes disclosure requirements on creditors who take adverse action on credit applications based on information contained in a consumer report or received from a third party and requires creditors who use consumer reports in establishing loan terms to provide risk-based pricing or credit score notices to affected consumers. FCRA also imposes rules and disclosure requirements on creditors’ use of consumer reports for marketing \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\npurposes, which impacts our ability to use consumer reports and prescreened lists to market consumer loans through direct mail and other means. \nFair Debt Collection Practices Act.   The federal FDCPA provides guidelines and limitations on the conduct of third-party debt collectors in connection with the collection of consumer debts. The FDCPA limits certain communications with third parties, imposes notice and debt validation requirements, and prohibits threatening, harassing or abusive conduct in the course of debt collection. While the FDCPA applies to third-party debt collectors, and not original creditors, debt collection and loan servicing laws of certain states impose similar requirements on creditors who collect their own debts or contract with third parties to collect their debts. In addition, the CFPB prohibits UDAAP in debt collection, including first-party debt collection. The CFPB’s Regulation F, which implements the FDCPA, addresses communications in connection with debt collection, interprets and applies prohibitions on harassment or abuse, false or misleading representations, and unfair practices in debt collection, and clarifies requirements for certain consumer-facing debt collection disclosures.\nServicemembers Civil Relief Act.   The federal SCRA allows military members to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations so that the military member can devote his or her full attention to military duties. The SCRA requires us to adjust the interest rate of borrowers who qualify for and request relief. The SCRA also places limitations on remedies that may otherwise be available to a creditor, such as foreclosures and default judgments. \nMilitary Lending Act.   The MLA restricts, among other things, the interest rate and other terms that can be offered to active military personnel and their dependents. The MLA caps the interest rate that may be offered to a covered borrower for most types of consumer credit to a 36% military annual percentage rate, or “MAPR”, which includes certain fees such as application fees, participation fees and fees for add-on products. The MLA also requires certain disclosures and prohibits certain terms, such as mandatory arbitration if a dispute arises concerning the consumer credit product. \nExpedited Funds Availability Act. The EFAA and Regulation CC, which implements it, requires us to provide consumers with a schedule of when the funds from deposits they make will become available for use. It requires us to make funds available for consumers no later than on the schedule mandated by Regulation CC, imposes prescriptive rules about our ability to place a hold on a deposit to specific circumstances, for example when we need to research potential fraud, and requires us to provide notice to depositors when a hold is placed.\nTruth in Savings Act. The TISA and Regulation DD, which implements it, require us to provide consumers with certain uniform disclosures to enable consumers to make informed decisions about our deposit offerings and to aid in comparison shopping by informing consumers about the fees, annual percentage yield, interest rate, and other terms for our deposit accounts and related transaction and overdraft features. TISA also regulates the payment of interest, calculating the balance on interest paid, calculating the annual-percentage yield, overdraft features, changes in terms on deposit accounts, and the advertising of deposit accounts and promotional offers.\nElectronic Fund Transfer Act and NACHA Rules.   The federal EFTA, and Regulation E that implements it, provide guidelines and restrictions on the provision of electronic fund transfer services to consumers, and on making an electronic transfer of funds from consumers’ bank accounts. The EFTA and Regulation E require that financial institutions and providers of electronic fund transfer services limit a consumer’s liability for, and reimburse consumers for, fraud and unauthorized transactions, and impose requirements on remittance transfer, P2P transfer, and overdraft features. In addition, transfers performed by electronic transfers using the ACH network are subject to detailed timing and notification rules and guidelines administered by the NACHA. Most transfers of funds in connection with the origination and repayment of loans are performed by electronic fund transfers, such as ACH transfers. We obtain necessary electronic authorization from borrowers and investors for such transfers in compliance with such rules. EFTA requires that lenders make available loan payment methods other than automatic preauthorized electronic fund transfers, and prohibits lenders from conditioning the approval of a loan transaction on the borrower’s agreement to repay the loan through automatic fund transfers. Recently, the NACHA Board of Directors approved a change in the NACHA Operating Rules that requires ACH Originators to perform account validation as part of their commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection systems.\nElectronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act/Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.   The federal ESIGN, and similar state laws, particularly the UETA, authorize the creation of legally binding and enforceable agreements utilizing electronic records and signatures. ESIGN and UETA require businesses that want to use electronic records or signatures in consumer transactions and to provide electronic disclosures and other electronic communications to consumers, to obtain the consumer’s consent to receive information electronically. \nBank Secrecy Act.   We have implemented various anti-money laundering policies and procedures to comply with applicable federal anti-money laundering laws, regulations and requirements, such as designating a BSA officer, conducting an annual risk assessment, developing internal controls, independent testing, training, and suspicious activity monitoring and \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nreporting. We apply the customer identification and verification program rules pursuant to the USA PATRIOT Act amendments to the BSA and its implementing regulations and screen certain customer information against the list of specially designated nationals and other lists of sanctioned countries, persons, and entities maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department’s OFAC. Additionally, SoFi Digital Assets, LLC is registered with and regulated by the FinCEN as a MSB with respect to its digital assets business activities, which were transferred in the first quarter of 2024. As an MSB, we are subject to FinCEN regulations implementing the BSA, which requires MSBs to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records, among other requirements. Similarly, SoFi Bank is a financial institution under the BSA that is required to implement a risk-based anti-money laundering program, including customer identification procedures, currency transaction reporting, suspicious activity monitoring and reporting and other recordkeeping requirements. In addition, our contracts with financial institution partners and other third parties may contractually require us to maintain an anti-money laundering program. \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by OFAC, take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial or other transactions relating to a sanctioned country or with certain designated persons and entities; (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons); and (iii) restrictions on transactions with or involving certain persons or entities. Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company.\nLoan Servicing.   We are subject to CFPB supervision and regulation of our loan servicing activities conducted by SoFi Bank and SoFi Lending Corp. even in scenarios where we have engaged third-party servicers to service our private education loans and home loans. In addition, for so long as SoFi Lending Corp. acts as servicer of any of our private education loans, we are subject to certain state licensing requirements applicable to student loan servicers even though we have engaged third-party servicers to service our private education loans, as we retain master servicing rights. With respect to our broader consumer loan business, we are subject to federal and state laws regulating loan servicers. We are impacted by these rules even though we service loans we originate, and engage third parties to service certain types of loans, because some state laws, such as the California Rosenthal Act, apply to creditors and first party servicers. Some state laws also apply to parties that indirectly service loans through the use of third-party servicer contracts. Additionally, we sell some of the loans we originate to third parties and are therefore subject to laws governing parties that service loans on behalf of another person to whom the debt is owed. We are currently licensed as a loan servicer in several states and may be required to seek additional licenses. If we seek additional licenses, a state has in the past and may in the future impose fines, restrict our activity in that state, or seek other relief for activity conducted prior to the issuance of a license. \nOther State Lending Laws.   SoFi Lending Corp. will continue to service certain of our loans. Consequently, in addition to applicable federal laws and regulations governing our operations, our ability to service loans through SoFi Lending Corp. in any particular state, and transmit money to or from any particular state, is subject to that state’s laws, regulations and licensing requirements, which may differ from the laws, regulations and licensing requirements of other states. State laws often include fee limitations and disclosure and other requirements. Many states have adopted lending regulations that prohibit various forms of high-risk or sub-prime lending and place obligations on lenders to substantiate that a member will derive a tangible benefit from the proposed credit transaction and/or have the ability to repay the loan. These laws have required most lenders to devote considerable resources to building and maintaining automated systems to perform loan-by-loan analysis of points, fees and other factors set forth in the laws, which often vary depending on the location of the mortgaged property. Many of these state lending laws are vague and subject to differing interpretation, which exposes us to some risks. The number and complexity of these laws, and vagaries in their interpretations, present compliance and litigation risks from inadvertent error and omissions which we may not be able to eliminate from our operations or activities. The laws, regulations and rules described above are subject to legislative, administrative and judicial interpretation, and some of these laws and regulations have been infrequently interpreted or only recently enacted. Infrequent interpretations of these laws and regulations or an insignificant number of interpretations of recently-enacted laws and regulations can result in ambiguity with respect to permitted conduct under these laws and regulations. Any ambiguity under the laws and regulations to which we are subject may lead to regulatory investigations or enforcement actions and private causes of action, such as class-action lawsuits, with respect to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nRisk Retention Regulations.   Our balance sheet is impacted by the risk retention regulations adopted by the SEC that became effective for non-mortgage securitizations in 2016. These rules require issuers of asset-backed securities or persons who organize and initiate asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion of the underlying assets’ credit risk. \nMarketing Regulations.   Our marketing and other business practices are subject to federal and state regulation and our expansion into new product offerings, including ETFs and, beginning in January 2024, alternative investment funds, mutual funds and money market funds, under the SoFi Invest product, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny. For example, we and the FTC entered into the FTC Consent Order regarding savings calculations in our student loan refinancing advertisements. In addition, we are subject to the TCPA, which regulates, among other things: (i) the use of automated telephone dialing systems to make certain calls or text messages to cellphones without prior consent, and (ii) certain calls and text messages to numbers properly registered on the federal do not call list without permission or an established business relationship, and the Federal CAN-SPAM Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, and analogous state laws, to the extent that we market credit or other products and services by use of email or telephone marketing. \nBankruptcy Laws.   We are subject to the United States Bankruptcy Code, which limits the extent to which creditors may seek to enforce debts against parties who have filed for bankruptcy protection. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.\nFederal and State Securities Laws.   We offer the securities issued in our sponsored securitizations only to, or for the account or benefit of, “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in compliance with Rule 144A and to “non-U.S. persons” outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The securities issued in the securitizations that we sponsor are not registered under the Securities Act or registered or qualified under any state securities laws. We do not offer securitized products to retail investors. We receive opinions from legal counsel for each securitization confirming that the relevant issuing entity is not required to register under the Investment Company Act in reliance on the exclusion available under Rule 3a-7 of the Investment Company Act, although other exemptions or exceptions may also be available.\nSoFi Invest and SoFi Money.   SoFi Invest is the brand name for the following legal entities: SoFi Wealth LLC, SoFi Capital Advisors, LLC, SoFi Securities, and SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, each of which provides different products and services. We offer investment management services through SoFi Wealth LLC, an internet-based investment adviser and SoFi Capital Advisors, LLC, which provides portfolio management services for pooled investment vehicles that invest in asset-backed securitizations. Both SoFi Wealth LLC and SoFi Capital Advisors, LLC are registered as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and are subject to regulation by the SEC. SoFi Securities is an affiliated registered broker-dealer and FINRA member. We offer cash management accounts, which are brokerage products, through SoFi Securities. Although we have exited our digital assets business, the Company, including SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, may still be subject to regulatory scrutiny related to our prior business practices. \nThe investment advisers are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions, which apply to our relationships with our advisory members, including the funds we manage. These provisions and duties impose restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our members, fund investors and our investments, including, for example, restrictions on transactions with our affiliates. \nOur investment advisers and our broker-dealer have in the past been, and will in the future be, subject to periodic SEC examinations. Our investment advisers and our broker-dealer are also subject to other requirements under the Advisers Act and the Exchange Act, respectively, and related regulations. These additional requirements relate to matters including maintaining effective and comprehensive compliance programs, record-keeping and reporting and disclosure requirements. The Advisers Act and the Exchange Act generally grant the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser or our broker-dealer from conducting advisory or brokerage activities, respectively, in the event they fail to comply with federal securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements include the prohibition of individuals from associating with an investment adviser or broker-dealer, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines. Even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator was small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing members or fail to gain new members. \nSoFi Securities is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act, the “SEC Net Capital Rule”, which requires the maintenance of minimum levels of net capital. The SEC Net Capital Rule is designed to protect members, counterparties, and creditors by requiring a broker-dealer to have sufficient liquid resources available to satisfy its financial obligations. Net capital is a measure of a broker-dealer’s readily available liquid assets, reduced by its total liabilities (other than approved subordinated \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\ndebt). Among other things, the SEC Net Capital Rule requires that a broker-dealer provide notice to the SEC and FINRA if its net capital is below certain required levels. There are also certain “early warning” requirements that apply. Our affiliates operating outside the United States may also be subject to other regulatory capital requirements imposed by non-U.S. regulatory authorities. \nSoFi Securities is a broker-dealer that does not carry customer security accounts; rather, customer security accounts are carried by an unaffiliated broker-dealer that also clears transactions for these accounts and maintains segregated cash and investments pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act (the “Customer Protection Rule”). SoFi Securities carries customer cash accounts (i.e., the SoFi Money cash management accounts) that are subject to the Customer Protection Rule. \nFINRA has adopted extensive regulatory requirements relating to sales practices, registration of personnel, compliance and supervision, and compensation and disclosure, to which SoFi Securities and its personnel are subject. FINRA and the SEC also have the authority to conduct periodic examinations of SoFi Securities, and may also conduct administrative proceedings, and have the authority to levy fines and other penalties on SoFi Securities. \nSoFi Securities is registered with the MSRB and subject to the MSRB’s regulatory regime, including applicable MSRB rules. \nSoFi Securities is a Participant of DTC and is, therefore, subject to DTC’s regulatory regime, including applicable DTC rules and bylaws. \nMoreover, through SoFi Securities, we are licensed to underwrite securities offerings and have served as a firm commitment underwriter of, or as selling agent on, registered equity securities offerings. \nState Licensing Requirements\nOne or more of our subsidiaries may need, and have obtained, one or more state licenses to broker, acquire, service and/or enforce loans. Where we have obtained licenses, state licensing statutes may impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on us, including: \n•record-keeping requirements; \n•restrictions on servicing and collection practices, including limits on finance charges and fees; \n•restrictions on collections; \n•usury rate caps to the extent the non-bank subsidiary originates loans; \n•restrictions on permissible terms in consumer agreements; \n•disclosure requirements; \n•examination requirements; \n•surety bond and minimum net worth requirements; \n•permissible investment requirements; \n•financial reporting requirements; \n•annual or biennial activity reporting and license renewal requirements; \n•notification and approval requirements for changes in principal officers, directors, stock ownership or corporate control; \n•restrictions on marketing and advertising; \n•qualified individual requirements; \n•anti-money laundering and compliance program requirements; \n•data security and privacy requirements; and \n•review requirements for loan forms and other customer-facing documents. \nThese statutes may also subject us to the supervisory and examination authority of state regulators in certain cases, and we have experienced, are currently and will likely continue to be subject to and experience exams by state regulators. These examinations have and may continue to result in findings or recommendations that require us to modify our internal controls and/or business practices. If we are found to have engaged in activities that require a state license without having the requisite \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nlicense, the licensing authority may impose fines, impose restrictions on our operations in the relevant state, or seek other remedies for activities conducted in the state.\nRegulation of Other Activities \nThrough the Company’s website and mobile application under the brand name “SoFi Protect”, we offer members access to multiple insurance products and services, which today include life insurance, auto insurance, homeowners insurance, renters insurance and cyber insurance. All such insurance products are offered through third-party insurance carriers, and may be made available to customers through Social Finance Life Insurance Agency LLC. Certain insurance products may be offered by outside insurance providers through a marketing arrangement with the Company. Social Finance Life Insurance Agency LLC is subject to certain state insurance brokering and agency statutes and regulations.\nPrivacy and Consumer Information Security \nIn the ordinary course of our business, we access, collect, store, use, transmit and otherwise process certain types of data, including personal information, which subjects us to certain federal, state and foreign privacy and information security laws, rules, industry standards and regulations designed to regulate consumer information and data privacy, security and protection, and mitigate identity theft. These laws impose obligations with respect to the collection, processing, storage, disposal, use, transfer, retention and disclosure of personal information, and, with limited exceptions, give consumers the right to prevent use of their personal information and disclosure of it to third parties. The GLBA requires us to disclose certain information sharing practices to consumers, and any subsequent changes to such practices, and provide an opportunity for consumers to opt out of certain sharing of their non-public personal information. This may limit our ability to share personal information with third parties for certain purposes, such as marketing. In addition, the CFPB is expected to issue a new rule regulating the disclosure of consumer information, which may limit our ability to receive or use personal information and other consumer information and records supplied by third parties, or share information with third parties. Further, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted data breach notification laws that impose, in varying degrees, an obligation to notify affected individuals and government authorities in the event of a data or security breach or compromise, including when a consumer’s personal information has or may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. These laws may also require us to notify relevant law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach. Some laws may also impose physical and electronic security requirements regarding the safeguarding of personal information. \nOn January 1, 2020, the CCPA took effect, directly impacting our California business operations and indirectly impacting our operations nationwide. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. While personal information that we process that is subject to the GLBA is exempt from the CCPA, the CCPA regulates other personal information that we collect and process in connection with the business. Effective January 1, 2023, the CPRA, which amended the CCPA, imposed additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also created a new state agency that is vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. \nIn addition to California, several other states have passed comprehensive privacy laws similar to the CCPA. Certain of these laws are in force and others will enter in effect in the coming years. Like the CCPA, these laws create obligations related to the processing of personal information, as well as special obligations for the processing of “sensitive” data. Some of the provisions of these laws may apply to our business activities. There are also states that are strongly considering comprehensive privacy laws and it is anticipated that other states will be considering these laws in the future. Further, Congress has also been debating passing a federal privacy law. In addition, other states have proposed and/or passed legislation that regulates the privacy and/or security of certain specific types of information. For example, a small number of states have passed laws that regulate biometric data specifically and Washington has passed a law that governs health data, with “health data” defined broadly. These various privacy and security laws may impact our business activities, including our identification of research subjects, relationships with business partners and ultimately the marketing and distribution of our products. \nThe existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different U.S. states would make our compliance obligations more complex and costly and may increase the likelihood that we may be subject to enforcement actions, civil litigation or otherwise incur liability for noncompliance.\nOur broker-dealer and investment advisers are subject to SEC Regulation S-P, which requires that these businesses maintain policies and procedures addressing the protection of customer information and records. This includes protecting against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of customer records and information and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information. Regulation S-P also requires these businesses to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers describing information sharing policies and informing customers of their rights. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nOn October 22, 2024, the CFPB finalized a new regulation, implementing personal financial data rights established by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule will require us to make consumers’ data available upon request to consumers and authorized third parties in a secure, reliable manner. It also requires us to implement privacy protections if we seek consumer financial data from another financial institution, as an authorized third party of a consumer. Assuming the new regulation will be permitted to mandate compliance as currently written, the mandated compliance date for depository institutions like SoFi Bank, which hold between $10 billion and $250 billion in total assets, will be April 1, 2027. \nIntellectual PropertyWe seek to protect our intellectual property by relying on a combination of federal, state and common law in the United States, as well as on contractual measures. We use a variety of measures, such as trademarks, trade secrets and patents, to protect our intellectual property. We also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures, a key part of our broader risk management strategy. \nWe have registered several trademarks, including but not limited to: (i) related to our name, “SoFi”, (ii) SoFi’s logo, (iii) our company motto “Get Your Money Right”, and (iv) certain SoFi products, such as “SoFi Money” and “SoFi Invest”. We believe our name, logo, motto and products are important brand identifiers for our members and enterprise partners. In addition, our Technology Platform has been granted several patents.\nOur Culture and Human Capital Resources![alt  SoFi Values.jpg](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000181887425000016/sofi-20241231_g4.jpg)\nBuilding a durable culture is and will continue to be a key determinant in our ability to help our members get their money right and ultimately to achieve our mission. Creating great culture is a journey, not a destination. We challenge our employees to integrate each distinct SoFi value enumerated below into their work.\nThese core values are at the center of how we think about serving our members, building our company, and most importantly, how we work together. At SoFi, we believe our long-term growth and success depend on our ability to attract, develop and retain a high-performing workforce. We believe supporting, developing and inspiring our employees will ultimately unlock the potential of the organization, drive excellence across the business and solidify SoFi as a top career destination where people love to work.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 5,000 employees, of which approximately 76% were located in the United States and 24% were located internationally. None of our U.S. based employees are currently represented by a labor union or have terms of employment that are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not historically experienced any work stoppages.\nAttracting and Retaining Employees \nThe goal of SoFi recruitment efforts is to attract and hire talented individuals in all roles and at all career levels. We strive to provide both external candidates and internal employees who are seeking a different role with challenging and stimulating career opportunities. These opportunities range from internship programs for students to entry-level, management and executive careers. Attracting talent from diverse backgrounds and perspectives is important to us, and aligns with one of our core values. We believe in fostering a strong sense of inclusion and belonging for all employees with a lens on representation. Our culture unlocks collaboration, accelerates creativity, and ultimately enables us to accomplish our mission of helping millions of people achieve financial independence. \nLearning and Employee Development\nWe believe strongly in investing in our employees throughout the employee life cycle. Great care is taken to onboard new hires and set them up for success, both in terms of a broad understanding of SoFi’s mission, values, strategic points of differentiation and products, as well as role-specific learning. To this end, throughout the year we offer ongoing learnings including regular company-level “All Hands” meetings and periodic programming on a diverse range of business topics. To enable continuous learning, we have deployed an enterprise learning management system, which includes access to LinkedIn Learning for continuous professional development.\nWe also offer ongoing learning opportunities for people managers to ensure they are well-equipped to support and develop their teams. This includes periodic training on our core processes such as performance management, compensation planning and internal mobility, and “always on” content deployed through Manager Central, a centralized hub of resources for people managers.\nWe use employee feedback to inform the ongoing development of our employee programs directly. In addition to administering an annual survey to gather input from our global workforce, we also conducted specific surveys to gather direct employee feedback on specific topics.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nOur compensation programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate talented, profoundly qualified and committed individuals who believe in our mission, while rewarding employees for long-term value creation. We have a pay-for-performance culture in which employee compensation is aligned to Company performance, as well as individual contributions and impact. Our long-term incentive program aligns employee compensation to the long-term interests of our shareholders, while encouraging them to think and act like owners. As we continue to evolve our programs and practices, we strive for a fair, competitive, transparent, equitable, and well governed approach in recognizing and rewarding our employees. \nAdditionally, our employees’ and their families health and wellness are integral to SoFi’s success. We have a comprehensive benefits program to support the physical, mental and financial well-being of our employees. For our U.S. based workforce we have one core medical plan in which SoFi pays 95% of the monthly premium and additional medical plans with subsidized premiums. In addition to core medical, we offer fertility and parental benefits to help employees who are looking to grow their family, including a reimbursement solution for eligible family building expenses, a paid parental leave benefit, as well as a partially subsidized back-up family care benefit. To support the mental health of our employees, we offer a benefit that allows them to meet with coaches and clinical care providers at no cost. Our tuition reimbursement and student loan repayment programs in the U.S. provide financial support to our employees, allowing them to advance their education and pay off existing student loan debt. \nOur benefits packages also include, among other things, basic life insurance and supplemental life insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance, a Section 401(k) retirement savings plan, the right to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount through our ESPP, and competitive paid time off. Additionally, our program SoFi Gives is a benefit that provides eligible employees with paid time off to engage in volunteer opportunities within their communities.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Corporate GovernanceSustainable business practices are embedded into our day-to-day operations, as we continue to make critical investments in our team and infrastructure to be further able to scale and support new avenues of growth. We believe this not only aligns with our number one company priority of making our culture better every second, in tandem with our first core value “Putting Our Members’ and Clients’ Interests First”, but also improves our profitability and supports long-term value creation for our shareholders. \nIn August 2024, we published our second comprehensive ESG report which shares how our company priorities, core values, mission and commitments to the communities we serve shape how we do business, support our employees, and create a meaningful and lasting impact for our members and customers. This report covers a broad set of ESG-related efforts which have been key to informing our approach, including our people programs, product development processes, community investments and social impact, environmental footprint, corporate governance strategies, risk management operations, public policy initiatives and more. In addition, we have an ESG Committee comprised of key management stakeholders who are tasked with tracking our progress within our ESG initiatives using real world, data-based metrics, as well as devising and executing strategies to create an even greater impact. \nThis and any other ESG-related reports and information included on our investor relations website are not incorporated by reference into, and do not form any part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAdditional InformationAdditional information about SoFi is available on our corporate website at https://www.sofi.com, as well as SoFi’s Investor Relations website at https://investors.sofi.com. \nWe use our website to distribute company information, including financial and other material information. We make available free of charge, on or through our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, beneficial ownership reports on Forms 3 and 4, as well as other filings and any amendments to these documents, as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

In addition, in recent years, we have rapidly expanded our operations to include or expand, among other things, deposit accounts, credit cards, investment services, technology solutions, home loan originations, small business financing solutions, loan platform business solutions, alternative investments, and international operations, and we have limited experience in these areas. In the first quarter of 2022, we acquired a bank charter and face risks as a result of our lack of experience operating a bank and as a bank holding company. We also acquired Technisys in the first quarter of 2022, which furthered our international expansion into Latin America and introduced new risks due to our limited history of operations in certain Latin American countries. In 2023, we acquired Wyndham, a fintech mortgage lender, which expanded our home loan business. In 2024, we adopted our Technology Platform’s Cyberbank Core in connection with the launch of a commercial payment services sponsor bank program.\nIn addition to the events above, we face numerous challenges to our success, including our ability to: \n•increase or maintain the number, volume and types of, and add new features to, the loans we extend to our members as the market for loans evolves and as we face new and increasing competitive threats;\n•successfully integrate our past and future acquisitions, including continuing to develop Wyndham’s technology, performing functions in home loans origination, such as home loans processing and underwriting, and managing the origination of new home loan types;\n•increase the number of members utilizing our non-lending products, including our direct deposit feature, and maintain and build on the loyalty of existing members by increasing their use of new or additional products;\n•continue to increase our fee-based revenue within our Loan Platform Business, including fees earned for originating loans on behalf of third-party partners and fees earned for referring loans to be originated by third party partners;\n•successfully maintain and enhance our diversified funding strategy, including through deposits, securitization financing from consolidated and nonconsolidated VIEs, whole loan sales, and debt warehouse facilities;\n•further establish, diversify and refine our checking and savings, credit card, investment and brokerage offerings to meet evolving consumer needs and preferences;\n•offer an attractive annual percentage yield on our deposits compared to our competitors and manage deposit costs;\n•diversify our revenue streams across our products and services;\n•favorably compete as a service provider with other companies and banks, including traditional and alternative technology-enabled lenders, financial service providers, broker-dealers, social media and other commerce platforms and applications that offer peer-to-peer, in-app and social commerce payment capabilities, and technology platform;\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n•continue to realize the benefits of operating a bank;\n•introduce new products or other offerings, as well as new or improved technologies, to meet the needs of our existing and prospective members or to keep pace with competitive lending, checking and savings, credit card, investment, technology and other developments;

\n•maintain successful relationships with our governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities, as well as self-regulatory agencies; and \n•anticipate and react to changes in an evolving regulatory and political environment. \nWe may not be able to successfully address the risks and uncertainties we face, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects. \nWe have a history of losses and may experience net losses in the future and there is no assurance that our revenue and business model will be successful. \nWe have a history of net losses prior to the fourth quarter of 2023. We may incur net losses in the future, and any such losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We will need to continue to generate and sustain significant revenues for our business generally and achieve greater scale and generate increasing operating cash flows from our Financial Services segment, in particular, in future periods, as well as successfully navigate the macroeconomic environment, in order to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We intend to continue to invest in new products and businesses, which has in the past and may in the future cause us to fund and operate aspects of our business at a loss. We also intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing, technology, and additional products and services in order to enhance our brand, our brand recognition and our value proposition to our members, prospective members and clients in our technology platform business, and these additional costs will create further challenges to maintaining or increasing near-term profitability. Our general and administrative expenses have in the past and may in the future increase to meet the increased compliance and other requirements associated with operating as a public company and a bank holding company, operating a bank, and evolving regulatory requirements and policy changes. See “Regulatory, Tax and Other Legal Risks—As a bank holding company, we are subject to extensive supervision and \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nregulation, and changes in laws and regulations applicable to bank holding companies could limit or restrict our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our operations”.\nWe are continuously refining our revenue and business model, which is premised on creating a virtuous cycle for our members to engage with more products across our platform, a strategy we refer to as the Financial Services Productivity Loop, and, with respect to our Technology Platform segment, adoption by clients of additional platform as a service offerings. There is no assurance that our revenue and business model, or any changes to our revenue and business model to better position us with respect to our competitors, will be successful. Our efforts to continue to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue sufficiently to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur future losses and we may be unable to maintain profitability, for a number of reasons, including the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, differences between our assumptions and estimates and results, the effects of macroeconomic conditions and other unknown events. \nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent years, including through the addition of new products and lines of business and entry into new geographies, which may place significant demands on our operational, risk management, sales and marketing, technology, compliance, and finance and accounting resources. \nOur rapid growth in certain areas of our business in recent years, primarily within our Financial Services and Technology Platform segments, as well as operating a bank and as a bank holding company, has placed significant demands on our operational, risk management, sales and marketing, technology, compliance, and finance and accounting infrastructure, and has resulted in increased expenses, a trend that we expect to continue as our business grows. In addition, we are required to continuously develop and adapt our systems and infrastructure in response to the increasing sophistication of the consumer financial services market, changing technologies, evolving fraud, privacy and information security landscape, and regulatory developments, both domestically and internationally, relating to our existing and projected business activities. Our future growth will depend on, among other things, our ability to maintain an operating platform and management system able to address such growth, our ability to grow and optimize deposit balances, and our ongoing ability to demonstrate to our regulators that our risk management and compliance practices are growing and evolving in a commensurate fashion, all of which has required, and we expect will continue to require, us to incur significant additional expenses, expand our workforce and commit additional time from senior management and operational resources. We may not be able to manage supporting and expanding our operations effectively, and any failure to do so would adversely affect our ability to increase the scale of our business, generate projected revenue and control expenses. \nOur results of operations and future prospects depend on our ability to retain existing members and attract new members. We face intense and increasing competition and, if we do not compete effectively, our competitive positioning and our operating results will be harmed. \nWe operate in a rapidly changing and highly competitive industry, and our results of operations and future prospects depend on, among others:\n•the continued growth and engagement of our member base;\n•our ability to further monetize our member base, including through the use of additional products by our existing members;\n•our ability to acquire members at a lower cost; and\n•our ability to increase the overall value to us of each of our members while they remain on our platform (which we refer to as a member’s lifetime value).\nWe expect our competition to continue to increase, as there are no substantial barriers to entry to certain of the markets we serve. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, particularly with respect to our financial services products, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, and a larger customer base than we do. This allows them to potentially offer more competitive pricing or other terms or features, a broader range of financial products, or a more specialized set of specific products or services, as well as respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in member preferences. In addition to established enterprises, we may also face competition from early-stage companies attempting to capitalize on the same, or similar, opportunities as we are. Our existing or future competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. This could attract current or potential members away from our services and reduce our market share in the future. Additionally, when new competitors seek to enter our markets, or when existing market participants seek to increase their market share, these competitors sometimes undercut, or otherwise exert pressure on, the pricing terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our market share and/or our ability to capitalize on market opportunities. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nWe currently compete at multiple levels with a variety of competitors, including: \n•other personal loan, student loan refinancing, in-school student loan and home loan lenders, including other banks and other financial institutions, as well as credit card issuers, that can offer more competitive interest rates or terms; \n•banks and other financial institutions, with respect to our checking and savings accounts; \n•rewards credit cards provided by other financial institutions, with respect to our SoFi Credit Card;\n•other brokerage firms, including online or mobile platforms, and other companies for our SoFi Invest accounts; \n•other mortgage lenders, including fintech-focused lenders, and other companies for our home loans;\n•social media and other commerce platforms and applications that offer peer-to-peer, in-app and social commerce payment capabilities;\n•other technology platforms with respect to the enterprise services we provide, such as technology products and solutions via Galileo and Technisys;\n•other content providers for subscribers to our financial services content, including content from alternative providers available to our subscribers through our Lantern service, which is a financial services aggregator providing marketplace lending products, and various enterprise partnerships; and \n•other financial services firms offering employers a comprehensive platform for employees to build financial well-being through student loan and 529 educational plan contributions, educational tools, and financial resources, all of which we provide through SoFi At Work.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including, among others, the following: \n•the size, diversity and lifetime value of our member base and technology platform clients; \n•our ability to introduce successful new products and services, as well as new or improved technologies, or to iterate and innovate on existing products or services to satisfy evolving member and technology platform client preferences or to keep pace with market trends;\n•our ability to diversify our revenue streams across our products and services, and cost effectively acquire new members and technology platform clients;\n•the timing and market acceptance of our products and services, including developments and enhancements to those products and services, offered by us and our competitors;\n•member and technology platform client service and support efforts; \n•selling, marketing and promotional efforts; \n•our ability to continue to expand the Loan Platform Business with existing and new loan origination partners;\n•our ability to continue to increase our fee-based revenue and diversify our revenue base;\n•our ability to compete on price, particularly with respect to SoFi Invest and the Technology Platform where demand for our products and services may be affected if we are unable to compete with other brokerages or technology-as-a-service providers on price;\n•our ability to offer competitive interest rates on deposit accounts;\n•the ease of use, performance, price and reliability of solutions developed either by us or our competitors; \n•our ability to attract and retain talent;\n•changes in economic conditions, and regulatory and policy developments; \n•our ability to successfully operate a national bank, grow deposits and realize the potential benefits to our members; \n•our ability to successfully scale our products and services and execute on our Financial Services Productivity Loop strategy and our other business plans, including successfully integrating our acquisitions and diversifying our technology platform clients into new industry verticals and new geographies; \n•general market conditions and their impact on our liquidity and ability to access funding; \n•the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including changes in interest rates, stock market volatility, changes in consumer confidence, consumer discretionary spending, and any changes in loan default rates, and related developments on the lending and financial services markets we serve; and \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n•our brand strength relative to our competitors. \nOur current and future business prospects demand that we act to meet these competitive challenges but, in doing so, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if we, for example, increase marketing or other expenditures or make new expenditures in other areas. Competitive pressures could also result in us reducing the annual percentage rate on the loans we originate, increasing the annual percentage rate we pay on the checking and savings product, charging fees for services we currently provide for free, incurring higher member or technology platform client acquisition costs, or make it more difficult for us to grow our loan originations in both number of loans and volume for new as well as existing members or expand the adoption of additional products by our current, or acquire new, technology platform clients. All of the foregoing factors and events could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects. \nIncreased market volatility and adverse changes in financial market conditions may increase our market risk.\nOur liquidity, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition are affected by market risks such as changes in interest rates, fluctuations in equity, commodity and futures prices, the implied volatility of interest rates and credit spreads and other economic and business factors. These market risks may adversely affect, among other things, the value of our securities, the cost of debt capital and our access to credit markets, customer allocation of capital among investment alternatives, and our competitiveness with respect to deposit pricing, and may negatively impact customer confidence in the safety and soundness of banks. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, which may limit the effectiveness of our strategies to manage these risks. \nOur future growth depends significantly on our branding and marketing efforts, and if our marketing efforts are not successful or we receive negative publicity, our business and results of operations will be harmed. \nWe have invested significantly in our brand and believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand identity is critical to our success. Our ability to attract members depends in large part on the success of these marketing efforts and the success of the marketing channels we use to promote our products. Our marketing channels include, but are not limited to, earned media through press, social media and search engine optimization, as well as paid advertising, such as online affiliations, search engine marketing, digital marketing, social media marketing, influencer marketing, offline partnerships, out-of-home, direct mail, lifecycle marketing and television and radio advertising. Our ability to compete for, attract and maintain members, lending counterparties, marketing partners and other partners relies to a large extent on their trust in our business, our reputation and the value of our brand. While our goal remains to increase the strength, recognition and trust in our brand by increasing our member base and expanding our products and services, if any of our current marketing channels becomes less effective, if regulatory requirements, including the CFPB and FDIC’s advertising rules, restrict or diminish our ability to use these channels, if we are unable to continue to use any of these channels, if we receive negative publicity or fail to maintain our brand, if the cost of using these channels significantly increases or if we are not successful in generating new channels, we may not be able to attract new members or increase the activity of our existing members on our platform in a cost-effective manner. For example, in February 2024, the CFPB released a Consumer Financial Protection Circular, warning digital comparison-shopping tool operators and lead generators that marketing practices that take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s reasonable reliance on the operator or lead generator to act in the consumer’s interests may violate the CFPA prohibition on abusive acts or practices. Such unreasonable advantage can include distorting the shopping experience for a consumer financial product or service by giving preferential treatment to an operator or lead generator’s own or other products or services through steering or enhanced product placement, for financial or other benefits. If we are unable to recover our marketing costs through increases in the size, value or the overall number of loans we originate, or member selection and utilization of other SoFi products such as SoFi Money, SoFi Invest and SoFi Credit Card, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects. In addition, negative publicity can adversely affect our reputation and damage our brand, and may arise from many sources, including actual or alleged misconduct, errors or improper business practices by employees, employee claims of discrimination or harassment, product failures, existing or future litigation or regulatory actions, inadequate protection of consumer information by us or our third-party service providers, data breaches, matters related to or affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and Nasdaq listing requirements and media coverage, whether accurate or not. Negative publicity or allegations could reduce demand for our products, result in a decrease in the price of our stock, undermine the loyalty of our members and the confidence of our lending counterparties and technology platform clients, impact our partnerships, reduce our ability to recruit and retain employees or lead to greater regulatory scrutiny, all of which could lead to the attrition of our members, lending counterparties, and/or technology platform clients and harm our results of operations. In addition, we and our officers, directors and/or employees have been, and may in the future be, named or otherwise involved in litigation or claims, including employment-related claims such as workplace discrimination or harassment, which could result in negative publicity and/or adversely impact our business, even if we are ultimately successful in defending against or litigating such claims.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nReputational harm, including as a result of our actual or alleged conduct or public opinion of the financial services industry generally, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. \nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business and has increased substantially because of our size and profile in the financial services industry. Moreover, negative public opinion has in the past and could in the future result from actions by the financial services industry generally, including due to the failure of one or more additional banks, or by certain members or individuals in the industry and can adversely affect our reputation with no actual or alleged actions on our part. For example, public opinion of the financial services industry was negatively impacted following the 2023 closures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank and generally resulted in decreases in the stock prices of financial services companies.\nNegative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including sales and marketing practices; home loan or other consumer lending practices; loan origination or servicing activities; mortgage foreclosure actions; management of client accounts or investments; lending, investing or other business relationships; identification and management of potential conflicts of interest from transactions; obligations and interests with and among our members or customers; environmental, social and governance practices; litigation or regulatory actions taken by us or to which we are a party; regulatory compliance; risk management; incentive compensation practices; and disclosure, sharing or inadequate protection or improper use of member or customer information, and from actions taken by government regulators and community or other organizations in response to that conduct. Although we have policies and procedures in place intended to detect and prevent conduct by employees and third-party service providers that could potentially harm members or customers or our reputation, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will be fully effective in preventing such conduct.\nFurthermore, our actual or perceived failure to address or prevent any such conduct or otherwise to effectively manage our business or operations could result in significant reputational harm. For example, our marketing strategy includes an emphasis on social media. Social media provides a powerful medium for consumers, employees and others to communicate their approval of or displeasure with a business. This aspect of social media is especially challenging because it allows any individual to reach a broad audience with an ability to respond or react, in near real time, with comments that are often not filtered or checked for accuracy. We monitor social media metrics for their impact on our business but if we are unable to quickly and effectively respond, any negative publicity could “go viral”, causing nearly immediate and potentially significant harm to our brand and reputation, and our business, whether or not factually accurate, including a significant withdrawal of deposits from SoFi Bank within a short period of time.\nOur reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nWe communicate certain ESG-related initiatives regarding our employees, climate-related commitments and goals, and other matters in our ESG Report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These initiatives and commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our ESG-related initiatives or commitments. In addition, we could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. To the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about ESG matters change, we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures. Our actual or perceived failure with respect to our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments could negatively impact our reputation, result in ESG-focused investors not purchasing and holding our stock, or otherwise materially harm our business.\nWe may be unable to satisfactorily meet evolving standards, regulations and disclosure requirements related to ESG. For example, a number of state legislators and regulators have adopted or are currently considering proposing or adopting other rules, regulations, directives, initiatives and laws requiring ESG-related disclosures or conduct, including California laws S.B. 253, S.B. 261 and A.B. 1305. The adoption of these and similar laws could require us to, among other things, expend material capital resources in connection with such compliance efforts. Furthermore, there continues to be a lack of consistent proposed climate change and ESG-related legislation and guidance, which creates regulatory and economic uncertainty. Such matters can affect the willingness or ability of investors to make an investment in our Company, as well as our ability to meet regulatory requirements. Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving regulations and industry standards could have an adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, in recent years “anti-ESG” sentiment has gained momentum across the U.S., with several states and Congress having proposed or enacted “anti-ESG” policies, legislation, or initiatives or issued related legal opinions, and President Trump having recently issued an executive order discouraging diversity equity and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives in the private sector. Such anti-ESG and anti-DEI-related policies, legislation, initiatives, litigation, legal opinions, and scrutiny could result in volatility of our stock price and the Company facing additional compliance obligations, becoming the subject of investigations and enforcement actions, or sustaining reputational harm.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nWe may experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. \nWe may experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including changes in the fair values of our instruments (including, but not limited to, our loans), the level of our expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets, general economic conditions, significant changes in default rates on loans, the rate and credit market environment and our ability to raise our coupon rates along with interest rates that are higher than those in the recent past, legal or regulatory developments, changing demographics, and legislative, regulatory or policy changes. In light of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. \nWe sell our loans to a concentrated number of whole loan purchasers and the loss of one or more significant purchasers could have a negative impact on our operating results. \nAlthough we continue to hold loans on-balance sheet for longer periods, when we sell our personal loans, student loans and home loans, we sell to a concentrated number of whole loan purchasers. There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of a business is concentrated with a limited number of parties. It is not possible for us to predict the future level of demand for our loans by these or other purchasers. In addition, purchases of our loans by these purchasers have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate based on a number of factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including economic conditions, the availability of alternative investments, changes in the terms of the loans, loans offered by competitors, prevailing interest rates and a change in business plan, liquidity or strategy by the purchaser. If any of these purchasers significantly reduces the dollar amount of the loans it purchases from us, we may be unable to sell those loans to another purchaser on favorable terms or at all, which may require us to reduce originations or hold additional loans on balance sheet and may reduce our flexibility in making financing decisions. In addition, the loss of one or more significant purchasers of our loans could increase the volatility of the mark-to-market methodology we use to determine the fair value of the loans we hold on balance sheet. This may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, capital requirements, liquidity and cash flows.\nGalileo and Technisys depend on a small number of clients, the loss or disruptions in operations of any of which could have a material adverse effect on their businesses and financial results, and negatively impact our financial results and results of operations. \nGalileo and Technisys revenue from clients is highly concentrated. There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of net revenue is concentrated with a limited number of clients, including fluctuations in revenue, the loss of any one or more of those clients as a result of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings involving the client, the loss of the client to a competitor, harm to that client’s reputation or financial prospects or other reasons, including adverse general economic conditions affecting Galileo and Technisys clients many of which are fintechs and other financial services firms. Any reduction in the amount of revenues that we derive from these clients, without an offsetting increase in new sales to other clients, has had and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our clients could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our future operating results. In addition, disruptions in the operations of certain of Galileo’s key clients have had an adverse impact on Galileo, and any future disruptions in the operations of any key Galileo or Technisys clients could be material and have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to perform certain key functions, and their failure to perform those functions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on certain third-party computer systems or third-party service providers, including cloud technology providers such as AWS, internet service providers, payment services providers, market and third-party data providers, regulatory and compliance services providers, clearing systems, market makers, exchange systems, banking technology systems, co-location facilities, communications facilities and other facilities to run our platform, facilitate trades by our members and support or carry out certain functions. For example, to provide our checking and savings account, cash management account, credit cards and other products and services, we rely on third parties that we do not control, such as payment card networks, our acquiring and issuing processors, payment card issuers, various financial institution partners, systems like the ACH, and other partners. We rely on these third parties for a variety of services, including the transmission of transaction data, processing of chargebacks and refunds, settlement of funds, and the provision of information and other elements of our services. In addition, external content providers provide us with financial information, market news, charts, option and stock quotes, digital assets quotes, research reports and other fundamental data that we provide to our members. Any interruption in these third-party services, or deterioration in the quality of their service or performance, could be disruptive to our business. Furthermore, third parties may rely on artificial intelligence or machine learning for the services they provide us and, given that the regulatory framework relating to the use of machine learning and artificial services in the provision of financial services is still developing, the third \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nparties’ use of such technologies may impact their ability to carry out certain functions or impact the quality of their service or performance.\nBecause we are a bank holding company subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, and because SoFi Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC and the FDIC, and SoFi Bank and its affiliates are subject to regulations issued by the CFPB, our and SoFi Bank’s oversight of third-party service providers is also subject to regulatory oversight. In 2024, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC increased their focus on regulating banks’ relationships and oversight over third-party service providers. For example, these agencies published interagency guidance and a joint statement on banks’ vendor management practices and arrangements with third parties to deliver bank products and services in May 2024 and July 2024, respectively, and these and other regulatory authorities continued to scrutinize and take enforcement actions against banks and their business partners for insufficient third-party management programs in 2024. In addition, because Galileo provides technology services to SoFi Bank, we are subject to additional regulatory scrutiny under Regulation W which requires, among other things, that arrangements between a bank and its affiliates are on market terms. If a regulatory authority found our or SoFi Bank’s service provider oversight to be lacking, the regulatory authority could require that we or SoFi Bank implement corrective action, including limiting or terminating certain relationships with service providers, which could be costly and disruptive to our business.\nFurther, we may, from time to time, decide to modify or terminate relationships with third-party service providers and to perform certain functions and/or services internally. For example, we historically used a third party bank to issue the SoFi Money debit cards and sponsor access to debit networks for payment transactions, funding transactions and associated settlement of funds, and sponsor and support ACH, check and wire transactions along with associated funds settlement. However, after gaining direct access to debit networks, we directly perform certain services previously sponsored by the third party bank. Although we have performed these services satisfactorily to date, there is no guarantee we will be able to continue to do so. Additionally, the migration of any such functions and/or services may introduce additional risks and could cause disruption to our business.\nOur third-party service providers are susceptible to operational, technological and security vulnerabilities, including security incidents and breaches and outages, which may impact our business, and our ability to monitor our third-party service providers’ data security is limited. In addition, these third-party service providers may rely on subcontractors to provide services to us that face similar risks. \nFailures or security incidents or breaches by or of our third-party service providers or their subcontractors that result in an interruption in service, unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data or other similar occurrences could interrupt our business, have in the past and could in the future cause us to incur losses, result in decreased member or client satisfaction and increase member or client attrition, subject us to member or client complaints, significant fines, litigation, disputes, claims, regulatory investigations or other inquiries and harm our reputation. Through contractual provisions and third-party risk management processes, we take steps to require that our providers, and their subcontractors, protect our data and information, including personal data. However, due to the size and complexity of our technology platform and services, the amount of data that we store and the number of members, technology platform clients, employees and third-party service providers with access to personal data, we, our third-party service providers and their subcontractors are potentially vulnerable to a variety of intentional and inadvertent cybersecurity breaches and other security-related incidents and threats, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any contractual protections we may have from our third-party service providers may not be sufficient to adequately protect us against such consequences, and we may be unable to enforce any such contractual protections.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that our third-party service providers or their subcontractors will be able to continue to provide these services to meet our current needs in an efficient, cost-effective manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs in the future. Certain of our vendor agreements are terminable on short or no notice, and if current vendors were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. An interruption in or the cessation of service by our third-party service providers or their subcontractors, coupled with our possible inability to make alternative arrangements in a smooth, cost-effective and timely manner, could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain aspects of the services we provide also rely and depend upon the ability of third parties with whom we do not contract directly to perform specified tasks or execute certain functions. For example, our customers access trading venues like securities exchanges through third parties like clearing brokers. If a trading venue experiences a system error and/or a failure of controls, subsequent trades may be impacted, such as trading executed at anomalous pricing. Similarly, if a trading venue experiences an outage, our customer’s ability to place trades or our ability to effect transactions in securities on behalf of \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\ncustomers via our broker-dealer may be impacted. As a result of these impacts, we might experience customer complaints, loss of revenue or other financial loss, or we may have to respond to regulatory inquiries related to such outages.\nIf a service provider fails to either provide the services required or expected or meet applicable contractual or regulatory requirements such as service levels or compliance with applicable laws, the failure could negatively impact our business. Such a failure could also adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our networks and services and the quality of our brand, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, if there were deficiencies in the oversight and control of our third-party relationships, and if our regulators held us responsible for those deficiencies, it could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nThe conditional conversion feature of our convertible notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition.\nHolders of our convertible notes issued in October 2021 and due in 2026 and our convertible notes issued in March 2024 and due in 2029 (collectively, the “notes”) may be entitled to convert the notes during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we may settle converted principal through the payment of cash and/or shares of common stock, which could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity and could result in a decline in our stock price.\nThe Capped Call Transactions may affect the value of the notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions (the “Capped Call Counterparties”). The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilutive effect on our common stock upon any conversion of the notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Capped Call Transactions, the Capped Call Counterparties or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchased shares of our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the notes.\nIn addition, the Capped Call Counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and from time to time prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the notes, any repurchase of the notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the notes are retired by us, in each case if we exercise the relevant election to terminate the corresponding portion of the Capped Call Transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock or the notes will depend, in part, on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Capped Call Transactions, and the Capped Call Transactions may not operate as planned.\nThe Capped Call Counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the Capped Call Transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Capped Call Counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have, from time to time, resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If a Capped Call Counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that Capped Call Counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated with increases in the market price or the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a Capped Call Counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any Capped Call Counterparty.\nIn addition, the Capped Call Transactions are complex, and they may not operate as planned. For example, the terms of the Capped Call Transactions may be subject to adjustment, modification or, in some cases, renegotiation if certain corporate or other transactions occur. Accordingly, these transactions may not operate as we intend if we are required to adjust their terms as a result of transactions in the future or upon unanticipated developments that may adversely affect the functioning of the Capped Call Transactions.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nMarket and Interest Rate RisksOur business and results of operations have in the past and may in the future be adversely affected by the financial markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic conditions generally.\nOur business, results of operations and reputation are directly affected by elements beyond our control, including general economic, political, social and health conditions in the U.S. and in countries abroad. These elements can arise suddenly and the full impact can remain unknown or result in adverse effects, including, but not limited to, extreme volatility in credit, equity and foreign currency markets, changes to buying patterns of our members and prospective members or reductions in the credit quality of our members, and changes to the financial condition of our technology platform clients and prospective clients. \nIn particular, markets in the U.S. or abroad have been and may in the future be affected by the level and volatility of interest rates, availability and market conditions of financing, recessionary pressures, inflation and hyperinflation, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer spending, employment levels, labor shortages, changes to fiscal policy, including expansion of U.S. federal deficit spending and resultant debt issuance, federal government shutdowns, developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling, changes in legislation, regulations or policy, energy prices, home prices, commercial property values, bankruptcies, a default by a significant market participant or class of counterparties, market volatility, liquidity of the global financial markets, the growth of global trade and commerce, exchange rates, trade policies, the availability and cost of capital and credit, disruption of communication, transportation or energy infrastructure and investor sentiment and confidence. Additionally, global markets have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of climate change, extreme weather events or natural disasters, the emergence or continuation of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks or campaigns, military conflict (e.g., the escalating conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing war in Ukraine), terrorism or other geopolitical events, including the upcoming changes to the United States presidential administration, which may affect our results of operations. For example, although we do not have operations in the locations impacted by these conflicts, the ongoing war in these locations has led and could in the future lead to macroeconomic effects, including volatility in commodity prices and the supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, as well as an increase in cyberattacks and espionage. Also, any sudden or prolonged market downturn in the U.S. or abroad, as a result of the above factors or otherwise, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including capital and liquidity levels. We are not able to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact that any of these events, as well as any other future events, may have on our business.\nSignificant downturns in the securities markets or in general economic and political conditions have in the past and may in the future also decrease the demand for our products and services and could in the future result in our members reducing their engagement with our platform. In addition, such significant downturns may cause default rates on our loans to increase and cause funding and liquidity concerns for our current and prospective technology platform clients reducing their adoption and use of our platform as a service products and services. Conversely, significant upturns in the securities markets or in general economic and political conditions may cause individuals to be less proactive in seeking ways to improve the returns on their trading or investment decisions and, thus, decrease the demand for our products and services. Any of these changes could cause our future performance to be uncertain or unpredictable, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a prolonged weakness in the U.S. equity markets or a general extended economic downturn could cause our members or technology platform clients to incur losses, which in turn could cause our brand and reputation to suffer. If our reputation is harmed, the willingness of our existing members or technology platform clients and potential new members or clients to do business with us could be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is sensitive to interest rates and interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including global, domestic and local economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates throughout 2022 and 2023 before lowering interest rates in 2024, and we are unable to predict whether interest rates will increase or decrease in the future. Further changes to prevailing interest rates could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes have in the past and could in the future also affect (i) our ability to originate loans at competitive rates and obtain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities; (iii) the average duration of our loan portfolios and other interest-earning assets; (iv) the mix of lending products we originate which is influenced by demand for refinancing products; and (v) the competition faced by our SoFi Money deposit product from other investment products which may become more attractive as interest rates rise. See “Changing expectations for inflation and fluctuations in interest rates could decrease demand for our lending products and negatively affect loan performance, as well as increase certain operating costs, such as employee compensation” for additional information on the risks of interest rate fluctuations to our business.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nInterest rate changes and other actions, including balance sheet management, lending facilities, and the Federal Reserve’s exit from quantitative easing, and similar actions taken by the Federal Reserve or other central banks, are beyond our control and difficult to predict. These actions affect interest rates and the value of financial instruments, increase the likelihood of a more volatile market, a further appreciating U.S. dollar and negative growth in gross domestic product, and affect other assets and liabilities and can impact our members and technology platform clients. Any economic downturn, especially in the regions in which we operate, may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels, loan demand and results of operations. \nChanges or uncertainty with respect to existing laws, regulations and policies, including changes in guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities, and evolving priorities, including those related to financial regulation, taxation, international trade, fiscal policy, cybersecurity and privacy, digital assets, climate change (including any required reduction of greenhouse gas emissions) and healthcare, may adversely impact U.S. or global economic activity and our members, our technology platform clients, our counterparties and our earnings and operations. For example, changes, or proposed changes, to certain U.S. trade and international investment policies, particularly with important trading partners (including China and the European Union (the “EU”)) have in recent years negatively impacted financial markets. Actions taken by other countries, particularly China, to restrict the activities of businesses, could also negatively affect financial markets. An escalation of tensions, such as a trade war between certain countries or a further escalation in conflict in the Middle East, could lead to further measures that adversely affect financial markets, disrupt world trade and commerce and lead to trade retaliation, including through the use of duties and tariffs, foreign exchange measures or the large-scale sale of U.S. Treasury Bonds. \nAny of these developments could adversely affect our business, our members, our technology platform clients, the value of our loan portfolios, our level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, our capital levels, our liquidity and our results of operations.\nWe have the option of pursuing a gain-on-sale origination model and, consequently, our business is affected by the cost and availability of funding in the capital markets. \nIn addition to the issuance of equity, historically we have funded our operations and capital expenditures through sales of our loans, secured and unsecured borrowing facilities and securitizations. We have the option of pursuing a gain-on-sale origination model and, consequently, our earnings and financial condition are largely dependent on the price we can obtain for our products in the capital markets, which has been and may be negatively impacted by interest rates that are higher than those in the recent past combined with longer periods during which we have held, and may continue to hold, loans on-balance sheet. These capital markets risks may be partially mitigated by the availability of bank deposits and other corporate cash (if any) to temporarily hold the loans on our balance sheet, and by utilizing our Loan Platform Business to originate and sell loans, in certain instances on a fixed fee basis. However, bank deposits and corporate cash have not historically been our primary source of funding and can be impacted by a number of factors, and our Loan Platform Business is new and does not have a significant performance history. Our ability to obtain financing in the capital markets depends, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, lending activities, public perceptions of the financial services industry, and condition of, and our access to, the capital markets at the time we seek financing. The capital markets have from time-to-time experienced periods of significant volatility, including, most recently, volatility driven by benchmark interest rate movements, uncertainty in the financial services sector, and the ongoing war in Ukraine, among other things. This volatility can dramatically and adversely affect financing costs when compared to historical norms or make funding unavailable. Additional factors that could make financing more expensive or unavailable to us include, but are not limited to, financial losses, events that have an adverse impact on our reputation, lawsuits challenging our business practices, adverse regulatory changes, changes in the activities of our business partners, loan performance, events that have an adverse impact on the financial services industry generally, counterparty availability, negative credit rating actions with respect to our rated securities, corporate and regulatory actions, interest rate changes, general economic conditions, including changing expectations for inflation, and the legal, regulatory and tax environments governing funding transactions, including existing or future securitization transactions. If financing is difficult, expensive or unavailable, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. \nChanging expectations for inflation and fluctuations in interest rates could decrease demand for our lending products and negatively affect loan performance, as well as increase certain operating costs, such as employee compensation.\nThe U.S. economy has remained strong despite facing certain headwinds, including, but not limited to, changing U.S. consumer spending patterns, fluctuating inflation and interest rates, reduced consumer discretionary spending, and weakening wage growth, but there is no guarantee that future changes will not have an impact. For example, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates throughout 2022 and 2023 before lowering interest rates in 2024. We are unable to predict whether interest rates will increase or decrease in the future. Continued elevated interest rates may decrease borrower demand for certain of our lending products, even as inflation places pressure on consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits as consumers evaluate \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\ntheir prospects for future income growth and employment opportunities in the current economic environment, and as borrowers face uncertainty about the impact of elevated prices on their ability to repay a loan. A change in demand for our lending products and any steps we may take to mitigate such change could impact our credit quality and overall growth. For example, we have experienced lower demand for our home loans in an elevated interest rate environment, as our historical demand has primarily resulted from refinancing, which is less attractive in a higher interest rate environment. We have also focused on personal loan originations to offset the lower demand in other lending products. Personal loans are a higher risk product than home loans or student loans and we have seen an increase in the amount of personal loans that we originate which may increase the inherent risk in our overall portfolio. In addition, fluctuating interest rates may increase our cost of capital and ability to offer a competitive interest rate on our loans. Although we closely monitor these increased risks, there is no guarantee we will make the correct adjustments to our originations or make adjustments quickly enough. Furthermore, economic pressure resulting in the inability of a borrower to repay a loan could translate into increased loan defaults, foreclosures and charge-offs and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.\nAdditionally, an inflationary environment combined with a healthy labor market and decreases in the market value of our equity awards could make it more costly for us to attract or retain employees. In order to meet the compensation expectations of our prospective and current employees due to inflationary and other factors, we have in the past and may in the future be required to increase our operating costs or risk losing skilled workers to competitors. See “Personnel and Business Continuity Risks—The job market and the optimization of our workforce creates a challenge and potential risk as we strive to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce” for more information on the risks posed by a competitive labor market.\nFluctuations in interest rates could negatively affect the demand for our checking and savings product. \nFalling, low or fluctuating interest rates, including declining interest rates in 2024, have in the past had and may in the future have a negative impact on the demand for our checking and savings product. Checking and savings provides members a digital banking experience that offers a variable annual percentage yield, which is at our discretion. If we are not able to offer competitive interest rates on deposit accounts, demand for our checking and savings product may decrease, which may impact our ability to access deposits as a more cost-effective source of funding for our loans. Although we have been in an elevated interest rate environment in recent years, interest rates began to decline in 2024 and there is no guarantee that the interest rate we offer on our deposit accounts will remain competitive and in a falling or low interest rate environment, account holders and prospective account holders may be discouraged from using these products, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.\nHigher than expected payment speeds of loans could negatively impact the fair market value of the lending portfolio and our returns as the holder of the residual interests in securitization trusts holding personal and student loans. These factors could materially alter our net revenue or the value of our residual interest holdings.\nThe rate at which borrowers prepay their loans can have a material impact on our net revenue, the value of our lending portfolio and the value of our residual interests in securitization trusts. Prepayment rates are subject to a variety of economic, social, competitive and other factors, including fluctuations in interest rates, availability of alternative financings, legislative, regulatory or policy changes affecting the student loan market, the home loan market, consumer lending generally and the general economy, including changing expectations for inflation. For example, interest rates began to decline in 2024, and a lower interest rate environment may lead to higher prepayment rates on loans.\nWhile we anticipate some variability in prepayment rates, extraordinary or extended increases or decreases in prepayment rates could materially affect our liquidity and net revenue. For example, when, as a result of unanticipated prepayment levels, loans within a securitization trust amortize faster than originally contracted due to prepayments, the trust’s pool balance may decline at a rate faster than the prepayment rate assumed when the trust’s bonds were originally issued. If the trust’s pool balance declines faster than originally anticipated, in most of our securitization structures, the bonds issued by that trust will also be repaid faster than originally anticipated. In such cases, our net revenue may decrease, inclusive of our servicing revenue and the diminished value of any retained residual interest by us in the trust. \nFinally, in instances of significant slowdowns in payment rates, rating agencies may place bonds on watch or change their ratings on (or their ratings methodology for) the bonds issued by a securitization trust, possibly raising or lowering their ratings, based upon these prepayment rates and their perception of the risk posed by those rates to the timing of the trust cash flows. Placing bonds on watch, changing ratings negatively, proposing or making changes to ratings methodology could: (i) affect our liquidity, (ii) impede our access to the securitization markets, (iii) require changes to our securitization structures, and (iv) raise or lower the value of the residual interests of our future securitization transactions. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nWe are exposed to financial risks that may be partially mitigated but cannot be eliminated by our hedging activities, which carry their own risks. \nWe continue to use, and may in the future use, financial instruments for hedging and risk management purposes in order to protect against possible fluctuations in interest rates, or for other reasons that we deem appropriate. In particular, we expect our interest rate risk to increase with our home loans business which continues to grow, including as a result of our acquisition of Wyndham. However, any current and future hedges we enter into will not completely eliminate the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates and our hedging activities may prove to be ineffective. \nThe success of our hedging strategy will be subject to our ability to correctly assess counterparty risk and the degree of correlation between the performance of the instruments used in the hedging strategy and any changes in interest rates, along with our ability to continuously recalculate, readjust and execute hedges in an efficient and timely manner. Therefore, though we may enter into transactions to seek to reduce risks, unanticipated changes may create a more negative consequence than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the instruments being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the effect of the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. Any failure to manage our hedging positions properly or inability to enter into hedging instruments under acceptable terms, or any other unintended or unanticipated economic consequences of our hedging activities, could affect our financial condition and results of operations. \nOur financial condition and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely impacted by an epidemic or pandemic. \nOccurrences of epidemics or pandemics, depending on their scale, may cause different degrees of disruption to the regional, state and local economies in which we offer our products and services. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in consumer and student behavior, as well as economic disruptions. Any future pandemic or public health crisis may result in, among other impacts, worker shortages, supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, and the reinstatement and subsequent lifting of restrictions and health and safety related measures. Any future epidemics or pandemics or other public health crises could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition, as well as the business, operations and financial conditions of our members, other customers and partners.\nSee “Our business and results of operations have in the past and may in the future be adversely affected by the financial markets, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies, and economic conditions generally” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Business Metrics” and “—Consolidated Results of Operations” for further discussion of the impact of macroeconomic conditions in recent periods on our business and operating results. \nStrategic and New Product RisksWe have in the past consummated, and from time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate, acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results. \nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our business. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary assets, businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. For example: (i) in April 2020, we acquired 8 Limited, an investment business in Hong Kong, (ii) in May 2020, we acquired Galileo, a company that provides technology platform services to financial and non-financial institutions, (iii) in February 2022, we acquired Golden Pacific, a bank holding company, (iv) in March 2022, we acquired Technisys, a cloud-native digital multi-product core banking platform, and (v) in April 2023, we acquired Wyndham, a mortgage lender. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include, among others: \n•diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n•coordination of technology, product development, risk management and sales and marketing functions;\n•retention of employees from the acquired company and retention of our employees due to cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization; \n•integration of the acquired company’s accounting, management information, human resources, third-party risk management and other administrative systems; \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n•the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, information security and cybersecurity safeguards, procedures and policies, including third-party risk management practices; \n•write-offs or impairments of intangible assets, goodwill or other assets recognized in connection with the acquisition; \n•liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, including employment laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; \n•litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated or current employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties; and \n•known and unknown regulatory compliance risks resulting from geographic expansion, including elevated risk factors for tax compliance, money laundering controls, and supervisory controls oversight.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business, generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, regulatory obligations to further capitalize our business, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, and increased regulatory scrutiny, any of which could harm our financial condition and negatively impact our stockholders. To the extent we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash, it would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other purposes. \nDemand for our products may decline if we do not continue to innovate or respond to evolving technological or other changes. \nWe operate in a dynamic industry characterized by rapidly evolving technology, frequent product introductions, and competition based on pricing and other differentiators. We continue to explore new product offerings and may rely on our proprietary technology to make our platform available to members, to service member accounts, to provide our technology platform as a service to clients and to introduce new products, which both fosters innovation and introduces new potential liabilities and risks. In addition, we may increasingly rely on technological innovation as we introduce new types of products, expand our current products into new markets, and continue to streamline our platform. For example, while we do not currently rely heavily on artificial intelligence, we expect to integrate more artificial intelligence into our technology in the future especially to improve the experience of our members. Even if we enhance our current products or release new products that incorporate artificial intelligence, there can be no assurance that our products will be successful or that we will innovate effectively to keep pace with the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence. Our ability to integrate artificial intelligence or other new technologies may also be limited by new laws or regulatory guidance. The process of developing new technologies and products is complex, and if we are unable to successfully innovate and continue to deliver a superior member and technology platform client experience, members’ and clients’ demand for our products may decrease and our growth and operations may be harmed. \nAn increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal, regulatory and financial exposure (including fines and other penalties), and could reduce the use and acceptance of SoFi Money and SoFi Credit Card. \nFinancial institutions like us, as well as our members, colleagues, regulators, vendors and other third parties, have experienced a significant increase in fraudulent activity in recent years and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated fraudsters and fraud rings in the future. This is particularly true for our newer products where we have limited experience evaluating customer behavior and performing tailored risk assessments, such as checking and savings and credit card. \nWe develop and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing fraudulent activity, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security and anti-fraud measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to fraudulent activity, which may affect our results of operations. For example, our general and administrative expenses in the past have included charges related to fraud events. The possibility of fraudulent or other malicious activities and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed, including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments, particularly as a large part of our workforce works remotely. Risks associated with each of these include theft of funds and other monetary loss, the effects of which could be compounded if not detected quickly. Fraudulent \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nactivity may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered. \nFraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failures to maintain a product’s integrity and/or security has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigations and intervention (such as mandatory card reissuance), increased litigation (including class action litigation), remediation, fines and response costs, negative assessments of us and our subsidiaries by regulators and rating agencies, reputational and financial damage to our brand, and reduced usage of our products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, we offer certain fraud and compliance and risk management services to technology platform clients as part of our platform as a service offerings and regulatory scrutiny of these types of services has increased recently. Any failure in these services provided to technology platform clients could result in regulatory actions or fines, and potential loss of client accounts.\nSuccessful fraudulent activity and other incidents related to the actual or perceived failures to maintain the integrity of our processes and controls could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or harming the reputation of the financial system in general, which could result in reduced use of our products and services. Such events could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements. Although we maintain insurance, there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we may incur will be covered under such policies or that the amount of insurance will be adequate. \nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of acquiring Technisys.\nWe closed the Technisys acquisition in March 2022 and its operations have been largely integrated into our business. The success of the Technisys acquisition, including anticipated benefits and cost savings and potential additional revenue opportunities, will depend, in part, on our ability to realize various benefits, including, among other things, the development of an end-to-end vertically integrated banking technology stack to support multiple products and enable the combined company to meet the expanding needs of existing customers and serve additional established banks, fintechs and non-financial brands looking to enter financial services. The inability to realize our expected cost savings in connection with the Technisys’ acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, lost cost savings and incremental revenue opportunities and diversion of management’s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe may continue to expand operations abroad where we have limited operating experience and may be subject to increased business, economic and regulatory risks that could adversely impact our financial results. \nIn April 2020, we undertook our first international expansion by acquiring 8 Limited, an investment business in Hong Kong. Additionally, with the acquisition of Galileo in May 2020, we gained clients in Canada, Mexico and Colombia and, with the acquisition of Technisys in March 2022, we further expanded our operations into Latin America. We may, in the future, continue to pursue further international expansion of our business operations, either organically or through acquisitions, in new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling and deploying our products and services. If we fail to deploy or manage our operations in these countries successfully, our business and operations may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: \n•political, social and/or economic instability or military conflict; \n•risks related to governmental regulations in foreign jurisdictions, including regulations relating to privacy, and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and enforcement; \n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and global market volatility; \n•higher levels of credit risk and fraud; \n•enhanced difficulties of integrating foreign acquisitions; \n•burdens of enforcing and complying with a variety of foreign laws; \n•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n•difficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations and subsidiaries; \n•different regulations and practices with respect to employee/employer relationships, existence of workers’ councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain international jurisdictions; \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n•compliance with statutory equity requirements; and \n•management of tax consequences.\nIf we are unable to manage the complexity of global operations successfully, our financial performance and operating results could suffer.\nCredit Market Related RisksWe operate in a cyclical industry. In an economic downturn, member default rates may increase, there may be decreased demand for our products, and there may be adverse impacts to our business.\nRecent macroeconomic factors, such as elevated interest rates, global events and market volatility and general uncertainty, may cause the economy to enter into a period of slower economic growth or a recession, the length and severity of which cannot be predicted. Such uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions can have a significant negative impact on our ability to generate adequate revenue and to absorb expected and unexpected losses. Many factors, including factors that are beyond our control, may result in higher default rates by our members and non-payment by our technology platform clients, a decline in the demand for our products, and potentially impact our ability to make accurate credit assessments, lending decisions or technology platform client selections. Any of these factors could have a detrimental impact on our financial performance and liquidity.\nOur Lending and Financial Services segments may be particularly negatively impacted by worsening economic conditions that place financial stress on our members resulting in loan defaults or charge-offs. If a loan charges off while we are still the owner, the loan either enters a collections process or is sold to a third-party collection agency and, in either case, we will receive less than the full outstanding interest on, and principal balance of, the loan. Declining economic conditions may also lead to either decreased demand for our loans or demand for a higher yield on our loans, and consequently lower prices or a lower advance rate, from institutional whole loan purchasers, securitization investors and warehouse lenders on whom we rely for liquidity.\nThe longevity and severity of a downturn or recession would also place pressure on lenders under our debt warehouses, whole loan purchasers and investors in our securitizations, each of whom may have less available liquidity to invest in our loans, and long-term market disruptions could negatively impact the securitization market as a whole. Although certain of our debt warehouses contain committed terms, there can be no assurance that our financing arrangements will remain available to us through any particular business cycle or be renewed on the same terms. The timing and extent of a downturn may also require us to change, postpone or cancel our strategic initiatives or growth plans to pursue shorter-term sustainability. The longer and more severe an economic downturn, the greater the potential adverse impact on us. \nOur Technology Platform segment is also susceptible to worsening economic conditions that place financial stress on our current clients using our platform as a service products and services and potential new clients interested in such services. These clients and potential clients may experience liquidity and other financial issues or strategically slowdown growth, any of which could lead them to decrease or terminate their use of our technology platform services or delay or reject implementation of new or expanded products and services. Any such actions with respect to our technology platform products and services could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThere can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable for our business, that interest in purchasing our loans by financial institutions or investment by clients in our platform as a service products and services will remain at current levels, or that default rates by our members or instances of non-payment by our technology platform clients will not increase. Reduced demand, lower prices or a lower advance rate for our loan products from institutional whole loan purchasers, securitization investors and warehouse lenders, increased default rates by our members, and reduced demand, lower prices and increased non-payment by our technology platform clients, may limit our access to capital, including debt warehouse facilities, securitizations and secured and unsecured borrowing facilities, and negatively impact our profitability. These impacts, in addition to limiting our access to capital and negatively impacting our profitability, could also in turn increase the volatility of the mark-to-market methodology we use to determine the fair value of the loans and credit card receivables we hold on balance sheet and consequently have a material adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations, capital requirements, liquidity and cash flows.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIf we do not make accurate credit and pricing decisions or effectively forecast our loss rates, our business and financial results will be harmed, and the harm could be material. \nIn deciding whether to extend credit to prospective or existing members, we rely upon data to assess our ability to extend credit within our risk appetite, our debt servicing capacity, and overall risk level to determine lending exposure and loan pricing. If the decision components, rapidly deteriorating macroeconomic conditions or analytics are either unstable, biased, or missing key pieces of information, the wrong decisions will be made, which will negatively affect our financial results. If our credit decisioning strategy fails to adequately predict the creditworthiness of our members, including a failure to predict a member’s true credit risk profile and ability to repay their loan or credit card balance, higher than expected loss rates will impact the fair value of our loans and credit card receivables. Additionally, if any portion of the information pertaining to the prospective member is false, inaccurate or incomplete, and our systems did not detect such falsities, inaccuracies or incompleteness, or any or all of the other components of our credit decision process fails, we may experience higher than forecasted losses, including losses attributed to fraud. Furthermore, we rely on credit reporting agencies to obtain credit reports and other information we rely upon in making underwriting and pricing decisions. If one of these third parties experiences an outage, if we are unable to access the third-party data used in our decision strategy, if such data contains inaccuracies or our access to such data is limited, our ability to accurately evaluate potential members will be compromised, and we may be unable to effectively predict credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would negatively impact our results of operations, which could be material. \nAdditionally, if we make errors in the development, validation, or implementation of any of the underwriting models or tools that we use for the loans securing our debt warehouses or included in securitization transactions or whole loan sales, such loans may experience higher delinquencies and losses, which would negatively impact our debt warehouse financing terms and future securitization and whole loan sale transactions. \nIf the information provided to us by applicants is incorrect or fraudulent, we may misjudge an applicant’s qualification to receive a loan or use one of our products, and our results of operations may be harmed. \nOur lending and platform access decisions are based partly on information provided to us by applicants. To the extent that an applicant provides information to us in a manner that we are unable to verify, or the information provided by an applicant consists of data obtained under false pretenses by third parties, is a manufactured/synthetic identity, or is a stolen identity, our credit decisioning process may not accurately reflect the associated risk. In addition, data provided by third-party sources, including credit reporting agencies, is a significant component of our credit decisions and this data may contain inaccuracies. Inaccurate analysis of credit data that could result from false loan application information could harm our reputation, business and results of operations. Additionally, we rely on the accuracy of applicant information in approving applicants for our non-lending products, such as SoFi Money, SoFi Credit Card or SoFi Invest accounts. If the information provided to us by these applicants is incorrect or fraudulent and we are unable to detect the inaccuracies, it increases our regulatory and fraud risk and the risk of identity theft to our members, and could harm our reputation, business and results of operations. \nWe use identity and fraud prevention tools to analyze data provided by external databases or automated physical identity document proofing technologies to authenticate each applicant’s identity. These fraud prevention tools, scores, and data aggregators are reliant on sustained access to reliable data sources to facilitate robust verification which have reduced effectiveness with diminished data access. From time to time in the past, however, these checks have failed and there is a risk that these checks could fail in the future and fraud, which may be significant, may occur and go undetected. For example, in the past we have identified certain fraudulent activity related to our personal loan products. While the fraudulent activity was detected and the losses were recognized in our results of operations, there can be no assurance there will not be future instances of fraud, that we will be able to detect such fraudulent activity in a timely manner, or that such future fraudulent activity will not be material. We may not be able to recoup funds underlying loans made in connection with inaccurate statements, omissions of fact or fraud, in which case our revenue, results of operations and profitability will be harmed. Fraudulent activity or significant increases in fraudulent activity could also lead to regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact our results of operations, brand and reputation, and require us to take steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs. \nInternet-based loan origination processes may give rise to greater risks than paper-based processes. \nWe use internet-based loan processes to obtain application information and distribute certain legally required notices to applicants for, and borrowers of, loans and to obtain electronically signed loan documents in lieu of paper documents with ink signatures obtained in person. These processes may entail greater risks than paper-based loan origination processes, including regarding the sufficiency of notice for compliance with consumer protection laws, risks that borrowers may challenge the authenticity of loan documents, or the validity of the borrower’s electronic signature on loan documents, and risks that unauthorized changes are made to the electronic loan documents. If any of those factors were to cause our loans, or any of the \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nterms of our loans, to be unenforceable against the relevant borrowers, or impair our ability to service our loans (as master servicer or servicer), the value of our loan assets would decrease significantly to us and to our whole loan purchasers, securitization investors and warehouse lenders. In addition to increased default rates and losses on our loans, this could lead to the loss of whole loan purchasers and securitization investors and trigger terminations and amortizations under our debt warehouse facilities, each of which would materially adversely impact our business.\nStudent loans are subject to discharge in certain circumstances. \nPrivate education loans, including the refinanced student loans and other student loans made by us, are generally not dischargeable by a borrower in bankruptcy. However, a private education loan may be discharged if a debtor files an adversary claim and the bankruptcy court determines that not discharging the debt would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor’s dependents. In addition, changes in law, regulations or governmental policies could increase the number of student loans subject to discharge in certain circumstances which would adversely affect our business. For example, the Biden Administration gave judges more leeway to discharge student loans, resulting in more borrowers discharging their student loans in bankruptcy in 2023, compared to prior years. It is possible that a higher percentage of borrowers will obtain relief under bankruptcy or other debtor relief laws in the future than is reflected in our historical experience. A private education loan that is not a refinanced parent-student loan is also generally dischargeable as a result of the death or disability of the borrower. The discharge of a significant amount of our loans could adversely affect our business and results of operations. See “Regulatory, Tax and Other Legal Risks—Legislative and regulatory policies and related actions have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our student loan portfolios and our student loan origination volume”.\nWe offer personal loans, which have a limited performance history, and therefore we have only limited prepayment, loss and delinquency data with respect to such loans on which to base projections. \nThe performance of the personal loans we offer is significantly dependent on the ability of the credit decisioning, income validation, and scoring models we use to originate such loans, which include a variety of factors, to effectively evaluate an applicant’s credit profile and likelihood of default. Despite recession-readiness planning and stress forecasting, there is no assurance that our credit criteria can accurately predict loan performance under economic conditions such as a prolonged down-cycle or recessionary economic environment or the governmental response to periods of disruption, which may drive unexpected outcomes. If our criteria do not accurately reflect credit risk on the personal loans, greater than expected losses may result on these loans and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. \nIn addition, personal loans are dischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a borrower without the need for the borrower to file an adversary proceeding. The discharge of a significant amount of our personal loans could adversely affect our financial condition. Furthermore, other characteristics of personal loans may increase the risk of default or fraud and there are few restrictions on the uses that may be made of personal loans by borrowers, which may result in increased levels of credit consumption. We also originate a material portion of our personal loans through ACH deposits directly to the borrowers, which may result in a higher risk of fraud. The effect of these factors may be to reduce the amounts collected on our personal loans and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. \nWe service all of the personal loans we originate and credit cards we issue, as well as other loans, and have limited servicing experience, and we rely on third-party service providers to service the student loans and home loans we originate, and to perform various other functions in connection with the origination and servicing of certain loans. If we or a third-party service provider fails to properly perform these functions, our business and our ability to service our loans may be adversely affected.\nWe service all of the personal loans we originate as well as certain loans originated by third parties and, in all material respects, all of the credit cards we issue, and we have limited experience with such servicing. We may begin servicing the student loans that we originate at some time in the future. We rely on sub-servicers to service all of our student loans and our home loans that we deliver to GSEs and do not sell servicing-released, and to perform certain back-up servicing functions with respect to our personal loans. In addition, we rely on third-party service providers to perform various functions relating to our loan origination and servicing business, including fraud detection, marketing, operational functions, cloud infrastructure services, information technology, telecommunications and processing remotely created checks. While we oversee these service providers to ensure they service our loans in accordance with our agreements and regulatory requirements, we do not have control over the operations of any of the third-party service providers that we utilize. In the event that a third-party service provider for any reason fails to perform such functions, including through negligence, willful misconduct or fraud, our ability to process payments and perform other operational functions for which we currently rely on such third-party service providers will suffer and our business, cash flows and future prospects may be negatively impacted. Such third-party service provider failures could also result in, among other things, increased regulatory scrutiny of our third-party service provider oversight, costly \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\ninvestigations, required corrective action and remediation, regulatory enforcement actions, class action lawsuits, and harm to our reputation.\nAny failure on our part or on the part of third parties on whom we rely to perform functions related to our servicing activities to properly service our loans or the loans originated by third parties could result in us being removed as the servicer on the loans, including loans financed by our warehouse facilities or sold into our whole loan sales channel and securitization transactions. If we fail to monitor our student loan sub-servicer and ensure that such sub-servicer complies with its obligations under state laws that require student loan servicers to be licensed, we may face civil claims for damages under such state laws. Because we receive revenue from such servicing activities, any such removal as the servicer or master servicer, could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects, as would the cost of onboarding a new servicer. Furthermore, we have agreed in our servicing agreements to service loans in accordance with the standards set forth therein and may be obligated to repurchase loans or indemnify the buyer of any such loans if we fail to meet those standards. \nAdditionally, if one or more key third-party service providers were to cease to exist, to become a debtor in a bankruptcy or an insolvency proceeding or to seek relief under any debtor relief laws or to terminate its relationship with us, there could be delays in our ability to process payments and perform other operational functions for which we are currently relying on such third-party service provider, and we may not be able to promptly replace such third-party service provider with a different third-party service provider that has the ability to promptly provide the same services in the same manner and on the same economic terms. As a result of any such delay or inability to replace such key third-party service provider, our ability to process payments and perform other business functions could suffer and our business, cash flows and future prospects may be negatively impacted. \nWe perform and manage the loan origination process for all of the home loans that we originate. If we fail to properly perform these functions, our home loans business may be adversely affected.\nIn April 2023, we acquired Wyndham, a mortgage lender, expanding our home loans business. In connection with the acquisition of Wyndham, we adopted loan origination technology which facilitates performing many functions in connection with the origination of home loans, including processing, underwriting, pricing, vendor management, closing, and additional functions for loan origination that we previously outsourced to third-party providers, and we now directly manage loan underwriters and loan processors which are services previously managed by third-party providers. In the event that we fail for any reason to perform or manage such functions in accordance with all applicable requirements, including through human errors, technology errors, negligence, willful misconduct or fraud, our ability to originate home loans will suffer and our business, cash flows and future prospects may be negatively impacted, and we could incur penalties or liabilities including obligations to repurchase loans from investors to whom we sold the loans. Additionally, if we fail to perform such functions or properly manage our new resources, we may be unable to complete, or be delayed in the completion of, the origination of home loans in our pipeline and to originate new home loans, and we may not be able to onboard a replacement service provider that has the ability to promptly provide the same services in the same manner and on the same economic terms.\nPotential geographic concentration of our members may increase the risk of loss on the loans that we originate and negatively impact our business. \nAny concentration of our members in specific geographic areas may increase the risk of loss on our loans. Certain regions of the U.S. from time to time will experience weaker economic conditions and higher unemployment and, consequently, will experience higher rates of delinquency and loss than on similar loans in other regions of the country. Moreover, a further deterioration in economic conditions or a recession, outbreaks of disease, the continued increase in extreme weather conditions and other natural events (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, drought, wildfires, mudslides, earthquakes and other extreme conditions) and other factors could adversely affect the ability and willingness of borrowers in affected regions to meet their payment obligations under their loans and may consequently affect the delinquency and loss experience of such loans. In addition, we, as master servicer for all student loans and home loans and as servicer of our personal loans, have offered in the past, and may in the future offer, hardship forbearance or other relief programs in certain circumstances to affected borrowers. \nConversely, an improvement in economic conditions in one or more of the geographic areas in which we have members could result in higher prepayments of their payment obligations under their loans in such states. As a result, we and the whole loan purchasers who hold our loans or securitization investors or warehouse lenders who hold securities backed by our loans may receive principal payments earlier than anticipated, and fewer interest payments than anticipated, and face certain reinvestment risks, such as the inability to acquire loans on equally attractive terms as the prepaid loans. In addition, higher prepayments than anticipated may have a negative impact on our servicing revenue which could cause our operating results and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nFurther, the concentration of our loans in one or more geographic locations may have a disproportionate effect on us or investors in our loans or securities backed by our loans if governmental authorities in any of those areas take action against us as originator, master servicer or servicer of those loans or take action affecting our ability as master servicer or servicer to service those loans.\nFunding and Liquidity RisksIf we are unable to successfully manage our assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and our funding costs, including with respect to deposit-based funding, our ability to finance additional loans and introduce new products may be negatively impacted. \nWe fund our operations and capital expenditures primarily through SoFi Bank deposits, warehouse funding, common equity capital, convertible debt, a corporate revolving credit facility, securitizations, and other financings. Through SoFi Bank, we utilize deposits which generally has a lower borrowing cost of funds than warehouse financing, and we have the ability to access other funding sources, such as the FHLB and certain brokered deposit channels established by SoFi Bank. Because we rely on each of these outlets for liquidity, if we are unable to successfully manage our assets and liabilities and funding costs as described above, or if we experience a loss or reduction of these liquidity outlets, our business could be materially adversely impacted. For example, certain banks have faced operational difficulties in accessing the Federal Reserve discount window and there is no guarantee that we will not face the same or similar issues. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully access the securitization markets at any given time, and in the event of a sudden or unexpected shortage of funds in the banking and financial system, we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain necessary levels of funding without incurring high funding costs, a reduction in the term of funding instruments, an increase in the amount of equity we are required to hold or the liquidation of certain assets. Furthermore, there is a risk that there will be no market at all for our loans either from whole loan buyers or through investments in securities backed by our loans.\nWe may require capital in excess of amounts we currently anticipate, and depending on market conditions and other factors, we may not be able to maintain our capital or obtain additional capital for our current operations or anticipated future growth on reasonable terms or at all. As the volume of loans that we originate, and the increased suite of products that we make available to members, increases, we may be required to expand the size of our debt warehousing facilities or seek additional sources of capital. The availability of these financing sources depends on many factors, some of which are outside of our control. We may also experience the occurrence of events of default or breaches of financial performance or other covenants under our debt agreements, which could reduce or terminate our access to institutional funding. \nAs we think about managing our assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and our funding costs, our deposit growth may slow. If we are unable to satisfactorily manage our current sources of funding, including deposits, or, if needed, secure new or alternative methods of financing, our ability to finance additional loans and to develop and offer new products may be negatively impacted. If deposit growth slows, we may need to turn to higher cost of funds. The interest rates, advance rates and other costs of new, renewed or amended facilities may also be higher than those currently in effect. If we are unable to renew or otherwise replace these facilities or generally arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may be forced to curtail our origination of loans or reduce lending or other operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. \nIf one or more of our warehouse facilities, on which we are highly dependent, is terminated or otherwise becomes unavailable, we may be unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. \nWe require a significant amount of short-term funding capacity for loans we originate. Consistent with industry practice, our existing warehouse facilities generally require periodic renewal. If any of our committed warehouse facilities are terminated or are not renewed or our uncommitted facilities are not honored, we may be unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, and we might not be able to originate an acceptable or sustainable volume of loans, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, as our business continues to expand, including our home loan business, we may need additional warehouse funding capacity for the loans we originate. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to obtain additional warehouse funding capacity on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. \nIf we fail to meet or satisfy any of the financial or other covenants included in our warehouse facilities, we would be in default under one or more of these facilities and our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facilities to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests against loans pledged under such facilities and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings. Certain of these facilities also contain cross-default provisions. These restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other business activities, which could materially and adversely affect us. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with all financial and other covenants included in our warehouse facilities in the future.\nIn addition, our agreements with our warehouse lenders contain various concentration limits and triggers, including related to excess spread. High interest rates have in the past and may in the future place pressure on our net cost of funds for loans held at SoFi Lending Corp., which do not benefit from deposit funding through SoFi Bank, and increase the likelihood of reaching an excess spread limit. A breach of such limits or other similar terms of such agreements could result in an inability to place loans in the relevant warehouse facilities and require us to pursue other forms of financing. If we are unable to find replacement financing on favorable terms, or at all, our operations could be impacted materially.\nIncreases in member default rates on loans could make us and our loans less attractive to whole loan buyers, lenders under debt warehouse facilities and investors in securitizations, which may adversely affect our access to financing and our business. \nIncreases in member default rates, due to deteriorating economic conditions or other factors, could make us and our loans less attractive to our existing or prospective funding sources, including whole loan buyers, securitization investors and lenders under debt warehousing facilities. If our existing funding sources do not achieve their desired financial returns or if they suffer losses, they or prospective funding sources may increase the cost of providing future financing or refuse to provide future financing or purchase loans on terms acceptable to us or at all. \nOur securitizations are nonrecourse to the Company and are collateralized by the pool of our loans pledged to the relevant securitization issuer. If the loans securing our securitizations fail to perform as expected, rating agencies may place our bonds on watch or change their ratings on (or their ratings methodology for) the bonds issued by our securitization trusts. Our loans performance and any actions taken by the rating agencies could result in the lenders under our warehouse facilities, the whole loan purchasers who purchase our loans, the investors in our securitizations who purchase securities backed by our loans, or future lenders, whole loan purchasers or securitization investors in similar arrangements, increasing the cost of providing future financing or refusing to provide future financing or purchase loans on terms acceptable to us or at all. \nWhile this risk may be partially mitigated by our ability to hold loans on our balance sheet, in sufficient volume, high member default rates would negatively impact our financial condition. Consequently, if we were to be unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we may have to curtail or cease our origination of loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. \nWe make representations and warranties in connection with the transfer of loans to whole loan purchasers, government-sponsored enterprises, and our debt warehouse lenders and securitization trusts. If such representations and warranties are not correct, we could be required to repurchase loans or indemnify the purchaser, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to operate and fund our business. \nWe sell and finance the loans we originate to and with third parties, including, with respect to home loans, counterparties like GSEs, and we make certain representations and warranties to those third parties in connection with the transfer of loans described below. In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to liability under these representations and warranties made to purchasers of loans. Such representations and warranties typically include, among other things, that the loans were originated and serviced in compliance with the law and with our credit risk origination policy and servicing guidelines, and, in connection with transfers to GSEs, that the loans were originated in compliance with the guidelines of the relevant GSE, and that, to the best of our knowledge, each loan was originated by us without any fraud or misrepresentation on our part or on the part of the borrower or any other person. In addition, purchasers require loans to meet strict underwriting and loan term criteria in order to be eligible for purchase. If those representations and warranties are breached as to a given loan, or if a certain loan we sell does not meet the relevant eligibility criteria, we will be obligated to repurchase the loan, typically at a purchase price equal to the then-outstanding principal balance of such loan, plus accrued interest and any premium. We may also be required to indemnify the purchaser for losses resulting from the breach of representations and warranties. With regard to home loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration or the VA, and to the extent that any of our home loans do not comply with Federal Housing Administration or VA guidelines, we could also face claims under the False Claims Act. In connection with our whole loan sales, we also typically covenant to repurchase any loan that enters delinquent status within the first thirty to sixty days following origination of the loan. Any significant increase in our obligation to repurchase loans or indemnify purchasers of loans could have a significant adverse impact on our cash flows, even if they are reimbursable, and could also have a detrimental effect on our business and financial condition. If any such repurchase event occurs on a large scale, we may not have sufficient funds to meet our repurchase obligations, which would result in a default under the underlying agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to resell or refinance loans repurchased due to a breach of a representation or warranty or we may be forced to sell such loans below par. Any such event could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. In addition, in the acquisition of Wyndham, we also acquired \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nWyndham's liability to its loan investors and loan insurers for mortgage loans originated by Wyndham, including repurchase obligations that might not be contingent upon the investor proving an error by Wyndham.\nIn addition to loan level representations and warranties, our agreements with the lenders and investors on our securitizations, debt warehouse facilities and corporate revolving debt contain a number of corporate financial covenants and early payment triggers and performance covenants. These facilities, together with deposits, are the primary funding sources available to support the maintenance and growth of our business and our liquidity would be materially adversely affected by our inability to comply with the various covenants and other specified requirements set forth in our agreements with our lenders and investors, which could result in the early amortization, default and/or acceleration of our existing facilities. Such covenants and requirements include financial covenants, portfolio performance covenants and other events. For a description of these covenants, requirements and events, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources”. \nDuring an early amortization period or occurrence of a termination event or an event of default, principal collections from the loans in our warehouse facilities would be applied to repay principal under such facilities rather than being available to fund newly originated loans. During the occurrence of a termination event or an event of default under any of our facilities, the applicable lenders could accelerate the related debt and such lenders’ commitments to extend further credit under the related facility, if any, would terminate. If we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under such facilities and securitizations, the applicable lenders and noteholders could seek remedies, including against the collateral pledged under such facilities and by the securitization trust. An acceleration of the debt under certain facilities could also lead to a default under other facilities and, in certain instances, our hedging arrangements, due to cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions. \nAn early amortization event or event of default would negatively impact our liquidity, including our ability to originate new loans, and require us to rely on alternative funding sources, which might increase our funding costs or which might not be available when needed. If we were unable to arrange new or alternative methods of financing on favorable terms, we might have to hold loans on balance sheet in an amount that may negatively impact our financial condition, or curtail or cease the origination of loans, which could impair our growth, and, in each case, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations under our facilities. \nWe require substantial capital and, in the future, may require additional capital, to pursue our business objectives and achieve recurring profitability. If adequate capital is not available to us or is unavailable on favorable terms, including due to the cost and availability of funding in the capital markets, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. \nSince our founding, we have raised substantial equity and debt financing to support the growth of our business. We may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and growth strategy and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including supporting our lending operations, increasing our marketing expenditures to attract new members and technology platform clients and improve our brand awareness, developing our products, introducing new services, further expanding internationally in existing or new countries or further improving existing offerings and services, enhancing our operating infrastructure and potentially acquiring complementary businesses and technologies, and complying with the increased regulatory requirements for bank holding companies and banks. Accordingly, on a regular basis we need, or we may need, to engage in additional debt or equity financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, in amounts we need, or permitted to be applied to specific use cases, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Volatility in the credit markets in general or in the market for personal, student and home loans and credit cards in particular may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. Although our borrowing costs have trended lower following the acquisition of a national bank charter, the cost of our borrowing could increase due to market volatility, interest rates that are higher than those in the recent past, changes in the risk premiums required by lenders or the unavailability of traditional sources of debt capital. Volatility or depressed valuations or trading prices in the equity markets may similarly adversely affect our ability to obtain equity financing. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. \nWe are required to serve as a source of financial strength for SoFi Bank, which is subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by federal regulators, which means that we may be required to provide capital or liquidity support to SoFi Bank, even at times when we may not have the resources to provide such support. In addition, maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to our securities brokerage, including key functions such as transaction settlement, custody requirements and margin lending. Our broker-dealer subsidiary, SoFi Securities, is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act, which \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nspecifies minimum capital requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers, and SoFi Securities is subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act, which requires broker-dealers to maintain certain liquidity reserves. We meet our liquidity needs primarily from working capital, deposits and cash generated by member activity, as well as from external debt and equity financing. Increases in the number of members, fluctuations in member cash or deposit balances, as well as market conditions or changes in regulatory treatment of member deposits, may affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs. \nA reduction in our liquidity position could reduce our members’ confidence in us, which could result in the withdrawal of member assets, including deposits held at SoFi Bank, and loss of members, or could cause us to fail to satisfy minimum capital requirements for SoFi Bank, or broker-dealer or other regulatory capital guidelines, which may result in immediate suspension of banking and other securities activities, regulatory prohibitions against certain business practices, increased regulatory inquiries and reporting requirements, increased costs, fines, penalties or other sanctions, by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the SEC, FINRA or other SROs or state regulators, and could ultimately lead to the liquidation of SoFi Bank or our broker-dealer or other regulated entities. Factors which may adversely affect our liquidity position include temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances, fluctuations in cash held in member accounts, a significant increase in our margin lending activities, increased regulatory capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, or Federal Housing Administration or VA guidelines, other regulatory changes or a loss of market or member confidence resulting in unanticipated withdrawals of member assets. We expect that we will continue to use our available cash to fund our lending activities and help scale our Financial Services segment. To supplement our cash resources, we may seek to enter into additional securitizations and whole loan sale agreements or increase the size of existing debt warehousing facilities, increase the size of, or replace, our revolving credit facility, continue to grow deposits and pursue other potential options. In addition, a reduction in our liquidity position could impair our technology platform clients’ confidence in us and our platform as a service products and services, many of which require capital investments and ongoing platform maintenance by us, which could result in decisions by our technology platform clients to terminate or not renew their existing contracts or to not add new products to their account.\nIf we are unable to adequately maintain our cash resources, we may delay non-essential capital expenditures, implement cost cutting procedures, delay or reduce future hiring, discontinue the pursuit of our strategic objectives and growth strategies or reduce our rate of future originations compared to the current level. There can be no assurance that we can obtain sufficient sources of external capital to support the growth of our business. Delays in doing so or failure to do so may require us to reduce loan originations or reduce our operations, which would harm our ability to pursue our business objectives as well as harm our business, operating results and financial condition. \nWe are unable to finance all of the receivables that we originate or other assets that we hold, and that illiquidity could result in a negative impact on our financial condition.\nWe have the option of pursuing a gain-on-sale origination model, the success of which is tied to our ability to finance the assets that we originate. Certain of our assets, however, are ineligible for sale to a whole loan buyer or securitization trust, or are ineligible for, or are subject to a lower advance rate under, warehouse funding, each of which has specific eligibility criteria for receivables it purchases or holds as collateral. Ineligible receivables include, among others, those in default or that are delinquent, receivables with defects in their origination or servicing, including fraud, or receivables generated under origination guidelines and credit policies that are no longer in effect. In addition, many of our warehouse funding sources contain excess concentration limits for loans in forbearance or with specific loan level characteristics such as time-to-maturity or loan type. Once these limits have been exceeded, the advance rate applied to those receivables becomes less advantageous to us. If we are unable to sell or reasonably fund these receivables, we are required to hold them on our consolidated balance sheet which, in sufficient volume, negatively impacts our financial condition. \nIn addition to the receivables described above, we also hold on our consolidated balance sheet certain risk retention assets with respect to which we have a reduced ability to receive financing. These risk retention assets include residuals from our securitization trusts that are either ineligible for transfer or are subject to EU regulations. The illiquidity of these positions may negatively impact our financial condition. \nOur checking and savings product is expected to continue to provide us with an important source of cost-efficient funding and any failure to scale the product due to our limited experience or a competitive marketplace could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. \nWe expect that checking and savings, a deposit account product, will continue to provide us with an important source of deposits to use for cost-effective funding of loan originations and other activities. However, revenue growth for checking and savings is dependent on increasing the volume of members who open an account and on growing balances in those accounts. Although our checking and savings account product has grown since its introduction in the first quarter of 2022, there is no \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nguarantee that account openings and the amount on deposit in those accounts will continue to grow. In addition, although we have invested in a number of initiatives to attract new checking and savings account holders and capture a greater share of our members’ savings, including offering a competitive annual percentage yield on deposits and offering SoFi Plus membership benefits to deposit holders, there can be no assurance that these investments to acquire and retain members, provide differentiated features and services and spur usage of our deposit account product will be effective or cost effective. There are also no assurances that we will be able to maintain a competitive annual percentage yield on deposits, and members can easily transfer checking and savings account balances to our competitors. Further, developing our service offerings and marketing the checking and savings product in additional customer acquisition channels could have higher costs than anticipated or be less effective than anticipated, and could adversely impact our results or dilute our brand. Finally, our checking and savings product faces competition from similar products offered by our competitors which may offer more attractive features, including a higher interest rate on deposits, which may impact the success of the product. In the event we are unable to sufficiently grow the checking and savings product, we may be required to find alternative, higher-cost funding for our lending and other activities, or we might not be able to originate an acceptable or sustainable volume of loans, either of which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. See “Market and Interest Rate Risks — Fluctuations in interest rates could negatively affect the demand for our checking and savings product”.\nAny failure to accurately capture credit risk or to execute our funding strategy for SoFi Credit Card could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. \nIn October 2024, we expanded our credit card program by launching two new credit cards: SoFi Everyday Cash Rewards and SoFi Essential. The performance of these new credit cards and the existing SoFi Unlimited 2% Credit Card products is significantly dependent on the ability of the credit and fraud decisioning and scoring models we use to originate the product, which includes a variety of factors, to effectively prevent fraud, evaluate an applicant’s credit profile and likelihood of default. Despite establishing a defined risk appetite and leveraging third-party stress testing of product loss forecasts, there is no assurance that our credit criteria can accurately predict repayment and loss profiles. If our criteria do not accurately prevent fraud or reflect credit risk on the SoFi Credit Card products, greater than expected losses may result and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, revenue growth for the SoFi Credit Card program is dependent on increasing the volume of members who open an account and on growing loan balances on those accounts. Over time we will continue to invest in a number of new product initiatives to attract new SoFi Credit Card members and capture a greater share of our members’ total spending and borrowings. Revenue growth for SoFi Credit Card may be adversely affected by new restrictions on credit card fees finalized by the CFPB in March 2024. Although originally scheduled to become effective in May 2024, the rule was challenged in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals following a stay order from that court. In December 2024, a federal judge rejected the CFPB’s request to reinstate the credit card late fee cap, effectively ending the CFPB’s attempt to enforce the cap. With the change to the U.S. presidential administration in January 2025 and the possible reshaping of the CFPB under new leadership, the CFPB may not continue litigating in favor of the cap, or enforce the cap. If the CFPB’s rule were to become effective as written, it could, if we modify our terms in response to changes made by issuers impacted by the rule, adversely affect revenue. \nThe operation of our rewards program for the SoFi Unlimited 2% Credit Card and the SoFi Everyday Cash Rewards could have a negative impact on the revenue for our Credit Card program. In December 2024, the CFPB published a Consumer Financial Protection Circular, which warned that the CFPB is scrutinizing and taking actions against operators of credit card reward programs, and declared it may be unlawful to devalue earned rewards, use fine print to disclose conditions for earning or redeeming rewards, or change the benefits for which rewards may be earned and redeemed. This guidance could make it more expensive to operate the rewards program and limit our ability to adapt the program to changing economic conditions. \nWhile we have generally seen increases in revenue from SoFi Credit Card, there can be no assurance that our investments in SoFi Credit Card to acquire members, provide differentiated features and services and spur usage of our cards will continue to be effective, and developing our service offerings and forming new partnerships could have higher costs than anticipated, and could adversely impact our results or dilute our brand.\nFurthermore, the success of the SoFi Credit Card products depends on our ability to execute on our funding strategy for the resulting credit card receivables. We may establish a credit card receivable securitization program in the future. There is no guarantee, however, that we will be successful in establishing a securitization program for these assets. In the event we are unable to finance our credit card receivables, we may be required to hold those assets on our consolidated balance sheet or sell them for a loss, either of which could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nRegulatory, Tax and Other Legal RisksAs a bank holding company, we are subject to extensive supervision and regulation, and changes in laws and regulations applicable to bank holding companies could limit or restrict our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, and SoFi Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC and the FDIC, as well as regulations issued by the CFPB. Federal laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution, permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments, permissible nonbanking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. The OCC possesses the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation, and the Federal Reserve possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. In general, the bank supervisory framework is intended to protect insured depositors and the safety, soundness and stability of the U.S. financial system and not shareholders in depository institutions or their holding companies.\nIn connection with applying for approval to become a bank holding company, we developed a financial and bank capitalization plan and enhanced our governance, compliance, controls and management infrastructure and capabilities in order to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations, which required, and will continue to require, substantial time, monetary and human resource commitments. If any new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations to which we are subject impose requirements on us that are impractical or that we cannot satisfy, our financial performance, and our stock price, may be adversely affected.\nFederal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and define “capital” for calculating these ratios. The minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The regulations also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the capital conservation buffer amount. The federal banking regulators could also require the Company and/or SoFi Bank, as applicable, to hold capital that exceeds minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions. The application of these capital requirements could, among other things, require us to maintain higher capital resulting in lower returns on equity, and we may be required to obtain additional capital, or face regulatory actions if we are unable, to comply with such requirements.\nWe are also subject to the requirements in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve’s implementing Regulation W, which regulate loans, extensions of credit, purchases of assets, and certain other transactions between an insured depository institution (such as SoFi Bank) and its affiliates. The statute and regulation require us to impose certain quantitative limits, collateral requirements and other restrictions on “covered transactions” between SoFi Bank and its affiliates and require all transactions be on “market terms” and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices. For example, Galileo’s provision of technology services to SoFi Bank is subject to Regulation W, including the requirement that the arrangement is on market terms.\nThe laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change, including increased regulation as a result of the turmoil in the banking industry. These changes could adversely and materially impact us. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal banking laws subject companies with $10 billion or more of consolidated assets to additional regulatory requirements. Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is commonly known as the “Durbin Amendment”, amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to restrict the amount of interchange fees that may be charged and prohibit network exclusivity for debit card transactions. SoFi Bank is required to comply with the restrictions on interchange fees that went into effect on July 1, 2023, which may negatively impact future interchange fees we collect. In addition, in November 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed changes to the regulations implementing the Electronic Fund Transfer Act that would further restrict the amount of interchange fees that may be charged and require biennial reviews of those fees. Guidance from regulators of SoFi Bank can subject its non-bank affiliates to increased governance. For example, the OCC’s guidance on retail non-deposit investment products, or RNDIPs, applies to referral arrangements that SoFi Bank may have with an affiliate, including SoFi Securities. This guidance, which was further updated in June 2024 to align with the SEC’s Regulation BI, requires that banks implement and maintain effective oversight and monitoring of relevant RNDIP arrangements to ensure that, among other things, sales transactions and recommendations to retail investors comply with SEC regulations. Changes in laws, rules, regulations and supervisory guidance and policies could, among other things, subject us to \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nadditional costs, including costs of compliance; limit the types of financial services and products we may offer; and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies, or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal and state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, revocation of a banking charter or registration as a broker-dealer and investment adviser, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFinally, we intend to continue to explore other products for SoFi Bank over time. Some of those products may require, or be deemed to require, additional data, procedures, partnerships, regulatory approvals, or capabilities that we have not yet obtained or developed. Should we fail to expand and evolve SoFi Bank products in a successful manner, or should these new products, or new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations, impose requirements on us that are cumbersome or that we cannot satisfy, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe U.S. Congress, the Trump administration, or any new administration may make substantial changes to fiscal, tax, and other federal policies that may adversely affect our business.\nThe Trump administration has called for significant changes to U.S. trade, healthcare, immigration and government regulatory policy and has begun implementing policy changes at a rapid pace. Changes to U.S. policy implemented by the U.S. Congress, the Trump administration or any new administration have impacted among other things, the U.S. and global economy, international trade relations, unemployment, immigration, healthcare, taxation, the U.S. regulatory environment, inflation and other areas. Although we cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business, they could adversely affect our business. Until we know what policy changes are made, whether those policy changes are challenged and subsequently upheld by the court system and how those changes impact our business and the business of our competitors over the long term, we will not know if, overall, we will benefit from them or be negatively affected by them.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or commitments, or to satisfy our regulators’ supervisory expectations, could subject us to, among other things, supervisory or enforcement action, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations or commitments, including SoFi Bank’s operating agreement, if we are deemed to have engaged in unsafe or unsound conduct, or if we do not satisfy our regulators’ supervisory expectations, then we may be subject to increased scrutiny, supervisory criticism, governmental or private litigation and/or a wide range of potential monetary penalties or consequences, enforcement actions, criminal liability and/or reputational harm. Such actions could be public or of a confidential nature, and arise even if we are acting in good faith or operating under a reasonable interpretation of the law and could include, for example, monetary penalties, payment of damages or other monetary relief, restitution or disgorgement of profits, directives to take remedial action or to cease or modify practices, restrictions on growth or expansionary proposals, denial or refusal to accept applications, removal of officers or directors, prohibition on dividends or capital distributions, increases in capital or liquidity requirements and/or termination of SoFi Bank’s deposit insurance. Additionally, compliance with applicable laws, regulations and commitments requires significant investment of management attention and resources. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or commitments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn inability to accept or maintain deposits due to market demand or regulatory constraints could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business.\nSoFi Bank accepts deposits and uses the proceeds as a source of funding, with our direct retail deposits becoming a larger proportion of our funding over time. Although we launched the SoFi Insured Deposit Program in 2023, whereby funds (up to $2 million) are deposited into deposit accounts at banks which are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits, we continue to face strong competition with regard to deposits, and pricing and product changes may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain cost-effective deposit balances. To the extent we offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits, our funding costs will be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is also dependent on SoFi Bank’s capital levels. The FDIA’s brokered deposit provisions and related FDIC rules in certain circumstances prohibit banks from accepting or renewing brokered deposits and apply other restrictions, such as a cap on interest rates that can be paid. For example, while SoFi Bank met the definition of “well-capitalized” as of December 31, 2024 and currently has no restrictions regarding acceptance of brokered deposits or setting of interest rates, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet this definition. In July 2024, the FDIC proposed a rule which, if finalized as proposed, would expand the types of deposits that would be considered “brokered deposits” and we could be subject to these restrictions. Additionally, our regulators can adjust \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\napplicable capital requirements at any time and have authority to place limitations on our deposit businesses. An inability to attract or maintain deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our ability to fund our business.\nLegislative and regulatory policies and related actions have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our student loan portfolios and our student loan origination volume.\nLegislative and regulatory actions have had and could continue to have a significant impact on our student loan refinancing business. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. In compliance with the CARES Act, payments and interest accrual on all loans owned by the U.S. Department of Education were initially suspended through September 30, 2020, a pause on student loan repayments that was subsequently extended through August 30, 2023 by a series of executive actions. Interest on federal student loans began accruing on September 1, 2023 and borrowers’ first loan payments were due in October 2023. Although federal student loans are back in repayment, the increased focus in recent years by policymakers on outstanding federal student loans, including, among other things, on the total volume of outstanding loans and on the number of loans outstanding per borrower, has led to discussion of additional potential legislative and regulatory actions and other possible steps to, among other things:\n•permit private education loans such as our refinanced student loan and in-school student loan products to be discharged in bankruptcy without the need to show undue hardship; \n•amend the federal postsecondary education loan programs, including to reduce interest rates on certain loans, to revise repayment plans, to make income-driven repayment plans more attractive to borrowers, to implement broader loan forgiveness plans, to provide for refinancing of private education loans into federal student loans at low interest rates, to reduce or eliminate the Grad PLUS program (which authorizes loans that comprise a substantial portion of our student loan refinancing business) and to provide for refinancing of existing federally held student loans into new federal student loans at low interest rates; \n•require private education lenders to reform loan agreements to provide for income-driven repayment plans and other payment plans; and\n•make sweeping changes to the entire cost structure and financial aid system for higher education in the U.S., including proposals to provide free postsecondary education.\nIn addition, there is pressure on policymakers to reduce or cancel student loans or accrued interest at a significant scale, which would further reduce demand for our student loan refinancing product and have a negative impact on our loan origination volume and revenue. For example, despite legal challenges at the Supreme Court to some of the Biden Administration’s prior student loan forgiveness measures, the Biden Administration subsequently continued to pursue options for providing relief to student borrowers. However, in December 2024, the U.S. Department of Education withdrew proposed rules seeking to provide student loan debt forgiveness for borrowers experiencing financial hardship and terminated three Program Integrity and Institutional Quality issues, which would have would have allowed the U.S. Secretary of Education to cancel student loans for several groups of borrowers, including those who had been in repayment for decades and others experiencing financial hardship, and could have reduced or eliminated the education debts of millions of Americans. In addition, the change of administration in January 2025 has brought uncertainty to the future of student debt relief programs and the U.S. Department of Education.\nThe future impact to our student loan refinancing product will also largely depend on expectations regarding the introduction or implementation of these or any additional relief measures, the interest rate environment, how competitive our student loan refinancing products are compared to our competitors and macroeconomic factors. If in the future, student loans were forgiven or canceled in any meaningful scale, or if federal loan borrowers were permitted to refinance at lower interest rates, our student loan refinancing business within our Lending segment, which is our largest segment, would be materially and adversely affected and our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects could be materially and adversely affected as a result. In addition, proposals to make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy or similar proposals could make whole loan purchasers less likely to purchase our student loans, securitization investors less likely to purchase securities backed by our student loans or warehouse lenders less likely to lend against our student loans at attractive advance rates. As a result of any material adverse effect to our Lending segment, our overall profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects may be adversely affected.\nAlthough we continue to evaluate the ultimate impact of local, state and federal legislation, regulation and politics, guidance and actions, future legislative, regulatory and executive actions, and the ongoing impact of our own forbearance measures on our financial results, business operations and strategies, there is no guarantee that our estimates will be accurate or that any actions we take based on such estimates will be successful. Furthermore, we believe that the cost of responding to, and complying with, evolving laws and regulations, as well as any guidance from enforcement actions, will continue to increase, as \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nwill the risk of penalties and fines from any enforcement actions that may be imposed on our businesses. Our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or future business prospects could be materially and adversely affected as a result.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state consumer protection laws, rules, regulations and guidance, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe CFPB, an agency which oversees compliance with and enforces federal consumer financial protection laws, has supervisory authority over the offer, sale or provision of our consumer financial products and services. Prior to January 1, 2024, the OCC examined SoFi Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and enforced CFPB rules with respect to SoFi Bank. In addition, to the extent certain of our lending or loan servicing activity was conducted outside of SoFi Bank, the CFPB had the authority to pursue enforcement actions against us as a company offering those certain consumer financial products or services. Beginning January 1, 2024, SoFi Bank and its affiliates became subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of UDAAP in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB may seek a range of remedies, including rescission of contracts, refund of money, return of real property, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other compensation for unjust enrichment, damages, public notification of the violation and “conduct” restrictions (i.e., future limits on the target’s activities or functions). Under the Biden administration, the CFPB pursued a more aggressive enforcement policy with respect to a range of regulatory compliance matters. For example, on January 6, 2022, the CFPB announced a new initiative to scrutinize so-called consumer “junk fees.” Since then, the CFPB issued guidance to banks on how to avoid charging unlawful overdraft and depositor fees, confirmed their policy against “pay to pay” fees or charging any fees not expressly authorized and properly disclosed in a consumer agreement, issued a final rule limiting credit card penalty fees, which was stayed pending ongoing litigation, and launched an inquiry into junk fees in mortgage closing costs. The CFPB has also identified additional unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices that could violate the CFPA, including certain billing and collection practices after bankruptcy discharges of certain student loan debt, taking unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s reasonable reliance on an operator or lead generator to act in the consumer’s interests, and including unclear or unenforceable terms and conditions in consumer contracts or fine print. The CFPB has also focused on student borrower harms from servicing failures, program disruptions, college banking and credit card agreements, and a variety of illegal practices and has been active in litigation against student loan servicers and others, including Climb Credit and its largest shareholder 1/0, Ejudicate, Navient, Prehired, the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts and Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, Western Benefits Group, Student Loan Pro and its owner, Judith Noh, and Performant Recovery, Inc. for CFPA and other violations. Increased enforcement or rules from the CFPB could increase our legal and financial compliance costs, require us to evaluate or amend certain activities or products in light of evolving compliance standards, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. In addition, the change of administration in January 2025 has brought uncertainty as to the future of the CFPB and the aggressiveness of its enforcement policies.\nWe hold lending licenses or similar authorizations in multiple states, each of which has the authority to supervise and examine our activities. As a licensed consumer lender, mortgage lender, loan broker, collection agency, Money Services Business (“MSB”) and loan servicer in certain states, we are subject to examinations by state agencies in those states. Similarly, we are subject to licensure requirements and regulations as an education loan servicer in multiple states. An administrative proceeding, litigation, investigation or regulatory proceeding relating to allegations or findings of the violation of such laws by us, any sub-servicer we engage, or our collection agents, could impair our ability to service and collect on our loans or could result in requirements that we pay damages, fines or penalties and/or cancel the balance or other amounts owing under one or more of our loans. There is no assurance that allegations of violations of the provisions of applicable federal or state consumer protection laws will not be asserted against us, any sub-servicers or collection agents we engage or other prior owners of our loans in the future. To the extent it is determined that any of our loans were not originated in accordance with all applicable laws, we may be obligated to repurchase such loan from a whole loan buyer, securitization trust or warehouse facility. \nWe must comply with federal, state and local consumer protection laws including, among others, the federal and state UDAAP laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the CRA, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the ECOA, the FHA, the HMDA, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act, FCRA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Military Lending Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the GLBA, the CARES Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. We must also comply with laws on advertising, as well as privacy laws, including the TCPA, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, applicable laws and regulations of Hong Kong including the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance and the Personal Data (Privacy) (Amendment) Ordinance 2012 and the CCPA and other state privacy laws. Privacy and data security concerns, data collection and transfer restrictions, contractual obligations and U.S. laws and regulations related to data privacy, security and protection could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with applicable laws is costly, and our failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws could lead to:\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n•loss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our lending and servicing businesses; \n•damage to our reputation in the industry;\n•governmental investigations and enforcement actions; \n•administrative fines and penalties and litigation;\n•civil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits; \n•inability to enforce loan agreements; \n•diminished ability to sell loans that we originate or purchase, requirements to sell such loans at a discount compared to other loans or repurchase or address indemnification claims from purchasers of such loans; \n•loss or restriction of warehouse facilities to fund loans; \n•inability to raise capital; and\n•inability to execute on our business strategy, including our growth plans. \nThe CRA, to which SoFi Bank is subject, presents a useful example of how a failure to comply with applicable laws could hamper our growth. On January 1, 2023, SoFi Bank began operating under a five-year CRA strategic plan which includes measurable goals relating to: (i) CD Lending and CD Investments, (ii) CD Contributions, (iii) CD Services, (iv) Small Business Lending, and (v) Retail Services and Products. On October 23, 2023, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC approved changes to their CRA regulations, maintaining the existing CRA ratings (Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, and Substantial Noncompliance) but modifying the evaluation framework to replace the existing tests generally applicable to banks with at least $2 billion in assets (the lending, investment, and services tests) with four new tests and associated performance metrics. The new CRA regulations, which become effective on January 1, 2026, increase the geographic areas in which banks will be evaluated for CRA performance and may be particularly burdensome on banks focused on mobile and digital banking such as SoFi Bank. The implementation of the new CRA regulations is currently paused pending the resolution of legal challenges to the new regulations. The OCC’s assessment of our compliance with the CRA is taken into account when evaluating any application we submit for, among other things, a merger or the acquisition of another financial institution. Our failure to satisfy our CRA obligations could, at a minimum, result in the denial of such applications and limit our growth.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we were subject to a consent order from the FTC (the “FTC Consent Order”), which resolved allegations that we misrepresented how much money student loan borrowers have saved or would save from financing their loans with us, in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Under the FTC Consent Order, we are prohibited from misrepresenting to consumers how much money they would save by using our products, unless the claims are backed up by reliable evidence.\nWhile we have developed and monitor policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that our compliance policies and procedures will be effective and that we will not be subject to fines and penalties, including with respect to any alleged noncompliance with the FTC Consent Order. Ambiguities in applicable statutes and regulations may leave uncertainty with respect to permitted or restricted conduct and may make compliance with laws, and risk assessment decisions with respect to compliance with laws, difficult and uncertain. In addition, ambiguities make it difficult, in certain circumstances, to determine if, and how compliance violations may be cured. We have in the past and may in the future fail to comply with applicable statutes and regulations even if acting in good faith, or because governmental bodies or courts interpret existing laws or regulations in a more restrictive manner, which have in the past and may in the future lead to regulatory investigations, governmental enforcement actions or private causes of action with respect to our compliance. To resolve issues raised in examinations or other governmental actions, we may be required to take various corrective actions, including changing certain business practices, making refunds or taking other actions that could be financially or competitively detrimental to us. In some cases, regardless of fault, it may be less time-consuming or costly to settle these matters, which may require us to implement certain changes to our business practices, provide remediation to certain individuals or make a settlement payment to a given party or regulatory body. There is no assurance that any future settlements will not have a material adverse effect on our business. \nWe hold state licenses that result in substantial compliance costs, and our business would be adversely affected if our licenses are impaired as a result of noncompliance with those requirements. \nWe currently hold state licenses in connection with our lending activities, student loan servicing activities, securities business, and prior MSB activities. Although we have transitioned our lending products to SoFi Bank, for as long as SoFi Lending Corp. originates, brokers, purchases or master services or services loans, we must comply with certain state licensing requirements and varying compliance requirements. In addition, although we have transferred our digital assets business and relinquished our state money transmitter licenses, we still hold our MSB license. Changes in licensing laws may result in \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nincreased disclosure requirements, increased fees, or may impose other conditions to licensing that we or our personnel are unable to meet. In most states in which we operate, a regulatory agency or agencies regulate and enforce laws relating to loan servicers, brokers, and originators, collection agencies, and MSBs. We are subject to periodic examinations by state and other regulators in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business, which can result in increases in our administrative costs and refunds to borrowers of certain fees earned by us, and we may be required to pay substantial penalties imposed by those regulators due to compliance errors, or we may lose our license or our ability to do business in the jurisdiction otherwise may be impaired. Fines and penalties incurred in one jurisdiction may cause investigations or other actions by regulators in other jurisdictions. \nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain all currently required licenses and permits. If we change or expand our business activities, we may be required to obtain additional licenses before we can engage in those activities. If we apply for a new license, a regulator may determine that we were required to do so at an earlier point in time, and as a result, may impose penalties or refuse to issue the license, which could require us to modify or limit our activities in the relevant state. For example, we have been fined in the past by state regulators for engaging in financial services related activities prior to obtaining a license. Based on changes to our businesses, we may also forfeit certain of our licenses that are no longer required. Regulators may impose conditions, requirements or penalties in connection with the forfeiture of any of our licenses.\nStates may also expand or otherwise modify their current regulations and if such states so act, we may not be able to comply with such updated regulations or maintain all requisite licenses and permits in such states or our costs of compliance with and maintenance of such licenses or permits may materially increase. For example, California, Colorado and Maine have implemented additional regulations related to student loan servicers which impose additional registration, reporting and disclosure requirements and which, if applicable to us, may increase our costs of originating and servicing loans in those states.\nIn addition, the states that currently do not provide extensive regulation of our business may later choose to do so, and if such states so act, we may not be able to obtain or maintain all requisite licenses and permits, which could require us to modify or limit our activities in the relevant state or states. The failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could result in a default under our warehouse facilities, other financial arrangements and/or servicing agreements and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nOur compliance and risk management policies and procedures as a bank, bank holding company and otherwise regulated financial services company may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating compliance and risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk.\nAs a bank, a bank holding company and a financial services company operating in the banking and securities industry, among others, our business exposes us to a number of heightened risks. We have devoted significant resources to developing our compliance and risk management policies and procedures and will continue to do so, but there can be no assurance these are sufficient, especially as our business is rapidly growing and evolving. Nonetheless, our limited operating history in many of the products we offer, our evolving business and our rapid growth make it difficult to predict all of the risks and challenges we may encounter and may increase the risk that our policies and procedures that serve to identify, monitor and manage compliance risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. Further, some controls are manual and are subject to inherent limitations and errors in oversight. This could cause our compliance and other risk management strategies to be ineffective. Other compliance and risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, catastrophic occurrences or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us, which may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Insurance and other traditional risk-shifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures, but they are subject to terms such as deductibles, coinsurance, limits and policy exclusions, as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage, default or insolvency. Any failure to maintain effective compliance and other risk management strategies could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also exposed to heightened regulatory risk because our business is subject to extensive regulation and oversight in a variety of areas, and such regulations are subject to evolving interpretations and application and it can be difficult to predict how they may be applied to our business, particularly as we introduce new products and services and expand into new jurisdictions. Additionally, the regulatory landscape involving digital assets is constantly evolving. Although we have exited our digital assets business, the Company, including SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, may still be subject to regulatory scrutiny related to our prior business practices.\nAlso, due to market volatility, it is difficult to predict how much capital we will need in the future to meet net capital requirements. Any perceived or actual breach of laws and regulations could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is possible that these laws and regulations could be interpreted or applied in a manner that would prohibit, alter or impair our existing or planned products and services. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nRegulatory scrutiny of banking as a service, or BaaS, solutions has increased and may require us to devote significant resources to enhancing our Technology Platform policies, procedures, operations, controls and products, and the failure to satisfy such increased scrutiny may cause regulators to take action against us or our BaaS partners, or result in a loss of one or more of our BaaS partners.\nOur Technology Platform facilitates the provision of BaaS products and services to third parties through various card, deposit, payment, transfer, credit and lending solutions that allow financial technology companies or other third parties to, among other things, connect to sponsor banks’ systems directly via application programming interfaces and cloud infrastructure so they can build banking offerings on top of the sponsor banks’ regulated infrastructure. In addition, our Technology Platform offers an end-to-end core banking platform solution with integrated payment processing. Furthermore, in connection with our Technology Platform's BaaS solutions, we sometimes offer certain program management, data, analytics, compliance and risk management functions. The third parties that use these BaaS solutions include a variety of financial entities, including banks, fintech companies and other financial intermediaries. SoFi Bank is one of the sponsor banks that utilizes our BaaS products and services and may continue to do so in the future.\nFederal bank regulators have increasingly focused on the risks related to BaaS solutions, including risk management, oversight, internal controls, information security, change management and information technology operational resilience, as well as potential systemic risk posed by BaaS solutions to the larger banking industry. Recently, regulators have even brought enforcement actions against financial entities that have allegedly not adequately addressed these concerns while growing their BaaS offerings. Regulators have specifically required these financial entities to enhance oversight of third-party fintech partnerships, improve control frameworks related to anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance, and adopt, implement and adhere to revised and expanded risk-based policies, procedures and processes. If we or any of the fintech clients or sponsor bank partners supported by our Technology Platform were to face regulatory actions that limit the growth of our or their fintech business, or if we were forced to stop growing our Technology Platform, or if any of our fintech clients or sponsor banks were to limit or cease their participation in BaaS solutions, this could have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operation for the Technology Platform segment.\nFurthermore, regulatory scrutiny of BaaS solutions extends directly to middleware providers, such as our Technology Platform, which, in certain circumstances, bear accountability for their partners’ compliance and risk management, including with respect to penalties, fines, and other measures that bank regulatory agencies take in the event of non-compliant activity or risks that are not well controlled. This is particularly true when the BaaS solution includes program management, and compliance and risk management controls, including managing anti-money laundering and fraud risks. In addition, as our fintech and sponsor bank partners face increased regulatory scrutiny, their scrutiny of our services will likely increase and our inability to satisfactorily respond to partner demands could result in those partners moving to different solutions. Assessing and managing risk for our Technology Platform clients in the face of regulatory and client scrutiny has in the past and will continue to require us to devote significant resources to enhancing relevant policies, procedures, operations and products. Finally, as a subsidiary of a bank holding company, any failure of our Technology Platform's BaaS solutions to withstand regulatory scrutiny could reflect badly on our relationship with our regulators and on our overall reputation.\nWhile we believe we are a leader in managing, monitoring and overseeing BaaS relationships with third parties and corresponding technologies, if we are not successful in continuing to enhance our controls for assessing and managing the third-party, anti-money laundering, fraud and information technology risks stemming from certain of our fintech and sponsor bank partnerships, we could be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny with respect to that portion of our business which could subject us to regulatory fines or other penalties, or business or reputational harm, and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to enforcement actions or litigation as a result of our failure to comply with laws and regulations, even though noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional. \nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance in place at the time. \nFor example, we engage in outbound telephone and text communications with consumers, and accordingly must comply with a number of federal and state statutes and regulations that regulate certain such communications, including the TCPA and Telemarketing Sales Rules. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”), and the FTC have responsibility for regulating various aspects of some of these federal laws. Among other requirements, the TCPA requires us to obtain prior express written consent for certain telemarketing calls and to adhere to “do-not-call” registry requirements which, in part, mandate we maintain and regularly update lists of consumers who have chosen not to be called and restrict certain calls \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nto consumers who are on the national do-not-call list. Further, in late 2023 and early 2024, the FCC introduced various new TCPA requirements relating to, among other things, lead generation, prior express written consent to marketing calls made with certain telephony technology and processing opt-outs and do not call requests. These new requirements went into effect in January 2025. In addition to federal laws, many states also have mini-TCPA and other similar consumer protection laws regulating certain telemarketing directed to their residents. Collectively, these federal and state laws limit our ability to communicate with consumers through calls and text messages and reduce the effectiveness of our marketing programs. As currently construed, the TCPA and several state mini-TCPA laws do not distinguish between voice and data, and, as such, SMS/MMS messages are also “calls” for the purpose of these laws.\nFor violations of the TCPA, the law provides for a private right of action under which a plaintiff may recover monetary statutory damages of $500 for each call or text made in violation of the statute. A court may treble the $500 amount upon a finding of a willful or knowing violation. There is no statutory cap on maximum aggregate exposure for TCPA violations (although some courts have applied in TCPA class actions constitutional limits on excessive penalties). Like the TCPA, several mini-TCPA and other similar state laws also provide for a private right of action under which a plaintiff may recover statutory damages of $500 or more for each violative call or text and enhanced statutory if the violation is knowing or willful. An action may be brought by the FCC, a state attorney general, an individual, or a class of individuals. Like other companies that rely on telephone and text communications, we may be subject to putative class action suits alleging violations of the TCPA, and state mini-TCPA and other similar state laws. If in the future we are found to have violated any federal or state law regulating telemarketing, the amount of damages and potential liability could be extensive and adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, we use credit reports in our credit decisioning processes and, accordingly, must comply with FCRA which requires a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer credit report and requires persons that furnish loan payment information to credit bureaus to report such information accurately. We are also required to perform a reasonable investigation in the event we receive indirect disputes from the credit bureaus about the accuracy of our credit reporting for a particular consumer and to update any inaccurate information we discover. Although we have policies and procedures in place to comply with FCRA, we are subject to lawsuits alleging that we failed under FCRA to adequately investigate indirect disputes over credit reporting which we receive from one or more credit bureaus. We have experienced an increase in such FCRA claims since our business has grown and even if we are ultimately successful in defending against such suits, they could involve substantial time and expense to analyze and respond to, could divert management’s attention and other resources from running our business, and could lead to settlements, judgments, fines, penalties or injunctive relief.\nChanges in applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in government enforcement policies and priorities, may negatively impact the management of our business, results of operations, ability to offer certain products or the terms and conditions upon which they are offered, and ability to compete. \nFinancial services regulation is constantly changing, and new laws or regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to operate as currently intended, and cause us to incur significant expense in order to ensure compliance. Federal and state financial services regulators are also enforcing existing laws, regulations, and rules aggressively and enhancing their supervisory expectations regarding the management of legal and regulatory compliance risks. These regulatory changes and uncertainties make our business planning more difficult and could result in changes to our business model and potentially adversely impact our results of operations. Furthermore, to the extent applicable, these laws can impose specific statutory liabilities upon creditors who fail to comply with their provisions and may affect the enforceability of a loan. \nProposals to change the statutes affecting financial services companies are frequently introduced in Congress and state legislatures that, if enacted, may affect their operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. In addition, numerous federal and state regulators and SROs have the authority to promulgate or change regulations that could have a similar effect on our operating environment. We cannot determine with any degree of certainty whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the ultimate impact that any such potential legislation or implementing regulations, or any such potential regulatory actions by federal or state regulators, would have upon our business. \nNew laws, regulations, policy or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business, or reexamination of current practices, could adversely impact our profitability, limit our ability to continue existing or pursue new business activities, require us to change certain of our business practices, affect retention of key personnel, or expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs and/or customer remediation). These changes have in the past and may in the future require us to invest significant resources, and devote significant management attention, to make any necessary changes and could adversely affect our business. For example, the SEC proposed Regulation Best Execution, along with other proposals related to equity market structure, in December 2022. If adopted as proposed, Regulation Best Execution and other proposals would substantially alter existing order routing, execution incentives and business practices. In March 2023, the SEC \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nproposed multiple rules related to privacy and cybersecurity. The SEC’s proposed Rule 10 relating to cybersecurity for market entities (including broker-dealers) would impose additional requirements related to incident reporting, the establishment and periodic review of policies and procedures designed to address cybersecurity risks, and disclosure about cybersecurity risks and significant incidents. On October 13, 2023, the SEC adopted rules relating to providing additional disclosures in the securities lending market. These rules require any covered person that loans a reportable security on behalf of itself or another person to report certain material terms of those loans and related information to FINRA by the end of the day on which the loan is effected. FINRA in turn will make certain information it receives publicly available by the next business day. These regulations could make securities lending more costly, leading to less overall lending activity and a decrease in revenue. On February 22, 2024, the SEC adopted amendments to Rule 605 under Exchange Act that requires disclosures for order executions in national market system (“NMS”) stocks. The amendments modify the type of information required to be disclosed under Rule 605 and expand the scope of reporting entities subject to Rule 605 to include broker-dealers who introduce or carry 100,000 or more customer accounts. Complying with Rule 605 is a new requirement for us. In addition, the Rule itself has been modified to include new definitions, new and modified categories of order types, and new statistical measures of execution quality and other metrics. In May 2024, the SEC adopted amendments to Regulation S-P (“Reg S-P”). The finalized amendments to Reg S-P are designed to address the expanded use of technology and corresponding risks that have emerged since Reg S-P's original adoption and modernize and improve the protection of consumer financial information by certain financial institutions, also known as \"covered institutions\" (including broker-dealers and investment advisers). As adopted, amended Reg S-P (i) requires covered institutions to develop, implement, and maintain written policies and procedures for an incident response program that is reasonably designed to detect, respond to, and recover from unauthorized access to or use of customer information; (ii) requires that the response program include procedures for covered institutions to provide timely notification to affected individuals whose sensitive customer information was, or is reasonably likely to have been, accessed or used without authorization; and (iii) broadens the scope of information covered by Regulation S-P's requirements. On September 18, 2024, the SEC adopted rules that would (i) amend Rule 612 of Regulation NMS to establish a new minimum pricing increment, also known as a tick size, of $0.005 for the quoting of certain NMS stocks; (ii) reduce the access fee caps applicable to stock exchanges under Rule 610 of Regulation NMS (from $0.003 per share (i.e., 30 mils) to $0.001 per share (i.e., 10 mils) and require national securities exchanges to make the amounts of all fees and rebates determinable at the time of execution; and (iii) accelerate the implementation of the round lot and odd-lot information definitions adopted in 2020 under the Market Data Infrastructure Rules (“MDI Rules”) and add information about the best odd-lot order to the definition of odd-lot information. On December 20, 2024, the SEC adopted changes to SEC Rule 15c3-3 and 15c3-1 that modify how broker-dealers protect customer assets and calculate their minimum required “net capital.” These changes, particularly the amendments to Rule 612 and 610 of Regulation NMS, will likely affect the economics for orders executed on national stock exchanges and as a result may impact order routing and order execution decisions by market participants, including third parties on which we rely, like clearing brokers. See “Business, Financial and Operational Risks — We rely on third parties to perform certain key functions, and their failure to perform those functions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations”. Compliance with this rule may impose additional cost on our business. In addition, SoFi Securities’ ability to generate revenue may be impacted as a result of the changes in stock exchange fee caps and the resulting potential changes in order routing and execution decisions. The ultimate effect of these potential changes is uncertain and may impact how SoFi Securities manages and evaluates its compliance with other obligations, such as its obligation to achieve best execution for customer orders. \nSee also “Lawmakers, regulators and other public officials have signaled an increased focus on new or additional laws or regulations that could impact our broker-dealer business and require us to make significant changes to our business model and practices and could result in significant costs to our business or loss of current revenue streams”. Compliance with each of these rules, when applicable and if required, would impose additional costs on our business. To the extent such proposals affect the equity market structure more broadly, our ability to generate revenue may be impaired. There is also the risk that, despite our best efforts, the SEC or FINRA does not view our compliance measures as sufficient. This risk is substantially elevated where regulators adopt a substantial number of new rules in a short time frame. In addition, non-compliance with any adopted requirements would likely result in enforcement action by the SEC or FINRA.\nExtensive regulation and supervision have a negative impact on our ability to compete in a cost-effective manner and may subject us to material compliance costs and penalties.\nThe Company, primarily through its subsidiary SoFi Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole. Many laws and regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. They encourage us to ensure a satisfactory level of lending in defined areas and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to anti-money laundering and customer identification. Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nchanges could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk that regulatory or enforcement agencies and/or consumer advocacy groups may assert that our business practices may violate certain rules, laws and regulations, including anti-discrimination statutes. \nAnti-discrimination statutes, such as the FHA and the ECOA and state law equivalents, prohibit creditors from discriminating against loan applicants and borrowers based on certain characteristics, such as race, religion and national origin. Various federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies, including the Department of Justice and CFPB, take the position that these laws apply not only to intentional discrimination, but also to facially neutral practices that have a disparate impact on a group that shares a characteristic that a creditor may not consider in making credit decisions. State and federal regulators, as well as consumer advocacy groups and plaintiffs’ attorneys, are focusing greater attention on “disparate impact” claims. Similarly, these regulatory agencies and litigants could take the position that the geographical footprint within which we conduct lending activity or the manner in which we advertise loans, disproportionately excludes potential borrowers belonging to a protected class, and constitutes unlawful “redlining”. Although we utilize an automated underwriting process to originate loans, we frequently adjust pricing strategies which increases our risk of inadvertently violating the FHA and the ECOA. These regulatory agencies could also take the position that the underwriting or credit models or algorithms we use produce disparate outcomes or do not produce sufficient information about a credit decision to satisfy applicant notification requirements under ECOA. In addition to reputational harm, violations of the FHA and the ECOA can result in actual damages, punitive damages, injunctive or equitable relief, attorneys’ fees and civil money penalties. \nOur investment adviser and broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA.\nWe offer investment management services through SoFi Wealth which sponsors private investment funds that invest in asset-backed securitizations. SoFi Wealth (the “Investment Adviser”) is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), which does not imply any level of skill or training, and is subject to regulation by the SEC. SoFi Securities is an affiliated SEC-registered broker-dealer and FINRA member. We offer cash management accounts, which are brokerage products, through SoFi Securities. \nThe Investment Adviser operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to, among other things, the anti-fraud provisions of the Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions that apply to its relationships with our members who are its advisory clients, as well as the funds managed by the Investment Adviser. These provisions and duties also impose certain restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our members, fund investors and our investments, including for example restrictions on transactions with our affiliates. Our Investment Adviser is also subject to other requirements under the Advisers Act and related regulations. These additional requirements relate to matters including, among others, maintaining an effective and comprehensive compliance programs and record-keeping and reporting and disclosure requirements. In recent years, the SEC proposed and, in some cases, adopted amendments to the Advisers Act rules, which present a number of additional significant and burdensome compliance challenges for registered investment advisers. In addition, our Investment Adviser has been in the past, and will be in the future, subject to SEC examination. Moreover, the Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. The Investment Adviser is also subject to applicable state securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements include prohibitions of individuals from associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registration and other censures and fines. Even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator was small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing members or fail to gain new members. See Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”.\nOur subsidiary, SoFi Securities, is an affiliated SEC-registered broker-dealer and FINRA member. The securities industry is highly regulated, including under federal, state and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, and we may be adversely affected by regulatory changes related to suitability of financial products, supervision, sales practices, advertising, application of fiduciary standards, best execution and market structure, any of which could limit our business and damage our reputation. FINRA has adopted extensive regulatory requirements relating to sales practices, advertising, registration of personnel, compliance and supervision, and compensation and disclosure, to which SoFi Securities and its personnel are subject. FINRA and the SEC also have the authority to conduct examinations of SoFi Securities and may also conduct administrative proceedings. Additionally, material expansions of the business in which SoFi Securities engages are subject to approval by FINRA. This could delay, or even prevent, the firm’s ability to expand its securities and brokerage offerings in the \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nfuture. Furthermore, SoFi Securities is subject to increased governance in its role as an affiliate of a national bank under guidance from the OCC regarding RNDIPs. OCC guidance, which was further updated in June 2024, requires that banks implement effective oversight and monitoring of relevant RNDIP arrangements to ensure that, among other things, sales transactions and recommendations to retail investors comply with SEC regulations. Such oversight and monitoring may increase costs for SoFi Securities and SoFi Bank and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and any failure by SoFi Bank to effectively oversee and monitor such arrangements could result in harm to members and financial and reputational harm to us.\nFrom time to time, SoFi Securities and the Investment Adviser may be threatened with or named as a defendant in lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims. As previously noted, these entities are also subject to regulatory examinations and inspections by regulators (including the SEC and FINRA, as applicable). Compliance and trading problems or other deficiencies or weaknesses that are reported to regulators, such as the SEC and FINRA, by dissatisfied members or others, or that are identified by regulators themselves are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against SoFi Securities and the Investment Adviser by members or disciplinary action being taken by regulators against us or our personnel. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or our own policies and procedures could result in fines, litigation, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, which could have a material effect on our overall financial results. For example, in December 2023, FINRA found that SoFi Securities failed to establish, maintain, and enforce a supervisory system reasonably designed to supervise its fully paid securities lending offerings. Even if a sanction imposed against us or our personnel is small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity arising from the imposition of sanctions against us by regulators could harm our reputation and our brand and lead to material legal, regulatory and financial exposure (including fines and other penalties), cause us to lose existing members or fail to gain new members. In addition, in the normal course of business, SoFi Securities and the Investment Adviser discuss matters raised by its regulators during regulatory examinations or otherwise upon their inquiry. These matters could also result in censures, fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nIn addition to the broker-dealer proposals described above under “Changes in applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in government enforcement policies and priorities, may negatively impact the management of our business, results of operations, ability to offer certain products or the terms and conditions upon which they are offered, and ability to compete”, a substantial number of proposed rules for investment advisers were introduced in 2023 and 2024 and may be adopted or re-proposed this year. These proposals cover material regulatory topics, including: (i) environmental, social, and governance issues for investment advisers and funds; (ii) outsourcing by investment advisers; (iii) safeguarding and custody of client assets; and (iv) expansion of the scope of activities and relationships that make a person an investment advice fiduciary under Section 3(21) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code. If enacted, compliance with each of these proposed rules would impose additional costs on our business. There is also the risk that, despite our best efforts, the SEC does not view our compliance measures as sufficient. This risk is substantially elevated where regulators adopt a substantial number of new rules in a short time frame.\nWe transferred our digital assets-related trading services to comply with regulations governing bank holding companies; this transfer could adversely impact our member relationships and our reputation.\nUntil early 2024, we offered virtual currency and digital asset-related trading services through SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, a subsidiary licensed and registered with various governmental authorities as a MSB, money transmitter, virtual currency business or the equivalent. In connection with our approval as a bank holding company in February 2022, the Federal Reserve determined that SoFi Digital Assets, LLC was engaged in certain digital asset-related activities that the Federal Reserve has not found to be permissible for a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act and Regulation Y. Section 4(a)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act permitted us to continue our digital assets related offering for a two-year conformance period from the date we became a bank holding company. In compliance with the requirement that we conform our activities to those permissible for a bank holding company, by the end of January 2024, we ceased offering digital-asset related trading services in all states. We provided a majority of our members with the option to either close their digital asset account or migrate their digital assets accounts to Blockchain.com. All transaction fees from any sales from digital assets accounts were reimbursed. As part of our transfer of our digital asset-related activities we entered into a referral arrangement with Blockchain.com, and we have and may continue to enter into additional referral arrangements with other companies that can provide digital-asset related trading services to our members. Although we do not expect the transfer of our digital asset-related activities or entry into the referral arrangements to have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation or financial results, we cannot guarantee that our members will not experience a negative impact with respect to their digital asset positions. Furthermore, there is no guarantee we will not face member dissatisfaction or litigation, or harm to our reputation, or adverse regulatory consequences, from such transfer of digital assets-related trading services.\nFurthermore, if our prior digital asset-related trading services are the subject of regulatory scrutiny or enforcement actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and reputation. There has been a significant \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\namount of guidance, reports, and public statements issued by federal and state financial regulators regarding the legal permissibility of, and supervisory considerations relating to, financial institutions engaging in digital assets-related activities. Many U.S. regulators, including the SEC, FinCEN, the CFTC, the IRS, and state regulators including the New York State Department of Financial Services, have made official pronouncements, pursued cases against businesses in the digital assets space or issued guidance or rules regarding the treatment of Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Both federal and state agencies have instituted enforcement actions against those violating their interpretation of existing laws. Other U.S. and many state agencies have offered little or incomplete official guidance regarding the treatment of digital assets. If the SEC, CFTC or another federal or state regulator alleges that any assets we offered were securities or derivatives, or that we have violated any other federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, we could face potential liability, including an enforcement action or private class action lawsuits, and face the costs of defending ourselves in the action, including potential fines, penalties, reputation harm, and potential loss of revenue. See “We may become subject to enforcement actions or litigation as a result of our failure to comply with laws and regulations, even though noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional”.\nFailure to comply with anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions regulations, and similar laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences. \nVarious laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, such as the BSA, the Dodd-Frank Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act, impose certain anti-money laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services. Under these laws and regulations, financial institutions are broadly defined to include banks and MSBs such as money transmitters. In 2013, FinCEN issued guidance regarding the applicability of the BSA to administrators and exchangers of convertible virtual currency, clarifying that they are MSBs, and more specifically, money transmitters. The BSA requires banks and MSBs to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity, and maintain transaction records, among other requirements. State regulators may impose similar requirements on licensed money transmitters. In addition, our contracts with financial institution partners and other third parties may contractually require us to maintain an anti-money laundering program. SoFi Bank is subject to the regulatory and supervisory jurisdiction of the OCC with respect to the BSA and its implementing regulations applicable to banks. Our subsidiary, SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, remains registered with FinCEN as an MSB. Registration as an MSB subjects us to the regulatory and supervisory jurisdiction of FinCEN and the IRS, the anti-money laundering provisions of the BSA and its implementing regulations applicable to MSBs. Although we have exited our digital assets business, the Company, including SoFi Digital Assets, LLC, may still be subject to regulatory scrutiny related to our prior business practices.\nWe are also subject to economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC, which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, terrorists or terrorist organizations, and other sanctioned persons and entities. \nOur failure to comply with anti-money laundering, economic and trade sanctions regulations, and similar laws could subject us to substantial civil and criminal penalties, or result in the loss or restriction of our national bank charter, MSB or broker-dealer registrations and state licenses, or liability under our contracts with third parties, which may significantly affect our ability to conduct some aspects of our business. Changes in this regulatory environment, including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements by the government, may significantly affect or change the manner in which we currently conduct some aspects of our business. \nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws, and noncompliance with such laws can subject us to significant adverse consequences, including criminal or civil liability, and harm our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. domestic bribery laws and other U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public sector. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. Although our operations are currently concentrated in the U.S., as we increase our international cross-border business and expand operations abroad, we have engaged and may further engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our services and to obtain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. The \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nfailure to comply with any such laws could subject us to criminal or civil liability, cause us significant reputational harm and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct our business operations through subsidiaries and may in the future rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for a substantial amount of our cash flows.\nWe may in the future depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund payments on our obligations, including any debt obligations we may incur. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds to or from certain subsidiaries, including SoFi Securities and SoFi Bank. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to us, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations, including any debt obligations we may incur and otherwise conduct our business by, among other things, reducing our liquidity in the form of corporate cash. In addition to negatively affecting our business, a significant decrease in our liquidity could also reduce investor confidence in us. Certain rules and regulations of the SEC and FINRA may limit the extent to which our broker-dealer subsidiaries may distribute capital to us. For example, under FINRA rules applicable to SoFi Securities, a dividend in excess of 10% of a member firm’s excess net capital may not be paid without FINRA’s prior written approval. In addition, the OCC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. In addition, under the National Bank Act, SoFi Bank generally may, without prior approval of the OCC, declare a dividend but only so long as the total amount of all dividends (common and preferred), including the proposed dividend, in the current year do not exceed net income for the current year to date plus retained net income for the prior two years. Compliance with these rules may impede our ability to receive dividends, distributions and other payments from SoFi Securities and SoFi Bank.\nWe have in the past, continue to be, and may in the future be subject to inquiries, exams, pending investigations, or enforcement matters. \nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation and oversight under federal, state, and applicable international laws. From time to time, in the normal course of business, we have received and may receive or be subject to inquiries or investigations by state and federal regulatory or enforcement agencies and bodies, such as the CFPB, SEC, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the FHFA, the VA, the state attorneys general, state financial regulatory agencies, other state or federal agencies and SROs like FINRA. We also have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries from state regulatory agencies regarding requirements to obtain licenses from or register with those states, including in states where we have previously determined that we are not required to obtain such a license or be registered with the state. In addition, we have been threatened with or named as a defendant in lawsuits, arbitrations and administrative claims involving securities, consumer financial services and other matters. We are also subject to periodic regulatory examinations and inspections. Compliance and trading problems or other deficiencies or weaknesses that are reported to regulators, such as the OCC, SEC, FINRA, the CFPB or state regulators, by dissatisfied customers or others, or that are identified by regulators themselves, are investigated by such regulators, and may, if pursued, result in formal claims being filed against us by customers or disciplinary action being taken against us or our employees by regulators or enforcement agencies. In addition, we could be required to disclose such federal, state, or local government actions or court orders to the CFPB’s registry of corporate offenders that have broken consumer laws, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase our legal and compliance costs, increase demand on our systems and resources, and adversely impact our reputation. To resolve issues raised in examinations or other governmental actions, we may be required to take various corrective actions, including changing certain business practices, making refunds or taking other actions that could be financially or competitively detrimental to us.\nAny such inquiries, investigations, lawsuits, arbitrations, administrative claims or other inquiries have in the past and could in the future involve substantial time and expense to analyze and respond to, divert management’s attention and other resources from running our business, and lead to fines, penalties, injunctive relief, and the need to obtain additional licenses that we do not currently possess. Our involvement in any such matters, whether tangential or otherwise and even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation, lead to additional investigations and enforcement actions from other agencies or litigants, and further divert management attention and resources from the operation of our business. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions arising out of any state or federal inquiries we receive could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nLawmakers, regulators and other public officials have signaled an increased focus on new or additional laws or regulations that could impact our broker-dealer business and require us to make significant changes to our business model and practices and could result in significant costs to our business or loss of current revenue streams.\nVarious lawmakers, regulators and other public officials have made statements about business practices in which we and other broker-dealers engage, including SoFi Securities, and signaled potential new or additional laws or regulations that, if acted upon, could impact our business. For example, a focus by regulators and lawmakers on PFOF, exchange rebates, and related conflicts of interest have resulted in new proposed rules. Additionally, the SEC has proposed new requirements regarding best execution (Regulation Best Execution), PFOF and a rule to prohibit volume-based transaction pricing in connection with the execution of agency-related orders in national market system stock. The SEC also issued an order in September 2023 directing the equity exchanges and FINRA to file a new national marketing system plan and the SEC is soliciting comments on the proposed national marketing system plan. This order and other proposals have the potential to substantially reshape U.S. equities markets in intended and unintended ways, and to substantially alter existing order routing, execution incentives and business practices. \nTo the extent that the SEC, FINRA or other regulatory authorities or legislative bodies adopt additional regulations or legislation in respect of any of these areas or relating to any other aspect of our business, we could face a heightened risk of potential regulatory violations and could be required to make significant changes to our business model and practices, which changes may not be successful. Any of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any negative publicity surrounding PFOF practices generally, or our implementation of this practice, could harm our brand and reputation. For more information about the potential impact of legal and regulatory changes, see “We may become subject to enforcement actions or litigation as a result of our failure to comply with laws and regulations, even though noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional”.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information, and adversely affect our business opportunities. \nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by them. For example, we are subject to the GLBA and implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, the GLBA (i) imposes certain limitations on the ability to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and (ii) requires certain disclosures to consumers about our practices for the collection, sharing and safeguarding of their information and their right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions). The GLBA and other state laws also require that we implement and maintain certain security measures, policies and procedures to protect personal information. \nFurthermore, legislators and/or regulators are increasingly adopting new and/or amending existing privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices; our policies and practices related to the collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information; and some of our current or planned business activities. New requirements, originating from new or amended laws, could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. The CFPB, for example, finalized its Personal Financial Data Rights Rule, which could require us to build an application that allows our customers to obtain their personal financial information and for authorized third parties to obtain our customers’ information. This could increase our compliance costs, volatility in our customer base, and the risk of fraudulent access to consumers’ personal financial information.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, information security and data protection laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer and/or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services (such as products or services that involve sharing information with third parties or storing sensitive credit card information), which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. A failure by us or a third-party contractor providing services to us to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws, regulations, self-regulatory requirements or industry guidelines, or our terms of use with our users, may result in sanctions, statutory or contractual damages or litigation (including class actions) and may subject us to reputational harm. Additionally, there is always a danger that regulators can attempt to assert authority over our business in the area of privacy, information security and data protection. Furthermore, if our vendors and/or service providers are or become subject to laws and regulations in the jurisdictions that have enacted more stringent and expansive legislation applicable to privacy, information and/or data protection, the costs that these vendors and service providers must incur in becoming compliant may be passed along to us, resulting in increasing costs on our business. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nConcerns in our ability, perceived or otherwise, to protect the privacy and security of personal information may affect our ability to retain and engage new and existing members, clients, investors, and employees, and thereby affect our financial condition. Furthermore, failure to comply or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules, and regulations may subject us to examinations, investigations, and general heightened scrutiny that may cause us to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPrivacy requirements, including notice and opt-out requirements, under the GLBA and FCRA are enforced by the FTC, the OCC and by the CFPB through UDAAP and are a standard component of OCC and CFPB compliance and examinations. State entities also may initiate actions for alleged violations of privacy or security requirements under state law. Our failure to comply with privacy, information security and data protection laws could result in potentially significant regulatory investigations and government actions, litigation, fines or sanctions, consumer or merchant actions and damage to our reputation and brand, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nIf we collect and process personal data relating to individuals in the EU or the United Kingdom (the “UK”) as a result of either offering goods or services into the EU or UK, or monitoring the behavior of EU and UK individuals, we will be required to comply with stringent privacy and data protection laws. Within the EU, legislators have adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “EU GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018. The EU GDPR will impose additional obligations and risks upon our business when we collect and process personal data about individuals from the EU and UK, which may increase substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any noncompliance. For example, the EU GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the EU GDPR, including requirements relating to having legal bases and conditions for processing personal data and transferring such personal data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or the UK, including to the U.S., providing details to those individuals regarding the processing of their personal data, keeping personal data secure, having data processing agreements with third parties who process personal data, responding to individuals’ requests to exercise their rights in respect of their personal data, where required reporting security breaches involving personal data to the competent national data protection authority and affected individuals, where required, appointing data protection officers, where required conducting data protection impact assessments for high risk processing, and record-keeping. We may incur substantial expense in complying with obligations imposed by the EU GDPR and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. \nIn addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the EU GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the “UK GDPR”. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Noncompliance with the UK GDPR may result in significant monetary penalties. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU GDPR, the EC has issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. The UK Government introduced a Data Protection and Digital Information Bill which failed in the UK legislative process. A new Data (Use and Access) Bill (“UK Bill”) has been introduced into parliament. If passed, the final version of the UK Bill may have the effect of further altering the similarities between the UK and EEA data protection regime and threaten the UK Adequacy Decision from the EC. Further, this may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.\nIn addition, around the world many jurisdictions outside of Europe are also considering and/or have enacted comprehensive data protection legislation. For example, we are subject to stringent privacy and data protection requirements in Hong Kong. Also, many jurisdictions where we may seek to expand our business in the future are also considering and/or have enacted comprehensive data protection legislation. Additional jurisdictions with stringent data protection laws include Brazil and China. \nThe regulatory framework governing the collection, processing, storage, use and sharing of certain information, particularly financial and other personal information, is rapidly evolving and is likely to continue to be subject to uncertainty and varying interpretations. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with laws in other jurisdictions or with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. We therefore cannot yet fully determine the impact existing and/or future laws, rules, regulations and industry standards may have on our business or operations. Any failure or perceived failure by us, or any third parties with which we do business, to comply with our posted privacy policies, changing consumer expectations, evolving laws, rules and regulations, \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nindustry standards, or contractual obligations to which we or such third parties are or may become subject, may result in actions or other claims against us by governmental entities or private actors, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources or the imposition of significant fines, penalties or other liabilities. In addition, any such action, particularly to the extent we were found to be guilty of violations or otherwise liable for damages, would damage our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny such laws, rules, regulations and industry standards may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions, subject to differing interpretations or may conflict with our current or future practices. Additionally, our customers may be subject to differing privacy laws, rules and legislation, which may mean that they require us to be bound by varying contractual requirements applicable to certain other jurisdictions. Adherence to such contractual requirements may impact our collection, use, processing, storage, sharing and disclosure of various types of information including financial information and other personal information, and may mean we become bound by, or voluntarily comply with, self-regulatory or other industry standards relating to these matters that may further change as laws, rules and regulations evolve. Complying with these requirements and changing our policies and practices may be onerous and costly, and we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to regulatory, legislative and other developments. These changes may in turn impair our ability to offer our existing or planned features, products and services and/or increase our cost of doing business. As we expand our customer base, these requirements may vary from customer to customer, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. \nWe publicly post documentation regarding our practices concerning the collection, processing, use and disclosure of data. Although we endeavor to comply with our published policies and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or any applicable privacy, security or data protection, information security or consumer-protection related laws, regulations, orders or industry standards could expose us to costly litigation, significant awards, fines or judgments, civil and/or criminal penalties or negative publicity, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The publication of our privacy policy and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices, which could, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt may be difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection. \nOur ability to provide our products and services to our members and technology platform clients depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We may be unable to protect our proprietary technology effectively, which would allow competitors to duplicate our business processes and know-how, and adversely affect our ability to compete with them. A third party may attempt to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology without our consent. The pursuit of a claim against a third party for infringement of our intellectual property could be costly, and there can be no guarantee that any such efforts would be successful. \nIn addition, our platform or those of third-party service providers that we utilize may infringe upon claims of third-party intellectual property, and we may face intellectual property challenges from such other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes, or in receiving amounts due to us under indemnification obligations from third-party service providers. The costs of defending any such claims or litigation could be significant and, if we are unsuccessful, could result in a requirement that we pay significant damages or licensing fees, which would negatively impact our financial performance. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology from intellectual property challenges, our ability to maintain our platform could be adversely affected. \nSome aspects of our platform include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business. \nWe incorporate open source software into our proprietary platform and into other processes supporting our business. Such open source software may include software covered by licenses like the GNU General Public License and the Apache License or other open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that limits our use of the software, inhibits certain aspects of our platform and negatively affects our business operations. \nSome open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software we use. If portions of our proprietary platform are determined to be subject to an open source license, or if the license terms for the open source software that we incorporate change, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our platform or change our business activities. In addition to risks related to license requirements, the use of open source software can lead to greater \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nrisks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with the use of open source software cannot be eliminated and could adversely affect our business. \nLitigation, regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs, negative publicity, changes to our business model, and requirements resulting in increased expenses. \nOur business is subject to increased risks of litigation and regulatory actions as a result of a number of factors and from various sources, including as a result of the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of state and federal enforcement agencies on the financial services industry. \nFrom time to time, we are also involved in, or the subject of, reviews, requests for information, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by state and federal governmental agencies and SROs, regarding our business activities and our qualifications to conduct our business in certain jurisdictions, which has in the past and could in the future subject us to significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices and other requirements resulting in increased expenses and diminished earnings. Our involvement in any such matter also has in the past and could in the future cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor. Moreover, any settlement, or any consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by a government agency, may prompt litigation or additional investigations or proceedings as other litigants or other government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. See “If we fail to comply with federal and state consumer protection laws, rules, regulations and guidance, our business could be adversely affected” for a discussion of the FTC Consent Order. \nIn addition, a number of participants in the financial services industry have been the subject of: putative class action lawsuits; state attorney general actions and other state regulatory actions; federal regulatory enforcement actions, including actions relating to alleged unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices; violations of state licensing and lending laws, including state usury laws; actions alleging discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender or other prohibited bases; and allegations of noncompliance with various state and federal laws and regulations relating to originating and servicing consumer finance loans. For example, we entered into a settlement agreement on April 18, 2022 related to a putative class action in which it was alleged that we engaged in unlawful lending discrimination through policies and practices by making applicants who are conditional permanent residents or DACA holders ineligible for loans or eligible only with a co-signer who is U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. We made an aggregate payment to the class and the class counsel in an immaterial amount. In addition, as a financial services company, errors in performing settlement functions, including clerical, technological and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities could lead to censures, fines or other sanctions imposed by applicable regulatory authorities as well as losses and liabilities in related lawsuits and proceedings brought by transaction counterparties and others.\nThe environment of increased regulatory compliance efforts and enhanced regulatory enforcement in the past few years has resulted in significant operational and compliance costs and may prevent us from providing certain products and services. There is no assurance that these regulatory matters or other factors will not, in the future, affect how we conduct our business and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, legal proceedings brought under state consumer protection statutes or under several of the various federal consumer financial services statutes may result in a separate fine for each violation of the statute, which, particularly in the case of class action lawsuits, could result in damages substantially in excess of the amounts we earned from the underlying activities. \nIn addition, from time to time, through our operational and compliance controls, we identify compliance and other issues that require us to make operational changes and, depending on the nature of the issue, result in financial remediation to impacted members. These self-identified issues and voluntary remediation payments could be significant, depending on the issue and the number of members impacted, and also could generate litigation or regulatory investigations that subject us to additional risk. See Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings”.\nChanges in tax law and differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely impact our financial statements. \nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions and are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governments. U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations. U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax authorities may interpret tax laws and regulations differently than we do and challenge tax positions that we have taken. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest or penalties that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, future \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nchanges to U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax laws and regulations could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. Proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Several of the proposals currently being considered, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our future effective tax rate, income tax expense, and cash flows. Further, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the “OECD”) has issued guidelines that change long-standing tax principles and certain countries have adopted OECD guidelines. These guidelines create tax uncertainty as countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the guidelines. \nWe will be adversely affected if we, or any of our subsidiaries, are determined to have been subject to registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. \nWe are currently not deemed to be an “investment company” subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). No opinion or no-action position has been requested of the SEC on our status as an Investment Company. There is no guarantee we will continue to be exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act and were we to be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, the increased reporting and operating requirements could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. \nIn addition, if the SEC or a court of competent jurisdiction were to find that we are in violation of the Investment Company Act for having failed to register as an investment company thereunder, possible consequences include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) the SEC could apply to a district court to enjoin the violation; (ii) we could be sued by investors in us and in our securities for damages caused by the violation; and (iii) any contract to which we are a party that is made in, or whose performance involves a, violation of the Investment Company Act would be unenforceable by any party to the contract unless a court were to find that under the circumstances enforcement would produce a more equitable result than nonenforcement and would not be inconsistent with the purposes of the Investment Company Act. Should we be subjected to any or all of the foregoing, our business would be materially and adversely affected. \nPersonnel and Business Continuity RisksWe rely on our management team and will require additional key personnel to grow our business, and the loss of key management members or key employees, or an inability to hire key personnel, could harm our business. \nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our senior management, who have significant experience in the financial services and technology industries, are responsible for our core competencies and would be difficult to replace. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are usually in high demand even in an uncertain economy, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all, and our other employees may be required to take on additional responsibilities. Furthermore, many candidates evaluate year over year stock growth trends for a sense of the potential long-term value of their proposed stock awards. The volatility of the market price of our common stock could harm our ability to attract and retain talent. Our executive officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected. \nThe job market and the optimization of our workforce creates a challenge and potential risk as we strive to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce. \nCompetition for certain of our employees, including highly skilled technology and product professionals responsible for the design, engineering and operation of systems, is competitive, which can present a risk as we compete for experienced candidates, especially if the competition is able to offer more attractive financial terms of employment. This risk extends to our current employee population. We also invest significant time and expense in engaging and developing our employees, which also increases their value to other companies that may seek to recruit them. Turnover can result in significant replacement costs and lost productivity. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, in the past, we laid off a relatively small number of employees even though we intend to continue to hire in other areas. As our organization continues to evolve, and we are required to implement and optimize our business and organizational structures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance. See also “We transitioned to a flexible-first workforce model, which could subject us to increased business continuity and cyber risks, as well as other operational challenges and risks that could significantly harm our business and operations” for more information on the impact of a flexible workforce model on corporate culture and employee retention.\nIn addition, U.S. immigration policy has made it more difficult for qualified foreign nationals to obtain or maintain work visas under the H-1B classification. These H-1B visa limitations make it more difficult and/or more expensive for us to hire the skilled professionals we need to execute our growth strategy, especially engineering, data analytics and risk management personnel, and may adversely impact our business. \nWe transitioned to a flexible-first workforce model, which could subject us to increased business continuity and cyber risks, as well as other operational challenges and risks that could significantly harm our business and operations.\nWe offer most of our employees the choice of working full time in the office, a hybrid approach, or full-time remote. In 2023 we announced an increase in in-office collaboration for non-remote employees who are returning to the office for a specified number of days per month, varying by business team. This return to the office for non-remote employees is limited, and we expect many employees to continue to work remotely for a number of days per week. As a result, we expect to continue to be subject to the challenges and risks of having a remote workforce, as well as new challenges and risks from operating with a hybrid workforce. For example, our employees are accessing our servers remotely through home or other networks to perform their job responsibilities. Such security systems may be less secure than those used in our offices, which may subject us to increased security risks, including cybersecurity-related events, and expose us to risks of data or financial loss and associated disruptions to our business operations. Additionally, employees who access company data and systems remotely may not have access to technology that is as robust as that in our offices, which could place additional pressure on our user infrastructure and third parties that are not easily mitigated. These risks include home internet availability affecting work continuity and efficiency, and additional dependencies on third-party communication tools, such as instant messaging and online meeting platforms. We may also be exposed to risks associated with the locations of remote employees, including compliance with local laws and regulations or exposure to compromised internet infrastructure. Allowing our employees to work remotely may create intellectual property risk if employees create intellectual property on our behalf while residing in a jurisdiction with unenforced or uncertain intellectual property laws. Further, if employees fail to inform us of changes in their work location, we may be exposed to additional risks without our knowledge. While most of our operations can be performed remotely and we believe have operated effectively, there is no guarantee that this will continue or that we will continue to be as effective while operating a flexible-first workforce model because our team is dispersed.\nAdditionally, operating our business with both remote and in-person workers, or workers who work in flexible locations and on flexible schedules, could have a negative impact on our corporate culture, decrease the ability of our workforce to collaborate and communicate effectively, decrease innovation and productivity, or negatively affect workforce morale. If we are unable to manage the cybersecurity and other risks of a flexible-first workforce model, and maintain our corporate culture and workforce morale, our business could be harmed or otherwise adversely impacted.\nOur business is subject to the risks of natural disasters, power outages, telecommunications failures and similar events, including public health crises, and to interruptions by human-made problems such as terrorism, cyberattacks, and other actions, which may impact the demand for our products or our members’ ability to repay their loans. \nEvents beyond our control may damage our ability to maintain our platform and provide services to our members. Such events include, but are not limited to, hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, public health crises, power or other outages, telecommunications failures and similar events. Despite any precautions we may take, system interruptions and delays could occur if there is a natural disaster, if a third-party provider closes a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or if there are other unanticipated problems at our leased facilities. Because we rely heavily on our servers, computer and communications systems and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality service to our members, disruptions could harm our ability to effectively run our business. Moreover, our members and customers face similar risks, which could directly or indirectly impact our business. We currently use AWS and would be unable to switch instantly to another system in the event of failure to access AWS. This means that an outage of AWS could result in our system being unavailable for a significant period of time. Terrorism, cyberattacks and other criminal, tortious or unintentional actions could also give rise to significant disruptions to our operations. In addition, the long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and our industry in particular are unclear, however we recognize that there are inherent \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nclimate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, our offices may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. We have large offices located in the San Francisco Bay Area and Salt Lake City, Utah, regions that are prone to events such as seismic activity and severe weather, that have experienced and may continue to experience, climate-related events and at an increasing rate. Examples include drought and water scarcity, warmer temperatures, wildfires and air quality impacts and power shut-offs associated with wildfire prevention. The increasing intensity of drought throughout California and Utah and annual periods of wildfire danger increase the probability of planned power outages. Although we maintain a disaster response plan and insurance, such events could disrupt our business, the business of our partners or third-party suppliers, and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to maintain and resume operations. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures or other disruptions. Comparable natural and other risks may reduce demand for our products or cause our members to suffer significant losses and/or incur significant disruption in their respective operations, which may affect their ability to satisfy their obligations towards us. All of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nEmployee misconduct, which can be difficult to detect and deter, could harm our reputation and subject us to significant legal liability. \nWe operate in an industry in which integrity and the confidence of our members is of critical importance. We are subject to risks of errors and misconduct by our employees that could adversely affect our business, including: \n•engaging in misrepresentation or fraudulent activities when marketing or performing online brokerage and other services to our members; \n•improperly using or disclosing confidential information of our members, technology platform clients, or other parties; \n•concealing unauthorized or unsuccessful activities; or \n•otherwise not complying with applicable laws and regulations or our internal policies or procedures. \nThere have been numerous highly-publicized cases of fraud and other misconduct by financial services industry employees. The precautions that we take to detect and deter employee misconduct might not be effective. If any of our employees engage in illegal, improper, or suspicious activity or other misconduct, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, member relationships, and our ability to attract new members. We also could become subject to regulatory sanctions and significant legal liability, which could cause serious harm to our financial condition, reputation, member relationships and prospects of attracting additional members. \nRisk Management and Financial Reporting RisksIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline. \nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, a report by management on internal control over financial reporting and an attestation of our independent registered public accounting firm are required. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our annual reports on Form 10-K. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm must also attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports on Form 10-K. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, the applicable stock exchange or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nThe annual internal control assessment required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley has diverted, and may in the future divert, internal resources and we have and may experience higher operating expenses, higher independent auditor and consulting fees in the future. To comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act and any new or revised accounting rules in the future, as necessary, we have, and may in the future further, work to upgrade the Company’s legacy information technology systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. If we are unable to hire the additional accounting and finance staff necessary to comply with these requirements, we may need to retain additional outside consultants. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn addition, our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of poor design and changes in our business. For example, our continuing growth and expansion in globally dispersed markets, such as our acquisition of Technisys, has placed and may in the future place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting, as acquisition targets may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We do not conduct a formal evaluation of companies’ internal control over financial reporting prior to an acquisition. We may be required to hire additional staff and incur substantial costs to implement the necessary new internal controls at companies we acquire. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect the results of assessments by our independent registered public accounting firm and their attestation reports. If we or, if required, our independent registered public accounting firm, are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could negatively impact the price of our securities. \nAs a result of any material weakness, restatement, change in accounting, or other matters raised or that may in the future be raised by the SEC, we may face potential litigation or other disputes, which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, contractual claims or other claims arising from the restatement and material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements. We can provide no assurance that litigation or disputes will not arise in the future. Any such litigation or dispute related to our financial statements or internal controls, whether successful or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot assure you that there will not be additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting now or in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could cause us to fail to timely detect errors and severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. \nWe adjust our total number of members in the event a member is removed in accordance with our terms of service, and our total member count in any one period may not yet reflect such adjustments.\nWe adjust our total number of members in the event a member is removed in accordance with our terms of service. This could occur for a variety of reasons—including fraud or pursuant to certain legal processes or if a member requests that we close their account in accordance with our terms of service—and, as our terms of service evolve together with our business practices, product offerings and applicable regulations, additional grounds for removing members from our total member count could occur. The determination that a member should be removed in accordance with our terms of service is subject to an evaluation process, following the completion, and based on the results, of which, relevant members and their associated products are removed from our total member count. However, depending on the length of the evaluation process, that removal may not take place in the same period in which the member was added to our member count or the same period in which the circumstances leading to their removal occurred. For this reason, our total member count in any one period may not yet reflect such adjustments. In any given period, we estimate that up to 10% of our members may be under evaluation for removal in accordance with our terms of service; however, we cannot assure you that this percentage in any period will not be more significant and have an adverse impact on our stock price or results of operations.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. \nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.\nWe incur significant costs and expend significant time and effort, as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management intends to continue to devote substantial time to new risk management and compliance initiatives. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and Nasdaq. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\namount of time to these risk management and compliance initiatives. Furthermore, new rules and regulations or changes to existing rules and regulations in the future may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, its board committees or as executive officers.\nDealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies can be time consuming, which may result in our executive officers devoting less time to the management and growth of the business. We continue to evaluate whether we have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal control over financial reporting required of public companies. We have in the past and may in the future expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company, which has caused and may in the future cause our operating costs to increase. See “If we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline”.\nOur risk management processes and procedures may not be effective. \nOur risk management processes and procedures seek to appropriately balance risk and return and mitigate risks. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and control the types of risk to which we are subject, including interest rate risk, credit risk, deposit risk, market risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk, operational risk, cybersecurity risk, and reputational risk. Credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when a loan obligor fails to meet the terms of a loan repayment obligation, the loan enters default, and if uncured results in financial loss of remaining principal and interest to the loan purchaser. Our exposure to credit risk mainly arises from our lending activities, including SoFi Credit Card. Deposit risk refers to accelerated availability of depositor funds, prior to settlement, risk of ACH returns or merchant settlements, and transactional limits that may be applied to deposit accounts. Market risk is the risk of loss due to changes in external market factors, such as interest rates, asset prices, and foreign exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that our financial position or results of operations could be positively or negatively impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates. We may in the future be subject to increasing foreign currency exchange rate risk with our acquisition of Technisys, a foreign company, and we continue to pursue a diversified durable growth strategy with expansion via new products and geographies. Liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by an inability, or perceived inability, to meet obligations (e.g., current and future cash flow needs) and support business growth. We actively monitor our liquidity position at the broker-dealer and SoFi Bank. Strategic risk is the risk from changes in the business environment, ineffective business strategies, improper implementation of decisions or inadequate responsiveness to changes in the business and competitive environment. \nOperational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, controls, people (e.g., human error or misconduct) or systems (e.g., technology problems), business continuity or external events (e.g., natural disasters), compliance, reputational, regulatory, cybersecurity or legal matters and includes those risks as they relate directly to us, fraud losses attributed to applications and any associated fines and monetary penalties as a result, transaction processing, or employees, as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business. We believe operational risk is one of the most prevalent forms of risk in our risk profile. We strive to manage operational risk by establishing policies and procedures to accomplish timely and efficient processing, obtaining periodic internal control attestations from management, conducting internal process Risk Control Self-Assessments and audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls. Our operational risk, and the amount we invest in risk management, may increase as we introduce new products and product features, and as new threat actors and evolving threat vectors, such as account takeover tactics, increase and become more sophisticated. In order to be effective, among other things, our enterprise risk management capabilities must adapt and align to support any new product or loan features, capability, strategic development, or external change.\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through our information systems that may result in adverse effects on the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of our systems and data, including, but not limited to, sensitive client data. Our technology and cybersecurity teams rely on a layered system of preventive and detective technologies, controls, and policies to detect, mitigate, and contain cybersecurity threats. In addition, our cybersecurity team, and the third-party consultants they engage, assess our cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts. Cyberattacks can also result in financial and reputational risk. \nReputational risk is the risk arising from possible negative perceptions of us, whether true or not, among our current and prospective members, clients, counterparties, employees, and regulators. The potential for either enhancing or damaging our reputation is inherent in almost all aspects of business activity. We attempt to manage this risk through our commitment to a set of core values that emphasize and reward high standards of ethical behavior, maintaining a culture of compliance, and by being responsive to member and regulatory requirements.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nRisk, including, but not limited to, the risks outlined above, is inherent in our business, and therefore, despite our efforts to manage risk, there can be no assurance that we will not sustain unexpected losses. We could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted to the extent our business model, operational processes, control functions, technological capabilities, risk analyses, and business/product knowledge do not adequately identify and manage potential risks associated with our strategic initiatives. There also may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated, including when processes are changed or new products and services are introduced. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses or be otherwise adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nIncorrect estimates or assumptions by management in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements or forecasts could adversely affect our reported or forecasted assets, liabilities, income, revenues or expenses. \nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenues or expenses during the reporting periods. Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management could adversely affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If we make incorrect assumptions or estimates, our reported financial results may be over- or understated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nIn addition, operating results are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on a number of factors, including the competition we face, and our ability to attract and retain members and enterprise partnerships, and macroeconomic risks, while generating sustained revenues through the Financial Services Productivity Loop. Additionally, our business may be affected by reductions in consumer borrowing, spending and investing, consumer deposits or investment by technology platform clients from time to time as a result of a number of factors, including the state of the overall economy, which may be difficult to predict. This may result in decreased revenue levels, and we may be unable to adopt measures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in income. This inability could cause our operating results in a given quarter to be higher or lower than expected. These factors make creating accurate forecasts and budgets challenging and, as a result, we may fall materially short of our forecasts and expectations, which could cause our stock price to decline and investors to lose confidence in us. \nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe typically release earnings guidance in our quarterly and annual earnings conference calls and quarterly and annual earnings releases, and may, from time to time, announce guidance otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management’s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance includes forward-looking statements based on projections prepared by our management. Projections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that are based on information known when they are issued, and, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies relating to our business, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. \nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual outcomes. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock. \nInformation Technology and Data RisksCyberattacks and other security incidents and compromises could have an adverse effect on our business, harm our reputation and expose us to liability and adversely affect our ability to collect payments and maintain accurate accounts. Efforts to prevent and respond to these attacks and incidents are costly.\nIn the normal course of business, we collect, process and retain non-public and confidential information regarding our members, prospective members, technology platform clients and the customers of our technology platform clients. We also have arrangements in place with certain third-party service providers that require us to share consumer information. \nWe likely will not be able to anticipate or prevent all security incidents or compromises even if we have implemented preventive measures, in which case there would be an increased risk of fraud or identity theft, and we have in the past and may \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nin the future experience losses on, or delays in the collection of amounts owed. Although we devote significant resources and management focus to work to ensure the integrity of our systems through information/cybersecurity and business continuity programs, our facilities and systems, and those of third-party service providers, have been and will likely continue to be targeted by external or internal threats.\nWe and our third-party service providers are at constant risk of cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions via viruses, worms, break-ins, malware, ransomware and other malicious software programs, phishing attacks, hacking, denial-of-service attacks or other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to computer systems (including from internal and external sources) that attack our products or otherwise exploit any vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party service providers, or attempt to fraudulently induce our members, prospective members, technology platform clients and the customers of our technology platform clients, third-party service providers or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our systems or data. In addition, we expect the amount and sophistication of the perpetrators of these attacks to continue to expand, which could include nation-state actors. Any such incident could lead to interruptions, delays or website outages, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable or other confidential information. \nCyberattacks continue to be prevalent and pervasive across industries, including in our industry, and such attacks on our systems and those of our third-party service providers have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Security incidents or compromises could occur from outside our company, and also from the actions of persons inside our company who may have authorized or unauthorized access to our technology systems, despite our investment in security controls. In addition, security threats may increase as a result of geopolitical events, such as in connection with escalating conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing war in Ukraine, and recent changes to the U.S. presidential administration. These events could interrupt our business or operations, result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services. Although the impact to date from these events has not had a material adverse effect on us, no assurance is given that this will continue to be the case in the future. \nCybersecurity risks in the financial services industry have increased, in part because of new technologies, artificial intelligence, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized criminals, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyberattacks and other security incidents and compromises involving the theft of non-public and confidential information, hackers have engaged in attacks that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as consumer-facing websites. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security incidents and compromises, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but there are no assurances that these mechanisms will be effective and early detection efforts may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection. Despite our investments in detection strategy and a 24/7/365 security operations center, we also may fail to detect the existence of a security incident related to the information of our members.\nThe access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us of, confidential information regarding our members, prospective members, technology platform clients and the customers of our technology platform clients, or our proprietary information, software, methodologies and business secrets could interrupt our business or operations, result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Because each loan that we originate involves, in part, our proprietary automated underwriting process, any failure of our computer systems involving our automated underwriting process and any technical or other errors contained in the software pertaining to our automated underwriting process could compromise our ability to accurately evaluate potential members, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, any failure of our computer systems could cause an interruption in operations and result in disruptions in, or reductions in the amount of, collections from the loans we make to our members. Additionally, if threat actors were able to access our secure files, they might be able to gain access to the personal information of our members, prospective members, technology platform clients and the customers of our technology platform clients. If we are unable to prevent such activity, we may be subject to significant liability, negative publicity and a material loss of members or technology platform clients, all of which may negatively affect our business. In addition, there have in the past been a number of well-publicized attacks or incidents affecting companies in the financial services industry that have heightened concern by consumers, which could also intensify regulatory focus, cause users to lose trust in the security of the industry in general and result in reduced use of our services and increased costs, all of which could also have a material adverse effect on our business. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nThe processing of personal data and implementation of new technologies could give rise to liabilities as a result of federal, state and international laws and regulations, as well as our failure to adhere to the privacy and data security practices that we articulate to our members. \nWe collect, process, store, use, share and/or transmit a large volume of personal information and other non-public data from current, past and prospective members. There are federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy, data security and the collection, use, storage, protection, sharing and/or transmission of personal information and non-public data. Additionally, many states continue to enact legislation on matters of privacy, information security, cybersecurity, data breach and data breach notification requirements. For example, as of January 1, 2020, the CCPA granted additional consumer rights with respect to data privacy in California. The CCPA was amended by a California ballot initiative, the CPRA, in November 2020. The CCPA amendments, including expanded rights for consumers and obligations for businesses, went into effect on January 1, 2023. The CCPA, among other things, entitles California residents to know how their personal information is being collected and shared, to access or request the deletion of their personal information and to opt out of the sharing of their personal information. The amended CCPA also created a new state agency, the CPPA, and vested it with full administrative power, authority and jurisdiction to implement and enforce the CCPA. Generally, personal information that we process is subject to GLBA and thereby exempt from CCPA coverage. However, the CCPA regulates other personal information that we collect and process in connection with the business. While we have made modifications to our data collection and processing practices and policies to comply with the CCPA, we cannot predict their impact on our business, operations or financial condition. \nLaws similar to the CCPA have been passed in numerous other states, a number of which will enter into force in 2025. Further, a number of other states have proposed new privacy laws, some of which would be comprehensive such as the CCPA and others which are more narrowly focused on particular types of data. Such proposed legislation, if enacted, may add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional investment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs and/or changes in business practices and policies. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the country would make our compliance obligations more complex and costly and may increase the likelihood that we may be subject to enforcement actions or otherwise incur liability for noncompliance. In addition, laws in all 50 U.S. states require businesses to provide notice to individuals if certain of their personal information has been disclosed as a result of a qualifying data breach. These various privacy and security laws may impact our business activities, including our identification of research subjects, relationships with business partners and ultimately the marketing and distribution of our products. State laws are changing rapidly and U.S. Congress may in the future enact a comprehensive federal data privacy law to which we may likely become subject.\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards apply to data privacy and security. For example, the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, various Latin American (“LATAM”) privacy laws such as Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (“LGPD”) and Argentina’s Ley de Protección de los Datos Personales (“PDPA”) impose strict requirements for the processing of personal data of individuals located, respectively, within the EEA, the UK and LATAM region. For example, under the EU GDPR, government regulators may impose temporary or definitive bans on data processing, as well as fines of up to 20 million Euros (£17.5 million in the UK) or 4% of the annual global revenue of the company, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests. Certain jurisdictions, such as the EU, Switzerland, the UK and LATAM have enacted cross-border personal data transfers laws regulating personal data flows to third countries. For example, absent appropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the EU GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA, such as the United States, which the European Commission does not consider to be providing an adequate level of personal data protection. The European Commission has issued standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU (or otherwise subject to the EU GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU. The standard contractual clauses require exporters to assess the risk of a data transfer on a case-by-case basis, including an analysis of the laws in the destination country. The UK is not subject to the European Commission’s standard contractual clauses but has published a UK-specific transfer mechanism, which enables transfers from the UK. The UK-specific mechanism, the “International Data Transfer Agreement”, requires a similar risk assessment of the transfer as the standard contractual clauses. Further, the EU and United States have adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (\"Framework\"), which entered into force on July 11, 2023. This Framework provides that the protection of personal data transferred between the EU and the United States is comparable to that offered in the EU. This provides a further avenue to ensuring transfers to the United States are carried out in line with the EU GDPR. There has been an extension to the Framework to cover UK transfers to the United States. The Framework could be challenged like its predecessor frameworks. This complexity and the additional contractual burden may increase our overall risk exposure. In addition, laws in Switzerland and LATAM similarly restrict personal data transfers outside of those jurisdictions to countries such as the United States of America that do not provide an adequate level of personal data protection. In addition to European restrictions on cross-border personal data transfers, other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nlocal personal data residency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. If we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for cross-border personal data transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from Europe or elsewhere. Inability to import personal data to the United States may significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to collaborate with parties subject to European and other data protection laws or requiring us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.\nSeparately, as the regulatory framework for machine learning technology and AI evolves, new state laws and regulations are emerging, such as the Colorado AI Act which will go into effect on February 1, 2026, and California’s AB 2013, which requires generative AI developers to post information on their websites regarding the data used to train their AI systems. It is possible that other new laws and regulations will be adopted in the near future, or that existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect our business and the ways in which we may use AI and machine learning technology, our financial condition and our results of operations, including as a result of the cost to comply with such laws or regulations. For example, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act (“AI Act”) - the world’s first comprehensive AI law - entered into force on August 1, 2024 and, with some exceptions, will begin to apply as of August 2, 2026. This legislation imposes significant obligations on providers and deployers of high-risk artificial intelligence systems, and encourages providers and deployers of artificial intelligence systems to account for EU ethical principles in their development and use of these systems. If we develop or use AI systems that are governed by the AI Act, it may necessitate ensuring higher standards of data quality, transparency, and human oversight, as well as adhering to specific ethical, accountability, and administrative requirements, some of which may increase our costs and compliance obligations. Further, potential government regulation related to AI use and ethics may also increase the cost of research and development in this area, and failure to properly remediate AI usage or ethics issues may cause public confidence in AI to be undermined, which could slow adoption of AI in our products and services.\nAny violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, including limiting our activities in certain states and/or jurisdictions, address legal claims, and sustain monetary penalties, reputational damage and/or other harms to our business. Further, in certain cases we rely on the data processing, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity practices of our third-party service providers, including with regard to maintaining the confidentiality, security and integrity of data. If we fail to manage our third-party service providers or their relevant practices, or if they fail to meet any requirements with regard to data processing, privacy, data protection or cybersecurity required by applicable legal or contractual obligations that we face (including any applicable requirements of our clients), we may be liable in certain cases. Legal obligations relating to privacy, cybersecurity and data protection may require us to manage our third-party service providers and their practices and to enter into agreements with them in certain cases. We may face difficulties in binding our third-party service providers to these agreements and otherwise managing their relevant practices, which may subject us to claims, proceedings, and liabilities.\nFurthermore, our online privacy policy and website make certain statements regarding our privacy, information security, and data security practices with regard to information collected from our members. Failure to adhere to such practices may result in regulatory scrutiny and investigation (including the potential for fines and monetary penalties), complaints by affected members, reputational damage and other harm to our business. If either we, or the third-party service providers with which we share member data, are unable to address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in additional costs and liability, damage our reputation, and harm our business. \nDisruptions in the operation of our computer systems and third-party data centers and service providers could have an adverse effect on our business. \nOur ability to deliver products and services to our members and clients, and otherwise operate our business and comply with applicable laws, depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems and third-party data centers, as well as third-party service providers. Our computer systems and third-party providers may encounter service interruptions at any time due to system or software failure or errors, employee misconfiguration of resources or misdirected communications, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health pandemics, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks or other events. For example, in September 2023, the SoFi Invest platform experienced a service interruption that resulted in some of our members being unable to view certain of their account information and unable to buy and sell securities and other financial products on our platform for a period of time. Any such events, including persistent interruptions or perceptions of such interruptions whether true or not, in our products and services could cause members to believe that our products and services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to otherwise avoid our products and services, and otherwise have a negative effect on our business and technology infrastructure (including our computer network systems), which could lead to member dissatisfaction or long-term disruption of our operations. Additionally, our insurance policies might be insufficient to \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\ncover a claim made against us by any such members affected by any disruptions, outages, or other performance or infrastructure problems.\nAdditionally, our reliance on third-party providers may mean that we will not be able to resolve operational problems internally or on a timely basis, as our operations will depend upon such third-party service providers communicating appropriately and responding swiftly to their own service disruptions through industry standard best practices in business continuity and/or disaster recovery. As a last resort, we may rely on our ability to replace a third-party service provider if it experiences difficulties that interrupt operations for a prolonged period of time or if an essential third-party service terminates. If these service arrangements are terminated for any reason without an immediately available substitute arrangement, our operations may be severely interrupted or delayed. If such interruption or delay were to continue for a substantial period of time, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. \nThe implementation of technology changes and upgrades to maintain current and integrate new systems may cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors or system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have made and expect to continue to make substantial and increasing investments in “observability”, or the monitoring of our systems, but limitations or failures in those systems may exacerbate other problems by preventing us from anticipating or quickly detecting issues. In addition, our ability to monitor third party services and service providers is limited, and so our ability to anticipate, detect, and remediate anomalies in those services is also more limited when compared to our internal systems monitoring.\nAlthough our current use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is limited, our systems and those of our partners are increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence machine learning systems, which are complex and may have errors or inadequacies that are not easily detectable. These systems may inadvertently reduce the efficiency of our systems, or may cause unintentional or unexpected outputs that are incorrect, do not match our business goals, do not comply with our policies, or otherwise are inconsistent with our brands, guiding principles and mission. Errors or breakdowns in our machine learning systems could also result in damage to our reputation, loss of members, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business.\nWe expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the financial services industry will continue to emerge and that these new technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully adopt new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become available. A failure to maintain and/or improve current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our solution to be less competitive, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our SecuritiesThe price of our common stock has fluctuated and may be volatile in the future. \nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including: \n•changes in the industry in which we operate, including public perception of such industry; \n•developments involving our competitors; \n•changes in laws and regulations affecting our business, or changes in policies with respect to student loan forgiveness; \n•changes in interest rates and inflation; \n•variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors in general; \n•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results; \n•publication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry; \n•the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC or any changes in our reputation; \n•actions by stockholders; \n•additions and departures of key personnel; \n•commencement of, or involvement in, litigation or regulatory enforcement investigations involving our company; \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n•changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt, including in connection with acquisitions; \n•any reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock, which may increase the price of our common stock;\n•volatility in capital markets and changes in the volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale; and\n•general economic and political conditions, such as the effects of recessions, interest rates, tariffs, inflation, consumer confidence and spending, public perception of the financial services industry, availability of loans and liquidity in the capital markets, local and national elections, corruption, political instability and acts of war or terrorism, including escalating conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing war in Ukraine, and policy- and regulatory-related changes resulting from the recent changes to the U.S. presidential administration. \nThese market and industry factors, as well as others, may materially reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. \nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. \nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the further development and expansion of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on obtaining regulatory approvals, if required, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in future agreements and financing instruments, business prospects and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. \nIf analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, our stock price and trading volume could decline. \nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, as they have done in the past, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If few analysts cover us, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. Similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly. In addition, analysts may establish and publish their own periodic projections for us. These projections may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of these research analysts. In addition, if the market for technology stocks or financial services stocks or the broader stock market experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention. \nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. \nFuture resales of our common stock may cause the market price of our securities to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, have in the past and could in the future depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Sales of a substantial number of shares, or the perception that such sales may occur, could have a material and adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market could occur at any time. We have filed with the SEC, and the SEC has declared effective, a registration statement covering shares of our common stock issued in connection with the Agreement, including shares issued to the Third Party PIPE Investors, among others, to facilitate such sales and we have filed a registration statement on Form S-3 which allows us to sell securities from time to time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or increase the volatility in the market price of our common stock. \nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute our stockholders. We expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to continue granting equity awards to employees, directors, and consultants under our stock incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.\nIf Nasdaq delists our shares of common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet Nasdaq’s listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n•a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n•reduced liquidity for our securities;\n•a determination that our common stock is a “penny stock,” which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n•a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n•a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nDelaware law and our organizational documents contain certain provisions, including anti-takeover provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to take certain actions and could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nThe General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) and our organizational documents contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and therefore depress the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to take certain actions, including electing directors who are not nominated by the current members of our Board of Directors or taking other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. Among other things, our organizational documents include provisions regarding:\n•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock, including “blank check” preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n•the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n•limitations on the liability of our directors, and the indemnification of our directors and officers;\n•the ability of our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws, which may allow our Board of Directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend our bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n•advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our Board of Directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting, which could preclude stockholders from bringing matters before annual or special meetings of stockholders and delay changes in our Board of Directors and also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company. \nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in the Board of Directors or management of our company.\nSoFi Technologies, Inc.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nThe provisions of our bylaws requiring exclusive forum in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States for certain types of lawsuits may have the effect of discouraging certain lawsuits, including derivative lawsuits and lawsuits against our directors and officers, by limiting plaintiffs’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable.\nOur bylaws provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, in the event that such court does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claims for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our bylaws or Certificate of Incorporation (as either may be amended from time to time), (iv) any action asserting a claim related to or involving our company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and (v) any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL (the “Delaware Forum Provision”). The Delaware Forum Provision, however, does not apply to actions or claims arising under the Exchange Act. Our bylaws also provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternate forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, will be the United States Federal District Courts (the “Federal Forum Provision”). Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder; our stockholders cannot and will not be deemed to have waived compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision in our bylaws may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any such claims and may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert that either such provision is not enforceable or invalid. Additionally, these forum selection clauses may limit our stockholders’ ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. In addition, while the Delaware Supreme Court and other states courts have upheld the validity of federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court, there is still some uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our Federal Forum Provision. If the Federal Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States may reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders.",
