      "text": "Item 1.    Business \nPlease refer to the Glossary of Terms for definitions of defined terms and abbreviations used in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEversource Energy (Eversource), headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut, is a public utility holding company subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. We are engaged primarily in the energy delivery business through the following wholly-owned utility subsidiaries:\n•The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut;\n•NSTAR Electric Company (NSTAR Electric), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of eastern and western Massachusetts and owns solar power facilities, and its wholly-owned subsidiary Harbor Electric Energy Company (HEEC), also a regulated electric utility that distributes electric energy to its sole customer;\n•Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of New Hampshire; \n•NSTAR Gas Company (NSTAR Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Massachusetts;\n•Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts (EGMA), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Massachusetts;\n•Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut; and\n•Aquarion Company (Aquarion), a utility holding company that owns five separate regulated water utility subsidiaries and collectively serves residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection customers in parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Eversource is currently in the process of selling its Aquarion water distribution business. For further information, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Pending Sale of Aquarion\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH also serve New England customers through Eversource's electric transmission business. Along with NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas, each is doing business as Eversource Energy in its respective service territory.\nEversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each report their financial results separately. We also include information in this report on a segment basis for Eversource. Eversource has four reportable segments: electric distribution, electric transmission, natural gas distribution and water distribution. These segments represent substantially all of Eversource's total consolidated revenues. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH do not report separate business segments. \nEversource’s previous offshore wind business included 50 percent ownership interests in each of North East Offshore and South Fork Class B Member, LLC. In the third quarter of 2024, Eversource sold its interest in these entities, and in doing so, sold its interests in the Revolution Wind project, the South Fork Wind project, and the Sunrise Wind project. Eversource’s current offshore wind business is now comprised only of a noncontrolling tax equity investment in South Fork Wind. For more information, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Offshore Wind Business\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT\nEversource's electric distribution segment consists of the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, which are engaged in the distribution of electricity to retail customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively, and the solar power facilities of NSTAR Electric.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – CONNECTICUT – THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY\nCL&P's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers. As of December 31, 2024, CL&P furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.30 million customers in 157 cities and towns in Connecticut. CL&P does not own any electric generation facilities.\nRates\nCL&P is subject to regulation by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA), which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities. CL&P's present general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services. \nUnder Connecticut law, all of CL&P's customers are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while CL&P remains their electric distribution company. For those customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier, CL&P purchases power on behalf of, and passes the related cost without mark-up through to, those customers under standard service (SS) rates for customers with less than 500 kilowatts of demand (residential customers and small and medium commercial and industrial customers), and supplier of last resort service (LRS) rates for customers with 500 kilowatts or more of demand (larger commercial and industrial customers). CL&P charges customers only the amount that it pays generators for producing electricity and does not earn a profit on the cost of electricity.\nCL&P's retail rates include an energy supply component and a delivery service component, which includes distribution, transmission, conservation, renewable energy programs and other public benefit charges that are assessed on all customers. The rates established by PURA for CL&P, which are grouped by the customer bill components, are comprised of the following:\nSupply: Cost of electricity from suppliers based on competitive procurements.\n•An electric generation service charge, which recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers. The generation service charge is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nLocal Delivery: Cost to build, maintain, repair and operate the distribution grid, including the poles, lines, and meters that deliver power from the substation. It also includes the cost of resiliency and reliability improvements.\n•A distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers, as well as ongoing operating costs to maintain the infrastructure. \n•A revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by PURA. \n•An Electric System Improvements (ESI) charge, which collects the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers above the level recovered through the distribution charge. The ESI also recovers costs associated with CL&P’s system resiliency program. The ESI is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers. In 2023, the state of Connecticut enacted a law that prohibits CL&P’s ESI capital tracking mechanism from being reauthorized in the next general distribution proceeding. The ESI will therefore remain in place until base distribution rates are adjusted in CL&P’s next general distribution rate proceeding.\n•A Competitive Transition Assessment (CTA) charge, assessed to recover stranded costs associated with electric industry restructuring such as various IPP contracts. The CTA is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nPublic Benefits: Cost to support energy programs mandated by the state and federal government for financial assistance and energy efficiency programs, purchasing renewable and carbon-free electricity, and funding solar and electric vehicle incentives.\n•A Federally Mandated Congestion Charge (FMCC), which recovers any costs imposed by the FERC as part of the New England Standard Market Design, including locational marginal pricing, locational installed capacity payments, any costs approved by PURA to reduce these charges, as well as other costs approved by PURA. These costs include costs associated with ISO-NE, costs to avoid congestion on the transmission system, purchase contracts with zero-carbon energy generators (including the Millstone and Seabrook nuclear contracts) and with renewable energy generators, costs for capacity and gas peaker plants, renewable energy credits, and other initiatives required by state law. The non-bypassable component of the FMCC is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers. CL&P is required by regulation to purchase electric generation from Millstone and Seabrook under PURA-approved PPAs entered into in 2019. CL&P does not have legislative authority to use this purchased output to serve its customer load and therefore sells the energy into the wholesale market and uses the proceeds from the energy sales to offset the contract costs. The net cost or net sales amount is recovered from, or refunded to, customers in the non-bypassable component of the FMCC rate with no company profit. \n•A Systems Benefits Charge (SBC), established to fund expenses associated with various hardship and low-income programs. The SBC is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers. \n•A Renewable Energy Investment Charge, which is used to promote investment in renewable energy sources. Amounts collected by this charge are deposited into the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund and administered by the Connecticut Green Bank. \n•A Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) charge established to implement cost-effective energy conservation programs and market transformation initiatives. The CAM charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers through an approved adjustment to the following year’s energy conservation spending plan budget.\nTransmission:  Cost to maintain high voltage towers and lines, including building, maintaining and operating the regional transmission system that brings electricity from power generators to the local distribution system.\n•A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market. The transmission charge is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nDistribution Rate Case and Settlement Agreement: CL&P's distribution rates were established in an April 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective May 1, 2018, and incremental step adjustments effective May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2020. In accordance with a 2021 settlement agreement, CL&P agreed that its current base distribution rates would be frozen, subject to certain customer credits, until no earlier than January 1, 2024. The rate freeze applied only to base distribution rates (including storm costs) and not to other rate mechanisms such as the retail rate components, rate reconciling mechanisms, formula rates and any other adjustment mechanisms. The rate freeze also did not apply to any cost recovery mechanism outside of the base distribution rates with regard to grid-modernization initiatives or any other proceedings that were either pending or that could be initiated during the rate freeze period, that could have placed additional obligations on CL&P. The approval of the settlement agreement satisfied the Connecticut statute of rate review requirements that requires electric utilities to file a distribution rate case within four years of the last rate case.\nCL&P Performance Based Rate Making: PURA currently has an open proceeding to evaluate and eventually implement performance based regulation (PBR) for electric distribution companies. For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Connecticut\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSources and Availability of Electric Power Supply\nAs noted above, CL&P does not own any generation assets and purchases energy supply to serve its SS and LRS loads from a variety of competitive sources through requests for proposals. During 2024, CL&P supplied approximately 45 percent of its customer load at SS or LRS rates while the other 55 percent of its customer load had migrated to competitive energy suppliers. In terms of the total number of CL&P customers, this equates to 21 percent being on competitive supply, while 79 percent remain with SS or LRS. Because customer migration is limited to energy supply service, it has no impact on CL&P's electric distribution business or its operating income.\nAs approved by PURA, CL&P periodically enters into full requirements supply contracts for SS loads for periods of up to one year. CL&P typically enters into full requirements supply contracts for LRS loads every three months. If CL&P does not obtain full requirements supply contracts for 100 percent of the customer load for any period, it is authorized by PURA to meet the remaining load obligations directly through the ISO-NE wholesale markets. Currently, CL&P has full requirements supply contracts in place for 100 percent of its SS load for the first half of 2025. For the second half of 2025, CL&P has 50 percent of its SS load under full requirements supply contracts and intends to purchase an additional 50 percent of full requirements. None of the SS load for 2026 has been procured. CL&P obtained a full requirements supply contract for its LRS load through March 2025 and intends to purchase 100 percent of full requirements for LRS for the remainder of 2025. CL&P is prepared to self-manage the LRS load if unable to obtain full requirements supply contracts for LRS.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – MASSACHUSETTS – NSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY\nNSTAR Electric's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers. As of December 31, 2024, NSTAR Electric furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.58 million customers in 159 cities and towns in eastern and western Massachusetts, including Boston, Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and the greater Springfield metropolitan area.\nNSTAR Electric does not own any generating facilities that are used to supply customers, and purchases its energy requirements from competitive energy suppliers. NSTAR Electric owns, operates and maintains a total of 70 MW of solar power facilities on twenty-two sites in Massachusetts. NSTAR Electric sells energy from these facilities into the ISO-NE market, with proceeds credited to customers.\nRates\nNSTAR Electric is subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU), which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, acquisition of securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities. The present general rate structure for NSTAR Electric consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services.\nUnder Massachusetts law, all customers of NSTAR Electric are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while NSTAR Electric remains their electric distribution company. For those customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier, NSTAR Electric purchases power from competitive suppliers on behalf of, and passes the related cost without mark-up through to, those customers (basic service). Electric distribution companies in Massachusetts are required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through basic service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier. NSTAR Electric charges customers only the amount that it pays generators for producing electricity and does not earn a profit on the cost of electricity. \nNSTAR Electric's retail rates include a supply component and a delivery component, which include distribution, transmission, renewable energy programs and other public policy charges that are assessed on all customers. The rates established by the DPU for NSTAR Electric, which are grouped by the customer bill components, are comprised of the following:\nSupply: Cost of electricity from suppliers based on competitive procurements. \n•A basic service charge that represents the collection of energy costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers, including costs related to charge-offs of uncollectible energy costs from customers. Basic service rates are reset every six months (every three months for large commercial and industrial customers). Additionally, the DPU has authorized NSTAR Electric to recover the cost of its NSTAR Green wind contracts through the basic service charge. Basic service costs are reconciled annually, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nDelivery: Cost of grid maintenance and other critical customer services and also includes government-mandated charges.\n•A distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the distribution infrastructure to deliver electricity to its destination, as well as ongoing operating costs.\n•A revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the DPU. Annual base distribution amounts are adjusted for inflation and certain other items and filed for approval by the DPU on an annual basis, until the next rate case.\n•A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market. The transmission charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•A transition charge that represents costs to be collected primarily from previously held investments in generating plants, costs related to existing above-market power contracts, and contract costs related to long-term power contract buy-outs. The transition charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•A renewable energy charge that represents a legislatively-mandated charge to support the Massachusetts Renewable Energy Trust Fund. \n•An energy efficiency charge that represents a legislatively-mandated charge to collect costs for energy efficiency programs. The energy efficiency charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•Reconciling adjustment charges that recover certain DPU-approved costs, including pension and PBOP benefits, low income customer discounts, credits issued to net metering facilities installed by customers, payments to solar facilities qualified under the state solar renewable energy target program, attorney general consultant expenses, long-term renewable contracts, company-owned solar facilities, vegetation management costs, storm restoration, credits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, grid modernization costs, advanced metering infrastructure costs, electric vehicle make-ready infrastructure costs, and provisional system planning charges. These charges are reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers. \nDistribution Rate Case: NSTAR Electric distribution rates were established in a November 2022 DPU-approved rate case, with rates effective January 1, 2023. The DPU approved a renewal of the PBR plan originally authorized in its last rate case for a five-year term, with a corresponding stay out provision. The PBR plan term has the possibility of a five-year extension. The PBR mechanism allows for an annual adjustment to base distribution rates for inflation, exogenous events and future capital additions based on a historical five-year average of total capital additions. For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nService Quality Metrics: NSTAR Electric is subject to service quality (SQ) metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service, and could be required to pay to customers a SQ charge of up to 2.5 percent of annual transmission and distribution revenues for failing to meet such metrics. NSTAR Electric will not be required to pay a SQ charge for its 2024 performance as the company achieved results at or above target for all of its SQ metrics in 2024.\nSources and Availability of Electric Power Supply\nAs noted above, NSTAR Electric does not own generation assets (other than 70 MW of solar power facilities that produce energy that is sold into the ISO-NE market) and purchases its energy supply requirements from a variety of competitive sources through requests for proposals issued periodically, consistent with DPU regulations. As approved by the DPU, NSTAR Electric enters into supply contracts for basic service for approximately 26 percent of its residential and 14 percent of its small commercial and industrial (C&I) customers twice per year for twelve-month terms. NSTAR Electric enters into supply contracts for basic service for three percent of its large C&I customers every three months. \nDuring 2024, NSTAR Electric supplied approximately 14 percent of its overall customer load at basic service rates. The remaining 86 percent of its overall customer load was served either by municipal aggregation or competitive supply. Because customer migration is limited to energy supply service, it has no impact on NSTAR Electric’s electric distribution business or its operating income.\nELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – NEW HAMPSHIRE – PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\nPSNH's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers. As of December 31, 2024, PSNH furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 544,000 retail customers in 206 cities and towns in New Hampshire. PSNH does not own any electric generation facilities.\nRates\nPSNH is subject to regulation by the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC), which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.\nUnder New Hampshire law, all of PSNH's customers are entitled to choose competitive energy suppliers. For those customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier, PSNH purchases power on behalf of, and passes the related cost without mark-up through to, those customers (default energy service). PSNH charges customers only the amount that it pays generators for producing electricity and does not earn a profit on the cost of electricity.\nPSNH's retail rates include a supply component and a delivery component, which include distribution, transmission, renewable energy programs and other public policy charges that are assessed on all customers. The rates established by the NHPUC for PSNH, which are grouped by the customer bill components, are comprised of the following:\nSupply: Cost of electricity from suppliers based on competitive procurements. \n•A default energy service charge recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers. The default energy service charge changes semi-annually, and is reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NHPUC, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nDelivery: Cost of building, maintaining and operating distribution and transmission systems, as well as state and federally mandated charges that fund financial assistance, energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.\n•A distribution charge, which includes kilowatt-hour and/or demand-based charges to recover costs related to the maintenance and operation of PSNH's infrastructure to deliver power to its destination, as well as power restoration and service costs. It also includes a customer charge to collect the cost of providing service to a customer; such as the installation, maintenance, reading and replacement of meters and maintaining accounts and records. \n•A Transmission Charge Adjustment Mechanism (TCAM) that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market. The transmission charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the NHPUC, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers. \n•A Stranded Cost Recovery Charge (SCRC), which allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs, including above-market expenses incurred under mandated power purchase obligations, recovery of costs of the net metering credit program, a credit for revenues generated by the RGGI program, other long-term investments and obligations, and the remaining costs associated with the 2018 sales of its generation facilities. The SCRC rate changes annually with the option to change semi-annually, and is reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NHPUC, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•A Systems Benefits Charge (SBC), which funds energy efficiency programs for all customers, as well as assistance programs for residential customers within certain income guidelines. The SBC also has a component for the company to collect lost base revenue (LBR) from the implementation of energy efficiency measures. LBR will remain a component of the SBC charge unless and until PSNH has a decoupling or other revenue adjustment mechanism approved by the NHPUC. The SBC rate changes annually and is reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NHPUC, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•A Regulatory Reconciliation Adjustment (RRA) that reconciles the difference between certain estimated and actual costs included in base distribution rates, including costs related to regulatory assessments, vegetation management program expenses, property tax expenses, storm cost amortization updated for the actual cost of long-term debt and lost base revenues related to net metering.\n•A Pole Plant Adjustment Mechanism (PPAM) that recovers certain costs associated with poles acquired under a 2023 purchase agreement between PSNH and Consolidated Communications, including the operation and maintenance of poles, pole inspections, and vegetation management expenses incurred, beginning February 10, 2021 through April 30, 2023.\nDistribution Rate Case and Settlement Agreement: PSNH's distribution rates were established in a 2020 NHPUC-approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective January 1, 2021. PSNH was permitted three step increases, effective January 1, 2021, August 1, 2021, and November 1, 2022 to reflect plant additions in calendar years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nOn June 11, 2024, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for approval of a temporary annual base distribution rate increase effective August 1, 2024, which was approved by the NHPUC on July 31, 2024. Also on June 11, 2024, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC to request an increase in permanent base distribution rates, proposed to take effect August 1, 2025. A decision by the NHPUC on permanent rates is expected by August 1, 2025. For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - New Hampshire\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nSources and Availability of Electric Power Supply\nPSNH does not own any generation assets and as approved by the NHPUC, purchases energy supply from a variety of competitive suppliers for its energy service customers through requests for proposals issued twice per year, for six-month terms, for approximately 58 percent of its residential and small C&I customers and for 15 percent of its large C&I customers. As required by the NHPUC, PSNH purchased 12.5 percent of its residential and small C&I customer load through direct wholesale market participation for the second half of 2024.\nDuring 2024, PSNH supplied approximately 58 percent of its customer load at default energy service rates while the other 42 percent of its customer load had migrated to competitive energy suppliers. Because customer migration is limited to energy supply service, it has no impact on PSNH’s electric distribution business or its operating income.\nELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each own and maintain transmission facilities that are part of an interstate power transmission grid over which electricity is transmitted throughout New England. Each of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, and most other New England utilities, are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's transmission facilities and the rules by which they acquire transmission services. Under these arrangements, ISO-NE, a non-profit corporation whose board of directors and staff are independent of all market participants, serves as the regional transmission organization of the New England transmission system. \nWholesale Transmission Rates and Transmission Proceedings\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH wholesale transmission rates are calculated in accordance with a FERC-approved formula ratemaking framework and each utility is required to file an annual update on or before July 31st with resulting rates effective January 1st the following year. The formula rate framework provides for an annual reconciliation of the prior calendar year actual costs incurred related to our transmission facilities, including an allowed ROE, plus forecasted information through the next rate period. The financial impacts of differences between actual and estimated costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, transmission wholesale customers. The annual update process also includes formula rate protocols that provide disclosure of cost inputs, an opportunity for informal discovery procedures and a challenge process, which provides transparency to stakeholders. The transmission rates are collected from New England wholesale customers, including distribution customers of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH. \nFrom time to time, various matters are pending before FERC relating to transmission rates, incentives, interconnections and transmission planning. Depending on the outcome, any of these matters could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. At this time, Eversource cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the matters currently pending before FERC, and the resulting impact on its transmission incentives or planning.\nTransmission Rate Base\nTransmission rate base under our FERC-approved tariff primarily consists of our investment in transmission net utility plant less accumulated deferred income taxes. Under our FERC-approved tariff, investments in net utility plant generally enter rate base after they are placed in commercial operation. At the end of 2024, our estimated transmission rate base was approximately $10.8 billion, including approximately $4.4 billion at CL&P, $4.4 billion at NSTAR Electric, and $2.0 billion at PSNH.\nFERC ROE Complaints\nFour separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively, the Complainants). In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of 11.14 percent that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate 15-month complaint periods. In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of 10.57 percent and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of 11.74 percent, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable. \nIn response to appeals of the FERC decision in the first complaint filed by the NETOs and the Complainants, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court) issued a decision on April 14, 2017 vacating and remanding the FERC's decision. On October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court. FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE. \nDuring 2019 and 2020, FERC also issued multiple decisions in two pending transmission ROE complaints against the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) transmission owners, in which FERC adopted new methodologies for determining base ROEs. On August 9, 2022, the Court issued a decision vacating these MISO FERC decisions and remanded to FERC to reopen the proceedings. On October 17, 2024, FERC issued an order on the remand of the MISO ROE proceedings. On February 4, 2025, the MISO transmission owners submitted a petition for review with the Court requesting review of the October 17, 2024 MISO ROE order on remand and a December 19, 2024 notice of denial of rehearing. \nOn November 13, 2024, the NETOs filed a supplemental brief in their four pending ROE proceedings to explain to FERC that it cannot apply the reasoning and methodologies of the MISO ROE case to the NETOs’ cases due to the entirely different set of facts in the MISO and NETOs ROE proceedings. Doing so would violate the substance of the Court’s April 14, 2017 order and would violate the legal standard required by the Federal Power Act. \nGiven the significant uncertainty regarding the applicability of the FERC order in the MISO transmission owners’ two complaint cases to the NETOs’ pending four complaint cases due to the complex differences between the cases, Eversource concluded that there is no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaints or subsequent periods at this time and Eversource cannot reasonably estimate any potential range of loss for any of the four complaint proceedings at this time. The resolution of these proceedings could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For further information, see \"FERC Regulatory Matters - FERC ROE Complaints\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nNATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT\nNSTAR Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 315,000 customers in 59 communities in central and eastern Massachusetts. EGMA distributes natural gas to approximately 332,000 customers in 66 communities throughout Massachusetts. Yankee Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 254,000 customers in 85 cities and towns in Connecticut. Our natural gas businesses provide firm natural gas sales and transportation service to eligible retail customers who require a continuous natural gas supply throughout the year, such as residential customers who rely on natural gas for heating, hot water and cooking needs, as well as commercial and industrial customers who rely on natural gas for space heating, hot water, cooking and commercial and industrial applications. Total throughput (sales and transportation) in 2024 was approximately 69.0 Bcf for NSTAR Gas, 54.8 Bcf for EGMA, and 59.5 Bcf for Yankee Gas. \nNSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas generate revenues primarily through the sale and/or transportation of natural gas. All NSTAR Gas and EGMA retail customers have the ability to choose to purchase gas from third party marketers under the Massachusetts Retail Choice program. In the past year in Massachusetts, Retail Choice represented only approximately one percent of the total residential load, while Retail Choice represented approximately 40 percent of the total commercial and industrial load. Retail natural gas service in Connecticut is partially unbundled: residential customers in Yankee Gas' service territory buy natural gas supply and delivery only from Yankee Gas while commercial and industrial customers may choose their natural gas suppliers. For customers who purchase natural gas from NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas, the purchased natural gas commodity cost is passed through to those customers without mark-up. NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas do not earn a profit on the cost of purchased gas. \nFirm transportation service is offered to customers who purchase natural gas from sources other than NSTAR Gas, EGMA or Yankee Gas. NSTAR Gas and EGMA have the ability to offer interruptible transportation and interruptible natural gas sales service to high volume commercial and industrial customers. Yankee Gas offers interruptible transportation and interruptible natural gas sales service to commercial and industrial customers who have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel on short notice. NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas can interrupt service to these customers during peak demand periods or at any other time to maintain distribution system integrity. \nA portion of the storage of natural gas supply for NSTAR Gas and EGMA during the winter heating season is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource. NSTAR Gas has access to facilities consisting of an LNG liquefaction and vaporization plant and three above-ground cryogenic storage tanks having an aggregate capacity of 3.0 Bcf of liquefied natural gas and facilities that include additional storage capacity of 0.5 Bcf. Total vaporization capacity of these facilities is 0.21 Bcf per day. EGMA has access to approximately 1.7 Bcf of LNG and 0.1 Bcf of LPG storage, with a total vaporization capacity of 0.15 Bcf per day. Yankee Gas owns a 1.2 Bcf LNG facility, which also has the ability to liquefy and vaporize up to 0.1 Bcf per day. This facility is used primarily to assist Yankee Gas in meeting its supplier-of-last-resort obligations and also enables it to provide economic supply and make economic refill of natural gas, typically during periods of low demand.\nRates\nNSTAR Gas and EGMA are subject to regulation by the DPU and Yankee Gas is subject to regulation by the PURA, both of which, among other things, have jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.\nRetail natural gas supply and delivery rates are established by the DPU and the PURA and are comprised of:\n•A seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause (CGAC) at NSTAR Gas and EGMA that collects natural gas supply costs, pipeline and storage capacity costs, costs related to charge-offs of uncollected energy costs and working capital related costs. The CGAC is reset semi-annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following corresponding season. In addition, NSTAR Gas and EGMA file interim changes to the CGAC factor when the actual costs of natural gas supply vary from projections by more than five percent.\n•A Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause at Yankee Gas that collects the costs of the procurement of natural gas for its firm and seasonal customers. The PGA is evaluated monthly.  Differences between actual natural gas costs and collection amounts from September 1st through August 31st of each PGA year are deferred and then recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following PGA year. Carrying charges on outstanding balances are calculated using Yankee Gas' weighted average cost of capital in accordance with the directives of the PURA.\n•A distribution charge consisting of a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge that collects the costs of building, maintaining, and expanding the natural gas infrastructure to deliver natural gas supply to its customers. This also includes collection of ongoing operating costs.\n•A local distribution adjustment clause (LDAC) at NSTAR Gas and EGMA that collects all energy efficiency and related program costs, environmental costs, pension and PBOP related costs, attorney general consultant costs, credits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, gas system enhancement program (GSEP) costs, costs associated with low income customers, and costs associated with a geothermal pilot program. The LDAC is reset annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following period and provides for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers.\n•A Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) at Yankee Gas, which allows 100 percent recovery of conservation costs through this mechanism including program incentives to promote energy efficiency. A reconciliation of CAM revenues to expenses is performed annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers with carrying charges during the following year.\n•A Gas System Improvement (GSI) reconciliation mechanism at Yankee Gas, which collects the costs of certain Distribution Integrity Management Program (DIMP) and core capital plant in service above and beyond the level that is recovered through the distribution charge. The GSI is adjusted and reconciled annually, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\n•A System Expansion Rate (SER) reconciliation mechanism at Yankee Gas, which compares distribution system expansion investment costs and revenues from system expansion customers with the level projected in current distribution customer rates.  This reconciliation is performed annually and customer rates are adjusted accordingly.\n•A Revenue Decoupling Mechanism (RDM) at NSTAR Gas and EGMA that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the DPU. The pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement is also subject to adjustment in accordance with provisions of the November 2020 NSTAR Gas distribution rate case and the October 2020 EGMA rate settlement agreement.\n•A RDM at Yankee Gas that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the PURA. The pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement is also subject to adjustment in accordance with provisions of the 2018 rate case settlement agreement.\nDistribution Rate Cases and Settlement Agreements: \nNSTAR Gas: NSTAR Gas distribution rates were established in an October 2020 DPU-approved rate case, with rates effective November 1, 2020. The DPU also approved a 10-year PBR plan through November 1, 2030, which includes inflation-based adjustments to annual base distribution amounts effective annually beginning November 1, 2021. For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nEGMA: EGMA’s distribution rates were established in a DPU-approved October 7, 2020 rate settlement agreement, with rate increases on November 1, 2021 and November 1, 2022, and two rate base resets during an eight-year rate plan. The first rate base reset occurred on November 1, 2024 and the second will occur November 1, 2027. Notwithstanding the two distribution rate increases, the two rate base reset provisions, and potential adjustments for qualifying exogenous events, EGMA agreed not to file for an increase or redesign of distribution base rates effective prior to November 1, 2028. For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYankee Gas: Yankee Gas distribution rates were established in a December 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement, with rates effective November 15, 2018. PURA also approved step adjustments effective January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021. On November 12, 2024, Yankee Gas filed an application to amend its base distribution rates for effect on November 1, 2025. A final decision by PURA is expected in October 2025. For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Connecticut\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nService Quality Metrics: NSTAR Gas and EGMA are subject to SQ metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service and each could be required to pay to customers a SQ charge of up to 2.5 percent of annual distribution revenues for failing to meet such metrics. NSTAR Gas and EGMA will not be required to pay any SQ charges relating to their 2024 performance.\nNatural Gas Replacement\nMassachusetts: Pursuant to Massachusetts legislation, in October of each year, NSTAR Gas and EGMA file GSEP Plans with the DPU for the following construction year. The GSEP Program is designed to accelerate the replacement of certain natural gas distribution facilities in the system to less than 25 years. The GSEP includes a tariff that provides NSTAR Gas and EGMA an opportunity to collect the costs for the program on an annual basis through a reconciling factor. On April 30th each year, the DPU approves the GSEP rate recovery factor that goes into effect on May 1st.\nIn October 2020, the DPU opened Docket “DPU 20-80 The Future of Gas” to examine the role of Massachusetts natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs) in helping to meet the state’s 2050 climate goals. For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nConnecticut: Yankee Gas' December 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement included an accelerated pipeline replacement cost recovery program. The GSI rate recovers accelerated pipeline replacement as well as other capital investment through an annual reconciliation. Yankee Gas files its GSI reconciliation annually on March 1st for rates effective April 1st.\nSources and Availability of Natural Gas Supply\nNSTAR Gas and EGMA maintain flexible resource portfolios consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, market area storage and peaking services. NSTAR Gas and EGMA purchase transportation, storage, and balancing services from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, as well as other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions in the U.S., including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent region, and Appalachian Shale (as well as Ontario, Canada specific to EGMA), which supply to the final delivery points in the NSTAR Gas and EGMA service areas. NSTAR Gas purchases all of its natural gas supply under a firm, competitively bid annual portfolio management contract. EGMA purchases the majority of its natural gas supply under a number of firm, competitively bid annual portfolio management contracts, and manages a portion of its own portfolio. In addition to the firm transportation and natural gas storage supplies discussed above, NSTAR Gas and EGMA utilize on-system LNG facilities (and also LPG facilities for EGMA) to meet winter peaking demands. These LNG facilities are located within NSTAR Gas' and EGMA’s distribution systems and are used to liquefy pipeline natural gas and/or receive liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas to be stored during the warmer months for vaporization and use during the heating season. During the summer injection season, excess pipeline capacity and supplies are used to deliver and store natural gas in market area underground storage facilities located in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Stored natural gas is withdrawn during the winter season to supplement flowing pipeline supplies in order to meet firm heating demand. NSTAR Gas has firm underground storage contracts and total storage capacity entitlements of approximately 6.6 Bcf, and 3.5 Bcf LNG storage is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp. in facilities located in two different locations in Massachusetts. EGMA has firm underground storage contracts and total storage capacity entitlements of approximately 8.8 Bcf, and 1.8 Bcf LNG and LPG storage is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp. in facilities located at seven different locations in Massachusetts.\nPURA requires Yankee Gas to meet the needs of its firm customers under all weather conditions. Specifically, Yankee Gas must structure its supply portfolio to meet firm customer needs under a design day scenario (defined as the coldest day in 30 years) and under a design year scenario (defined as the average of the four coldest years in the last 30 years). Yankee Gas also maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, off-system storage and its on-system 1.2 Bcf LNG storage facility in Connecticut to meet consumption needs during the coldest days of winter. Yankee Gas obtains its interstate capacity from the three interstate pipelines that directly serve Connecticut: the Algonquin, Tennessee and Iroquois Pipelines, which connect to other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions, including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent, Canadian regions and Appalachian Shale supplies. \nBased on information currently available regarding projected growth in demand and estimates of availability of future supplies of pipeline natural gas, each of NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Yankee Gas believes that in order to meet the long-term firm customer requirements in a reliable manner, a combination of pipeline, storage, and non-pipeline solutions will be necessary.\nWATER DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT\nAquarion Company (Aquarion) operates five separate regulated water utilities in Connecticut (Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, or AWC-CT, and The Torrington Water Company), Massachusetts (Aquarion Water Company of Massachusetts, or AWC-MA), and New Hampshire (Aquarion Water Company of New Hampshire, or AWC-NH, and Abenaki Water Company). These regulated companies provide water services to approximately 248,000 residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and fire protection and other customers, in 73 towns and cities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 91 percent of Aquarion’s customers were based in Connecticut.\nRates\nAquarion's water utilities are subject to regulation by the PURA, the DPU and the NHPUC in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively. These regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over, among other things, rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.\nAquarion’s general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection services.\nThe rates established by the PURA, DPU and NHPUC are comprised of the following:\n•A base rate, which is comprised of fixed charges based on meter/fire connection sizes, as well as volumetric charges based on the amount of water sold. Together these charges are designed to recover the full cost of service resulting from a general rate proceeding.\n•In Connecticut, a revenue adjustment mechanism (RAM) that reconciles earned revenues, with certain allowed adjustments, on an annual basis, to the revenue requirement approved by PURA.\n•In Connecticut and New Hampshire, a water infrastructure conservation adjustment (WICA) charge, and in Massachusetts, an annual main replacement adjustment mechanism (MRAM) charge, which is applied between rate case proceedings and seeks recovery of allowed costs associated with eligible infrastructure improvement projects placed in-service. The WICA is updated semi-annually in Connecticut and annually in New Hampshire. In Connecticut, an annual WICA reconciliation mechanism reconciles earned WICA revenue to the approved WICA revenue with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.\nDistribution Rate Cases: On August 29, 2022, Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut (AWC-CT) filed an application with PURA to amend its existing rate schedules. On March 15, 2023, PURA issued a final decision that rejected AWC-CT’s application with PURA, which was subsequently appealed by AWC-CT. On March 25, 2024, the State of Connecticut Superior Court issued a decision on the appeal and on March 28, 2024, AWC-CT filed an appeal of the Connecticut Superior Court decision. On July 31, 2024, PURA issued a final decision and increased AWC-CT’s approved revenue requirement by $0.1 million above the amount authorized in the March 15, 2023 decision, which was also subsequently appealed by AWC-CT. Both appeals are pending. For further information, see \"Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Connecticut\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAquarion’s Massachusetts base distribution rates were established in a 2018 DPU-approved rate case. Aquarion's New Hampshire base distribution rates were established in a July 2022 NHPUC-approved rate case settlement agreement, with a single step adjustment approved on January 19, 2023. Rates were effective March 1, 2023.\nSources and Availability of Water Supply\nOur water utilities obtain their water supplies from owned surface water sources (reservoirs) and groundwater supplies (wells) with a total supply yield of approximately 135 million gallons per day, as well as water purchased from other water suppliers. Approximately 98 percent of our annual production is self-supplied and processed at ten surface water treatment plants and numerous well stations, which are all located in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.\nThe capacities of Aquarion’s sources of supply, and water treatment, pumping and distribution facilities, are considered sufficient to meet the present requirements of Aquarion’s customers under normal conditions. On occasion, drought declarations are issued for portions of Aquarion’s service territories in response to extended periods of dry weather conditions. \nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nFor information on capital expenditures and projects during 2024, as well as projected capital expenditures by business, see \"Business Development and Capital Expenditures\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nFINANCING\nFor information regarding short-term and long-term debt agreements, see \"Liquidity\" in the accompanying Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 8, \"Short-Term Debt,\" and Note 9, \"Long-Term Debt,\" of the Combined Notes to Financial Statements.\nNUCLEAR FUEL STORAGE\nCL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and several other New England electric utilities are stockholders in three inactive regional nuclear generation companies, CYAPC, MYAPC and YAEC (collectively, the Yankee Companies). The Yankee Companies have completed the physical decommissioning of their respective nuclear power facilities and are now engaged in the long-term storage of their spent nuclear fuel. The Yankee Companies fund these costs through litigation proceeds received from the DOE and, to the extent necessary, through wholesale, FERC-approved rates charged under power purchase agreements with several New England utilities, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH. CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, in turn recover these costs from their customers through state regulatory commission-approved retail rates. The Yankee Companies collect amounts that we believe are adequate to recover the remaining plant closure and fuel storage cost estimates for the respective plants. We believe CL&P and NSTAR Electric will recover their shares of these obligations from their customers. PSNH has recovered its total share of these costs from its customers.\nWe consolidate the assets and obligations of CYAPC and YAEC on our consolidated balance sheet because our ownership and voting interests are greater than 50 percent of each of these companies. \nOTHER REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nGeneral\nWe are regulated by various federal and state agencies, including FERC, the SEC, and various state and/or local regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the industry and the service areas in which each of our companies operates, including the PURA, which has jurisdiction over CL&P, Yankee Gas, and Aquarion, the DPU, which has jurisdiction over NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, EGMA and Aquarion, and the NHPUC, which has jurisdiction over PSNH and Aquarion. \nRenewable Portfolio Standards\nEach of the states in which we do business has Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) requirements, which generally require fixed percentages of our energy supply to come from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, landfill gas, fuel cells and other similar sources.\nConnecticut's RPS statute requires increasing percentages of the electricity sold to retail customers to have direct ties to renewable sources. In 2024, the total RPS obligation was 37.0 percent and will ultimately reach 48.0 percent in 2030. CL&P is permitted to recover any costs incurred in complying with RPS from its customers through its generation service charge rate.\nMassachusetts' RPS program requires electricity suppliers to meet renewable energy standards. For 2024, the RPS and Clean Energy Standard (CES) requirements were 62.3 percent, and will ultimately reach 63.1 percent in 2025. Massachusetts electric suppliers were also required to meet Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (APS) of 6.0 percent and Clean Peak Energy Standards (CPS) of 4.0 percent in 2024. Those requirements will reach 6.25 and 5.5 percent in 2025, respectively. NSTAR Electric is permitted to recover any costs incurred in complying with these requirements from its customers through rates. NSTAR Electric also owns renewable solar power facilities. The RECs generated from NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities are sold to other energy suppliers, and the proceeds from these sales are credited back to customers.\nNew Hampshire's RPS provision requires increasing percentages of the electricity sold to retail customers to have direct ties to renewable sources. In 2024, the total RPS obligation was 24.3 percent and it will ultimately reach 25.2 percent in 2025. The costs of the RECs are recovered by PSNH through rates charged to customers.\nEnvironmental Regulation and Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental legislation and regulation with respect to water quality, air quality, natural/working lands (wetlands, water resource areas that include land that borders a body of water, plant/animal habitat), hazardous materials and other environmental matters. Our environmental policy includes formal procedures and a task-scheduling system in place to help ensure environmental compliance. The Governance, Environmental and Social Responsibility Committee of Eversource’s Board of Trustees also provides oversight of climate issues, environmental matters and compliance. We also identify and address potential environmental risks through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program in addition to rigorous audits of our facilities, vendors, and processes.\nAdditionally, projects may not be constructed or significantly modified without a review of the environmental impact of the proposed construction or modification by the applicable federal or state agencies. Many of our construction projects require the submission of comprehensive permitting applications to various local, state and federal agencies. The permits we receive outline various best management practices and restoration requirements to address construction period-impacts. \nWe have recorded a liability for what we believe, based upon currently available information, is our reasonably estimable environmental investigation, remediation, and/or natural resource damages costs for waste disposal sites for which we have probable liability. Under federal and state law, government agencies and private parties can attempt to impose liability on us for recovery of investigation and remediation costs at contaminated sites. As of December 31, 2024, the liability recorded for our reasonably estimable and probable environmental remediation costs for known sites needing investigation and/or remediation, exclusive of recoveries from insurance or from third parties, was $128.0 million, representing 65 sites. These costs could be significantly higher if additional remediation becomes necessary or when additional information as to the extent of contamination becomes available.\nThe most significant liabilities currently relate to future clean-up costs at former MGP facilities. These facilities were owned and operated by our predecessor companies from the mid-1800's to mid-1900's. By-products from the manufacture of natural gas using coal resulted in fuel oils, hydrocarbons, coal tar, purifier wastes, metals and other waste products that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment. We currently have partial or full ownership responsibilities at former MGP sites that have a reserve balance of $115.9 million of the total $128.0 million as of December 31, 2024. MGP costs are recoverable through rates charged to our customers.\nWhen planning environmental investigations and remediation of impacted properties, we work closely with the municipalities and environmental regulators to ensure that our remediation plans adhere to applicable regulations while protecting human health and the environment. In many cases, these remediation projects are designed to address opportunities for beneficial reuse of the property. \nGlobal Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emission Issues\nEversource assesses the regulatory, physical and transitional impacts related to climate change to develop mitigation strategies including evaluating the impacts of more severe and frequent weather events, financial risks, changing customer behaviors, and opportunities to reduce emissions in our operations and for the region through clean energy and emerging technologies investments.\nRegulatory Impacts of Climate Change:  Global climate change has received focus from the federal and state governments. Some of the states in which we operate have aggressive climate goals and implementation plans. In Connecticut, legislation includes a target to achieve zero-carbon electricity by 2040. In response to the 2021 Massachusetts climate legislation calling for increased electrification of the transportation and building sectors, in 2023, Eversource developed an Electric Sector Modernization Plan (ESMP) detailing steps the Company will take over the next five and ten years to help ensure reliability and resiliency while supporting a clean energy future. Approved by the DPU in 2024, the ESMP includes incremental spending for interconnections of clean energy and resiliency initiatives and corresponding cost recovery will be established in 2025. Similarly, the Massachusetts “Future of Gas” docket (DPU 20-80) specified measures for natural gas local distribution companies to support the state’s net zero by 2050 climate goal. These state regulations and related policies may introduce risks and opportunities to our businesses if demands for energy change. The prior administration had communicated a strong focus on addressing climate change by setting a U.S. target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 economy-wide. The plan called for aggressive measures focused on clean transportation, clean energy and climate investments targeted at environmental justice communities. In support of this plan, federal funding and incentive programs for clean transportation and energy have offered opportunities for Eversource to invest in projects that have the ability to reduce emissions in the region while benefiting our communities and shareholders. Under the new administration there is uncertainty about the future of this funding and other clean energy policies, and the potential impact it may have on future projects. In addition, the states we operate in may respond to the federal policy shift with enhancements to existing clean energy programs, creating additional opportunities. \nEversource continually evaluates the evolving regulatory landscape concerning climate change, which could potentially lead to additional requirements, rules and regulations that could impact how we operate our businesses. Potential future environmental statutes, regulations, policies and reporting metrics for rate cases that address climate change could impose significant additional costs and there can be no assurance that regulators will approve the recovery of those costs. \nPhysical and Transitional Impacts of Climate Change: Eversource assesses the physical impacts of climate change that are presented in the form of weather or natural events or due to longer-term shifts in climate patterns, as well as transitional impacts related to a shift to a lower-carbon economy and changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements. To address physical and transitional impacts related to climate change, maintain resiliency across our system, and enable potential opportunities for our business, we are pursuing the following actions:\n•Improving our system resiliency in response to climate change through vegetation management, pole and wire strengthening, flood proofing, and other system hardening measures; \n•Conducting climate modeling to assess vulnerable regions and infrastructure in order to prioritize hazard mitigation projects;\n•Implementing a grid modernization plan that will enhance our electric distribution infrastructure to improve resiliency and reliability and increase opportunities to facilitate integration of distributed energy resources, electric vehicle infrastructure, and electrification of building heat;\n•Focusing on improving the efficiency of our electric and natural gas distribution systems, preparing for increased opportunities that clean energy advancements create, and providing customers with ways to optimize their energy efficiency; \n•Pursuing new technologies and incentives for decarbonization of energy in the sectors that both we and our customers operate in;\n•Evaluating opportunities for our natural gas system and exploring alternative, less carbon-intensive technologies like networked geothermal for heating and cooling; and\n•Investigating emerging technologies such as energy storage and automation programs that improve reliability.\nPhysical risks from climate change may be acute due to increased severity of extreme weather events or chronic due to changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns, rising mean temperatures and/or rising sea levels and shifting weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, extreme heat, more frequent and severe storms, droughts, wildfires and floods. These risks may result in customers’ energy and water usage increasing or decreasing depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes, degradation of water quality and our ability to reliably deliver our services to customers. Severe weather may cause outages, potential disruption of operations and property damage to our assets.\nOur actions to improve system reliability and resiliency allow our business to operate under changing conditions and meet customer expectations. System improvements are designed to withstand severe weather impacts and include installing new and stronger infrastructure like poles, wires and related system equipment, as well as enhanced year-round tree trimming. We are reinforcing existing critical facilities to withstand storm surges and future substations are being “flood hardened” to better protect our system against storm surges associated with the increasing risk of severe weather in the states that support this work. We created our comprehensive emergency preparedness and response plans in partnership with state and community leaders so that when a storm occurs, we can provide customers and municipalities with timely and accurate information, while safely and promptly restoring power. Additionally, we collaborate with other utility providers and industry partners across the country to better understand storm hazards and develop solutions to improve our system reliability.\nEversource set a GHG reduction goal in 2019 to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations and reach carbon neutrality by 2030. This goal addresses emissions from our operations primarily in the form of line loss (emissions associated with the energy lost when power is transmitted and distributed across the electric system), methane leaks from our natural gas distribution system, fuel consumption from our facilities and vehicle fleet, and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) leaks from electric equipment. Initiatives to reduce GHG emissions have resulted in a 30% reduction in emission from 2018 to 2023 from initiatives including improved energy efficiency at our buildings, utilizing alternative fuels and introducing more hybrid and electric vehicles into the company fleet, reducing fugitive emissions of methane by replacing leak-prone natural gas pipes, improving maintenance of SF6 gas-insulated electrical equipment, and piloting innovative SF6-free technologies thereby reducing SF6 emissions and supporting the overall interconnection of clean energy to the region thereby helping reduce the carbon intensity of line losses across the electric grid. Progress towards this target is reported at least annually through a third-party-verified GHG emission inventory. We are also looking to introduce an expanded target that will place a greater emphasis on the indirect Scope 3 emissions from our customers’ energy use. An expanded target that aligns with the climate policies and regulations of the states where we operate will be introduced in early 2025.\nOur business is also exposed to climate-related transitional impacts, such as policy, legal and reputational impacts and technology and market changes as we enable broad decarbonization of the electrical and building sectors in support of regional policies and targets. We actively support local, state and federal emission reduction goals to address climate change and pursue climate-related opportunities that enable continued business success while serving the needs of our customers. Our investments help reduce regional emissions while improving shareholder value. Meanwhile, our energy efficiency solutions and electric vehicle infrastructure investments allow our customers to make choices that minimize climate-related impacts. \nAdditionally, as our business transitions to support a more energy diverse economy, human capital needs will also change with the potential to impact our workforce. As new technologies are implemented, we will need to recruit, develop and possibly retrain employees to meet the need for new skill sets. \nElectric and Magnetic Fields \nFor more than forty years, published reports have discussed the possibility of adverse health effects from electric and magnetic fields (EMF) associated with electric transmission and distribution facilities, including appliances, and wiring in buildings and homes. Some epidemiology studies have reported a possible statistical association between adverse health effects and exposure with EMF. The association identified in some of these studies remain unexplained and inconclusive. Numerous scientific review panels, considering all significant EMF epidemiology and laboratory studies, have concluded that the available body of scientific information does not support a conclusion that EMF affects human health at levels expected in the vicinity. In accordance with recommendations of various regulatory bodies and public health organizations, we use design principles that help reduce potential EMF exposures associated with new transmission lines.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEversource is committed to delivering reliable energy and superior customer service; expanding energy options for our region; environmental stewardship; a safe and fairly compensated workforce; and community service and leadership. Our employees are critical to achieving this mission and we recognize the importance of attracting, retaining, and developing the most qualified individuals and ensuring fairness and equal employment opportunity for all.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the matters set forth under \"Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\" included immediately prior to Item 1, Business, above, we are subject to a variety of material risks. Our susceptibility to certain risks, including those discussed in detail below, could exacerbate other risks. These risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our risk profile. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCybersecurity Threats and Attacks:\nCyberattacks, including acts of war or terrorism, targeted directly on or indirectly affecting our systems or the systems of third parties on which we rely, could severely impair operations, negatively impact our business, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and adversely affect our reputation.\nCyberattacks that seek to exploit potential vulnerabilities in the utility industry and seek to disrupt electric, natural gas and water transmission and distribution systems are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency. Various geo-political conflicts and acts of war around the world continue to result in increased cyberattacks against critical infrastructure. A successful cyberattack on the information technology systems that control our transmission, distribution, natural gas and water systems or other assets could impair or prevent us from managing these systems and facilities, operating our systems effectively, or properly managing our data, networks and programs. The breach of certain information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and to repair system damage or security breaches and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation.\nWe have instituted safeguards to protect our information technology systems and assets. We deploy substantial technologies to system and application security, encryption and other measures to protect our computer systems and infrastructure from unauthorized access or misuse. Specifically, regarding vulnerabilities, we patch systems timely where patches are available to deploy, and have technologies that detect exploits of vulnerabilities and proactively block the exploit when it happens. We also interface with numerous external entities to improve our cybersecurity situational awareness. The FERC, through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), requires certain safeguards to be implemented to deter cyberattacks. These safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyberattacks. We maintain cyber insurance to cover damages, potential ransom and defense costs related to breaches of networks or operational technology, but it may be insufficient in limits and coverage exclusions to cover all losses.\nAny such cyberattacks could result in loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFor further information, see Item 1C, Cybersecurity included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe unauthorized access to, and the misappropriation of, confidential and proprietary Company, customer, employee, financial or system operating information could adversely affect our business operations and adversely impact our reputation.\nIn the regular course of business, we, and our third-party suppliers, rely on information technology to maintain sensitive Company, customer, employee, financial and system operating information. We are required by various federal and state laws to safeguard this information. Cyber intrusions, security breaches, theft or loss of this information by cybercrime or otherwise could lead to the release of critical operating information or confidential Company, customer or employee information, which could adversely affect our business operations or adversely impact our reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation. We employ system controls to prevent the dissemination of certain confidential information and periodically train employees on phishing risks. We maintain cyber insurance to cover damages, costs related to a system disruption, potential ransom and defense costs arising from unauthorized disclosure of, or failure to protect, private information, as well as costs for notification to, or for credit monitoring of, customers, employees and other persons in the event of a breach of private information. This insurance covers amounts paid to address a network attack or the disclosure of personal information, and costs of a qualified forensics firm to determine the cause, source and extent of a network attack or to investigate, examine and analyze our network to find the cause, source and extent of a data breach, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses. While we have implemented measures designed to prevent network attacks and mitigate their effects should they occur, these measures may not be effective due to the continually evolving nature of efforts to access confidential information.\nRegulatory, Legislative and Compliance Risks:\nThe actions of regulators and legislators could result in outcomes that may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity.\nThe rates that our electric, natural gas and water companies charge their customers are determined by their state regulatory commissions. These commissions also regulate the companies' accounting, operations, the issuance of certain securities and certain other matters. The FERC regulates the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at wholesale, accounting, issuance of certain securities and certain other matters, including reliability standards through the NERC. The regulatory process may be adversely affected by the political, regulatory and economic environment in the states in which we operate.\nUnder state and federal law, our electric, natural gas and water companies are entitled to charge rates that are sufficient to allow them an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred operating and capital costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, to attract needed capital and maintain their financial integrity, while also protecting relevant public interests. Our electric, natural gas and water companies are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services. Each of these companies prepares and submits periodic rate filings with their respective state regulatory commissions for review and approval, which allows for various entities to challenge our current or future rates, structures or mechanisms and could alter or limit the rates we are allowed to charge our customers. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns. Any change in rates, including changes in allowed rate of return, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings that can be contentious, lengthy, and subject to appeal. This may lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result of those proceedings. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed, including cost recovery mechanisms. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings or challenges to certain provisions in our distribution tariffs could have a significant effect on our ability to recover costs timely or at all or earn an adequate return. Adverse decisions in our proceedings could adversely affect our credit ratings, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. \nThe federal, state and local political and economic environment currently has, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on regulatory decisions with negative consequences for us. These regulatory decisions currently, and may in the future, require us to cancel, reduce, or delay planned development activities or other planned capital expenditures or investments or otherwise incur costs that we may not be able to recover through rates. There can be no assurance that regulators will approve the recovery of all costs incurred by our electric, natural gas and water companies, including costs for construction, operation and maintenance, and storm restoration. The inability to recover a significant amount of operating costs in a timely manner or at all could have an adverse effect on our credit ratings, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Changes to rates may occur at times different from when costs are incurred. Additionally, catastrophic events at other utilities could result in our regulators and legislators imposing additional requirements that may lead to additional costs for the companies. In addition to the risk of disallowance of incurred costs, regulators may also impose downward adjustments in a company’s allowed ROE as well as assess penalties and fines. These actions would have an adverse effect on our credit ratings, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe continue to experience challenges related to the regulatory environment in Connecticut with respect to our electric distribution, natural gas, and water businesses. S&P recently downgraded the credit ratings of Eversource and its regulated utilities as a result of the challenging regulatory environment in Connecticut. \nThe FERC has jurisdiction over our transmission costs recovery and our allowed ROEs. If FERC changes its methodology on developing ROEs, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, certain outside parties have filed four complaints against transmission-owning electric companies within ISO-NE alleging that our allowed ROEs are unjust and unreasonable. An adverse decision in any of these four complaints could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe FERC also has jurisdiction over our transmission rate incentives such as the regional transmission organization (RTO) participation ROE incentive adder, CWIP in rate base incentive and the abandoned plant incentive. If the FERC changes its policies regarding these incentives, there could be a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, the FERC issued a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) on Transmission Incentives that proposes to eliminate the existing RTO ROE incentive adder for utilities that have been participating in an RTO for more than three years. A FERC decision approving this proposal could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFERC's policy has encouraged competition for transmission projects, even within existing service territories of electric companies, as it looks to expand the transmission system to accommodate state and federal policy goals to utilize more renewable energy resources as well as to enhance reliability and resilience for extreme weather events. Implementation of FERC's goals, including within our service territories, may expose us to competition for construction of transmission projects, additional regulatory considerations, and potential delay with respect to future transmission projects, which may adversely affect our results of operations and lower rate base growth.\nChanges in tax laws, as well as the potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to significant reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions.\nBecause utility companies, including our electric, natural gas and water utility subsidiaries, have large customer bases, they are subject to adverse publicity focused on the safety and reliability of their distribution services and the speed with which they are able to respond to electric outages, natural gas leaks and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events, including those related to climate change. \nAdverse publicity of this nature could harm our reputation and the reputation of our subsidiaries; may make state legislatures, utility commissions and other regulatory authorities less likely to view us in a favorable light; and may cause us to be subject to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, legal claims or increased regulatory oversight. Unfavorable regulatory outcomes can include more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations, such as reliability and customer service quality standards or vegetation management requirements, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. Further, we rely upon purchased power and purchased natural gas supply from third parties to meet customers’ energy requirements. Due to a variety of factors, including the inflationary economic environment, geo-political conflicts, increased customer energy demand, the cost of energy supply, and public benefit charges assessed by our regulators, customer bills in New England remain high. We also may be required to implement rolling blackouts by ISO-NE, the region’s independent grid operator if enough capacity is not available in the area to meet peak demand needs. Significant cost increases, as well as any failure to meet customer energy requirements, could negatively impact the satisfaction of our customers and our customers’ ability to pay their utility bills, which could have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAddressing any adverse publicity, regulatory scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of our business, on the morale and performance of our employees and on our relationships with respective regulators, customers and counterparties. We are unable to predict future legislative or regulatory changes, initiatives or interpretations or other legal proceedings, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond adequately to such actions. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCosts of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, may increase and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur subsidiaries’ operations are subject to extensive and increasing federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations that govern, among other things, water quality (including treatment of PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) and lead), water discharges, the management of hazardous material and solid waste, and air emissions including greenhouse gases. Compliance with these requirements requires us to incur significant costs relating to environmental permitting, monitoring, maintenance and upgrading of facilities, remediation, and reporting. For our water business, compliance with water quality regulations, including those for PFAS and lead, could require the construction of facilities and replacement of customer lead service lines, respectively.\nThe costs of compliance with existing legal requirements or legal requirements not yet adopted may increase in the future. Although we have recorded liabilities for known environmental obligations, these costs can be difficult to estimate due to uncertainties about the extent of contamination, remediation alternatives, the remediation levels required by state and federal agencies, and the financial ability of other potentially responsible parties. An increase in such costs, unless promptly recovered, could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn each of the states that we operate, there are requirements for purchases of renewable energy credits from the generation of renewable energy. As the requirement for credits increase and outpace the renewable energy coming online, we may be required to pay higher prices and make alternative compliance payments to the states. Unless renewable energy availability is increased to meet these credit requirements, we will face the risk of increasing costs. \nFor further information, see Item 1, Business – Other Regulatory and Environmental Matters, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOffshore Wind Contingent Liability and Tax Risk: \nVariability in the costs and final investment returns of the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind offshore wind projects no longer owned by Eversource and the inability to monetize investment tax credits and investment tax credit adders could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. \nWe completed the sales of our offshore wind investments in 2024. Following the sale of our 50 percent ownership share in the South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects, we have continuing financial exposure as it relates to the purchase price post-closing adjustment payments under the terms of the sale agreement with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for these projects. Our future obligations under the sale terms primarily include a capital expenditure overrun sharing obligation, an obligation to maintain GIP’s internal rate of return through the construction period for each project, and obligation for other future costs. Post-closing purchase price adjustment payments will be made following the commercial operation of Revolution Wind. Factors that could increase the post-closing adjustment payments owed to GIP include the ultimate cost of construction and extent of cost overruns for Revolution Wind, delays in construction, which would impact the economics associated with the purchase price adjustment, and Revolution Wind’s eligibility for federal investment tax credits (ITCs) at a lower value than assumed and included in the purchase price. New information that becomes available or future developments that arise as construction progresses and as cost estimates are reviewed and revised could result in increased costs of the project that would ultimately be owed to GIP. Adverse changes in facts and circumstances could increase the obligation under the sale agreement above the amount accrued and result in additional losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe purchase price included the sales value related to a 40 percent level of federal ITCs, 10 percent of which is the energy community ITC adder included in the Inflation Reduction Act related to Revolution Wind. If the project does not meet the qualifications under federal tax law for the full value of the ITC or there are changes to tax law, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAdditionally, we hold a tax equity investment in South Fork Wind that is expected to result in cash flow benefits from ITCs at a 30 percent level. The tax deductibility of the ITCs could be challenged. If the project does not meet the qualifications under federal tax law, we may be unable to monetize the ITCs that support this investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. \nRisks Related to the Environment and Catastrophic Events:\nThe effects of climate change, including severe storms, could cause significant damage to any of our facilities requiring extensive expenditures, the recovery for which is subject to approval by regulators.\nClimate change creates physical and financial risks to our operations. Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea levels and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, extreme heat and weather events, including the effects of significantly stronger wind-related events. Customers’ energy and water needs vary with weather conditions, primarily related to temperature and humidity. For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use. For water customers, conservation measures imposed by the communities we serve could impact water usage. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy and water usage could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.\nSevere weather induced by climate change, such as extreme and frequent ice and snowstorms, tornadoes, micro-bursts, hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires, excess humidity and other natural or weather-related phenomenon, may cause outages and property damage, which may require us to incur additional costs that may not be recoverable from customers. The cost of repairing damage to our operating subsidiaries' facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to the increase in frequency and severity of storms, natural disasters or other catastrophic events could be substantial, particularly as regulators and customers demand better and quicker response times to outages. If, upon review, any of our state regulatory authorities finds that our actions were imprudent, some of those restoration costs may not be recoverable from customers and could result in penalties or fines. The inability to recover a significant amount of such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We maintain property insurance, but it may be insufficient in limits and coverage exclusions to cover all losses. Additionally, these types of weather events risk interruption of the supply chain and could disrupt the delivery of goods and services required for our operations.\nTransitional impacts related to climate change may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to costs associated with new technologies, evolving customer expectations and changing workforce needs.\nInitiatives to mitigate the impacts of climate change, support a transition to cleaner energy, and reduce emissions, may have a material adverse financial impact to our business. These impacts include the costs associated with the development and implementation of new technologies to maintain system reliability and resiliency and lower emissions, including grid modernization and energy storage. An increase in such costs, unless promptly recovered, could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. There may also be financial and reputational risks if we fail to meet evolving customer expectations, including enabling the integration of residential renewables and providing low carbon solutions, such as electric vehicle infrastructure and energy efficiency services. Additionally, actions to mitigate climate change may result in a transition in our workforce that must adapt to meet the need for new job skills. Associated costs include training programs for existing employees and workforce development as we transition to new technologies and clean energy solutions.\nAdequacy of water supplies and contamination of our water supplies, the failure of dams on reservoirs providing water to our customers, or requirements to repair, upgrade or dismantle any of these dams, may disrupt our ability to distribute water to our customers and result in substantial additional costs, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur water business faces an inherent strategic risk related to adequacy of supply (i.e., water scarcity). Water scarcity risk is heightened by multiple factors. We expect that climate change will cause both an increase in demand due to increasing temperatures and a potential for a decrease of available supply due to shifting rainfall and recharge patterns. Regulatory constraints also present challenges to permit new sources of supply in the region. In Connecticut, where the vast majority of our dams are located, impounded waterways are required to release minimum downstream flow. New regulations are being phased into effect over the next one to five years that will increase the volume of downstream releases required across our Connecticut service territory, depleting the volume of supply in storage that is used to meet customer demands. This combination of factors may cause an increased likelihood of drought emergencies and water use restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to provide water to our customers, and reputational/brand damage that could negatively impact our water business.\nOur water supplies, including water provided to our customers, are also subject to possible contamination from naturally occurring compounds and elements or non-organic substances, including PFAS. Our water systems include impounding dams and reservoirs and groundwater sources (e.g. wells and aquifers) of various sizes. Although we believe our water supply facilities, dams, reservoirs, and groundwater sources are structurally sound and well-maintained, significant damage to these facilities, or a significant decrease in the water supplies (reservoirs and groundwater), could adversely affect our ability to provide water to our customers until the facilities and a sufficient amount of water can be restored. A failure of a dam could result in personal injuries and downstream property damage for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams may not be recoverable in rates and may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We maintain liability insurance, but it may be insufficient in limits and coverage exclusions to cover all losses.\nPhysical attacks, including acts of war or terrorism, both threatened and actual, could adversely affect our ability to operate our systems and could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.\nPhysical attacks, including acts of war or terrorism, both threatened and actual, that damage our transmission and distribution systems or other assets could negatively impact our ability to transmit or distribute energy, water, natural gas, or operate our systems efficiently or at all. Because our electric transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, we face the risk of widespread blackouts due to grid disturbances or disruptions on a neighboring interconnected system. Similarly, our natural gas distribution system is connected to transmission pipelines not owned by Eversource. If there was an attack on the transmission pipelines, it could impact our ability to deliver natural gas. If our assets were physically damaged and were not recovered in a timely manner, it could result in a loss of service to customers, a significant decrease in revenues, significant expense to repair system damage, costs associated with governmental actions in response to such attacks, and liability claims, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We maintain property and liability insurance, but it may be insufficient in limits and coverage exclusions to cover all losses. In addition, physical attacks against third-party providers could have a similar effect on the operation of our systems.\nBusiness and Operational Risks:\nStrategic development or investment opportunities in electric transmission, distributed generation, or clean-energy technologies may not be successful, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.\nWe are pursuing investment opportunities in electric transmission facilities, distributed generation and other clean-energy infrastructure, including interconnection facilities. The development of these projects involve numerous significant risks including federal, state and local permitting and regulatory approval processes, scheduling or permitting delays, increased costs, tax strategies and changes to federal tax laws, new legislation impacting the industry, including clean energy programs, economic events or factors, environmental, community, and customer affordability concerns, design and siting issues, difficulties in obtaining required rights of way, and competition from incumbent utilities and other entities. Also, supply constraints in New England have led to significant increases in commodity costs which may impact our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. Further, regional clean energy goals may not be achieved if local, state, and federal policy is not in alignment with integrated planning of our infrastructure investments. \nOur transmission and distribution systems may not operate as expected, and could require unplanned expenditures, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur ability to safely and properly operate our transmission and distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our business. Our transmission and distribution businesses face several operational risks, including the breakdown, failure of, or damage to operating equipment, information technology systems, or processes, especially due to age; labor disputes; disruptions in the delivery of electricity, natural gas and water; increased capital expenditure requirements, including those due to environmental regulation; catastrophic events resulting from equipment failures such as wildfires and explosions, or external events such as a solar event, an electromagnetic event, or other similar occurrences; increasingly severe weather conditions due to climate change beyond equipment and plant design capacity; human error; global supply chain disruptions; and potential claims for property damage or personal injuries beyond the scope of our insurance coverage. Many of our transmission projects are expected to alleviate identified reliability issues and reduce customers' costs. However, if the in-service date for one or more of these projects is delayed due to economic events or factors, or regulatory or other delays, including permitting and siting, the risk of failures in the electric transmission system may increase. We also implement new information technology systems from time to time, which may disrupt operations. Any failure of our transmission and distribution systems to operate as planned may result in increased capital costs, reduced earnings or unplanned increases in operations and maintenance costs. The inability to recover a significant amount of such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nNew technology and alternative energy sources could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nAdvances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy to a level that is competitive with that of current electric production methods, could result in loss of market share and customers, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive. These changes in technology, including micro-grids and advances in energy or battery storage, could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize energy, which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. Economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs typically can lead to the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency and self-generation by customers. Additionally, in response to risks posed by climate change, we may need to make investments in our system including upgrades or retrofits to meet enhanced design criteria, which can incur additional costs over conventional solutions.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for equipment, materials, and services and we outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and substandard performance or inability to fulfill obligations by those third parties could harm our business, reputation and results of operations.\nWe outsource certain services to third parties in areas including information technology, transaction processing, human resources, payroll and payroll processing and certain operational areas. Outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to substandard quality of service delivery or substandard deliverables, which may result in missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards) or reputational harm, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Our contractual arrangements with these contractors typically include performance standards, progress payments, insurance requirements and security for performance. The global supply chain of goods and services generally has stabilized; however, certain specialized equipment has long lead times and inflated prices. \nAdditionally, rising geo-political tensions could negatively impact the global supply chain. If significant difficulties in the global supply chain cycle or inflationary impacts were to reemerge, they could adversely affect our results of operations, or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators, unions, customers or employees.\nThe loss of key personnel, the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, or the failure to maintain a positive relationship with our workforce could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur operations depend on the continued efforts of our employees. Retaining key employees and maintaining the ability to attract new employees are important to both our operational and financial performance. We cannot guarantee that any member of our management or any key employee at the Eversource parent or subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time. Our workforce in our subsidiaries includes many workers with highly specialized skills safely maintaining and servicing the electric, natural gas and water infrastructure that cannot be quickly replaced due to the technically complex work they perform. We have developed strategic workforce plans to identify key functions and proactively implement plans to assure a ready and qualified workforce, but we cannot predict the impact of these plans on our ability to hire and retain key employees. Labor disputes, work stoppages or an inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on commercially reasonable terms, as well as the increased competition for talent or the intentional misconduct of employees or contractors, may also have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. \nFinancial, Economic, and Market Risks:\nLimits on our access to, or increases in, the cost of capital may adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe use short-term debt and the long-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not obtained from our operating cash flow. If access to these sources of liquidity becomes constrained, our ability to implement our business strategy could be adversely affected. In addition, interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly, which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. S&P recently downgraded the credit ratings of Eversource and its regulated utilities as a result of the challenging regulatory environment in Connecticut. Downgrades of our credit ratings or events beyond our control, such as a disruption in global capital and credit markets, could increase our cost of borrowing and cost of capital or restrict our ability to access the capital markets and negatively affect our ability to maintain and to expand our businesses.\nMarket performance or changes in assumptions may require us to make significant contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nWe provide a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefits for a substantial number of employees, former employees and retirees. Our future pension obligations, costs and liabilities are highly dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include estimated investment returns, interest rates, discount rates, health care cost trends, benefit changes, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs could increase significantly. In addition, various factors, including underperformance of plan investments and changes in law or regulation, could increase the amount of contributions required to fund our pension plan in the future. Additional large funding requirements, when combined with the financing requirements of our construction program, could impact the timing, amounts, and number of future financings and negatively affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nGoodwill, investments in equity method investments, and long-lived assets if impaired and written down, could adversely affect our future operating results and total capitalization.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet, which, as of December 31, 2024 totaled $3.57 billion. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. We test our goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events occur, or circumstances change that would indicate a potential for impairment. A determination that goodwill is deemed to be impaired would result in a non-cash charge that could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and total capitalization.\nWe assess our investments (recorded as either long-lived assets or equity method investments) for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. To the extent the value of the investment becomes impaired, the impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur counterparties may not meet their obligations to us or may elect to exercise their termination rights, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements that owe us money, have contracted to supply us with energy or other commodities or services, or that work with us as strategic partners, including on significant capital projects, will not be able to perform their obligations, will terminate such arrangements or, with respect to our credit facilities, fail to honor their commitments. Should any of these counterparties fail to perform their obligations or terminate such arrangements, we might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at higher market prices and/or have to delay the completion of, or cancel, a capital project. Should any lenders under our credit facilities fail to perform, the level of borrowing capacity under those arrangements could decrease. In any such events, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nAs a holding company with no revenue-generating operations, Eversource parent's liquidity is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries, its commercial paper program, and its ability to access the long-term debt and equity capital markets.\nEversource parent is a holding company and as such, has no revenue-generating operations of its own. Its ability to meet its debt service obligations and to pay dividends on its common shares is largely dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay borrowings from, Eversource parent, and/or Eversource parent's ability to access its commercial paper program or the long-term debt and equity capital markets. Prior to funding Eversource parent, the subsidiary companies have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, their operating expenses, debt service, preferred dividends of certain subsidiaries, and obligations to trade creditors. Should the subsidiary companies not be able to pay dividends or repay funds due to Eversource parent, or if Eversource parent cannot access its commercial paper programs or the long-term debt and equity capital markets, Eversource parent's ability to pay interest, dividends and its own debt obligations would be restricted.",
