      "text": "Item 1. Business\nAZZ Inc. (\"AZZ\", the \"Company\", \"our\" or \"we\") was established in 1956 and incorporated under the laws of the state of Texas. We are a provider of hot-dip galvanizing and coil coating solutions to a broad range of end markets in North America. We have three distinct operating segments: the AZZ Metal Coatings segment, the AZZ Precoat Metals segment, and the AZZ Infrastructure Solutions segment. Our AZZ Metal Coatings segment is a leading provider of metal coating solutions for corrosion protection, including hot-dip galvanizing, spin galvanizing, powder coating, anodizing and plating to the North American steel fabrication industry and other industries. The AZZ Precoat Metals segment provides aesthetic and corrosion protective coatings and related value-added services for steel and aluminum coil, primarily serving the construction; appliance; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); container; transportation and other end markets in North America. The AZZ Infrastructure Solutions segment represents our 40% non-controlling interest in AIS Investment Holdings LLC (the \"AVAIL JV\"). AIS Investment Holdings LLC is primarily dedicated to delivering safe and reliable transmission of power from generation sources to end customers, and automated weld overlay solutions for corrosion and erosion mitigation to critical infrastructure in markets worldwide.\nUnless stated otherwise, the discussion of our business and financial information throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing operations and results from continuing operations.\nStrategy \nAZZ is North America’s leading independent post-fabrication hot-dip galvanizing and coil coating solutions company with leading positions in markets we serve. Our business segments provide sustainable, unmatched metal coating solutions that reduce emissions, extend the lifecycle, and enhance the appearance of buildings products and infrastructure that are essential to everyday life. We strive to provide high quality manufactured solutions to our customers while delivering long-term value to our shareholders by:\n•Integrating human capital, diversity and environmental initiatives into our operations and corporate culture; \n•Ensuring shareholder engagement is embedded into developing and executing on AZZ’s strategic goals; \n•Driving profitable growth in our AZZ Metal Coatings and AZZ Precoat Metals segments; and \n•Targeting increased capital returns to shareholders.\nSeasonality\nOur business is cyclical in nature, as seasonal fluctuations affect volumes, revenue, and earnings. Historically, we experience increases in our business during the warmer months, and slowdowns during the winter, as the largest portion of our business is related to the construction industry. Volumes, operating costs and earnings can also be adversely affected by inclement weather, especially the impact of severe winter weather in our fourth fiscal quarter.\nAZZ Metal Coatings Segment\nThe AZZ Metal Coatings segment provides hot-dip galvanizing, spin galvanizing, powder coating, anodizing and plating, and other metal coating applications to the steel fabrication industry and other industries through facilities located throughout North America. Hot-dip galvanizing is a metallurgical manufacturing process in which molten zinc reacts with steel, which provides corrosion protection and extends the lifecycle of fabricated steel for several decades. As of February 28, 2025, we operated 41 galvanizing plants, six surface technologies plants and one tubing plant, located in various locations throughout the United States and Canada.\nCompetition\nMetal coating is a highly competitive business, and we compete with other galvanizing companies, captive galvanizing facilities operated by manufacturers, and alternate forms of corrosion protection such as material selection (stainless steel or aluminum) or alternative barrier protections such as paint and weathering steel. Our galvanizing markets are generally limited to areas within relatively close proximity to our metal coating plants.\nWe typically serve fabricators or manufacturers that provide solutions to the transmission and distribution, bridge and highway, petrochemical and general industrial markets, and numerous original equipment manufacturers. We do not depend on any single customer for a significant amount of our sales, and we do not believe the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated sales or net income.\nResources\nZinc, the principal raw material used in the galvanizing process, is currently readily available, but can be subject to volatile pricing. We manage our exposure to changes in our cost of zinc by entering into agreements with our zinc suppliers and such agreements generally include fixed premiums. We may or may not continue to use these or other strategies to manage commodity risk in the future. \nFor additional information on the AZZ Metal Coatings segment's operating results, see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis—Results of Operations.\" For additional financial information by segment, see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 18.\" \nAZZ Precoat Metals Segment\n AZZ Precoat Metals provides coil coating application of protective and decorative coatings and related value-added downstream processing for steel and aluminum coils. Primarily serving the construction, appliance, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), container, transportation, and other end markets, the coil coating process emphasizes sustainability and enhanced product lifecycles. It involves cleaning, treating, painting, and curing metal coils as a flat material before they are cut, formed, and fabricated into finished products. This highly efficient method optimizes waste through tight film control and improves final product performance by painting and curing the substrates under conditions unmatched by other application processes. The acquisition of Precoat Metals in fiscal year 2023 finalized our goal of strategic transformation to position AZZ for the future as a focused metal coatings solutions company. The AZZ Precoat Metals segment operates through 13 plants located in the United States, with the newest facility in Washington, Missouri which became operational in fiscal year 2026.\nCompetition\nAZZ Precoat Metals operates in a highly competitive industry, where we compete with other toll coil coaters, and integrated steel and aluminum mills. We also face competition from alternative forms of coated metal, such as powder-coated metal, or from other potential substrates such as wood, plastics, or concrete that could be used in place of painted metal.\nWe primarily serve distributors, fabricators and manufacturers that ultimately provide manufactured painted products to the construction, appliance, HVAC, transportation, container, and general industrial markets, as well as numerous original \nequipment manufacturers. We do not depend on any single customer for a significant amount of our sales, and we do not believe the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated sales or net income.\nResources\nPaint and customer-owned substrate availability are important for our toll-coating process. Although paint prices have risen in recent years, we carry limited risk associated with paint cost, as it is a pass-through to our customer base. There are currently no concerns regarding the availability of customer-owned bare substrate as an input to our coil coating process.\nFor additional information on the AZZ Precoat Metals segment's operating results, see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis—Results of Operations.\" For additional financial information by segment, see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 18.\" \nAZZ Infrastructure Solutions Segment\nAZZ's Infrastructure Solutions segment consists of the equity in earnings of our 40% investment in the AVAIL JV, as well as other expenses directly related to AIS receivables and liabilities that were retained following the divestiture of the AIS business.\n The AVAIL JV is a leading provider of specialized products and services primarily designed to support industrial and electrical applications. The segment's product offerings include custom switchgear, electrical enclosures, medium and high voltage bus ducts, and explosion proof and hazardous duty lighting products, which supports the delivery of safe and reliable transmission of power from generation sources to end customers. In addition to our product offerings, our AZZ Infrastructure Solutions segment also focuses on life-cycle extension for the power generation, refining and industrial infrastructure, through providing automated weld overlay solutions for corrosion and erosion mitigation. \nFor additional information regarding the AZZ Infrastructure Solutions financial results, see \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 19.\"\nOn March 10, 2025, AIS Investment Holdings LLC, which operates under the name \"AVAIL Infrastructure Solutions,\" entered into a definitive agreement to sell the electrical enclosures, switchgear, and bus systems businesses (the \"Electrical Products Group\") of AVAIL to nVent Electric plc (\"nVent\"), for a purchase price of $975 million, The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.\nFollowing the sale, we will continue to own a 40% interest in AVAIL through the AVAIL JV, which will consist of AVAIL Infrastructure Solution’s Industrial Lighting and Welding Solutions Businesses. \nHuman Capital Management\nAt AZZ, our culture is defined by trust, respect, accountability, integrity, teamwork and sustainability (\"TRAITS\"). We value our employees by continuously investing in a healthy work-life balance, offering competitive compensation and benefit packages and a team-oriented environment centered on professional service and open communication among our employees. We are dedicated to our employees by fully training and equipping them and providing a safe environment to grow personally and professionally. We strive to build, maintain and create a work environment that attracts and retains employees who are high contributors, have outstanding skills, are engaged in our culture, and who embody our Company mission: to create superior value in a culture where people can grow both professionally and personally, and where TRAITS matter.\nAttracting, developing and retaining the best talent in our industry is important to all aspects of AZZ’s long-term strategy and continued success. We recognize that an engaged workforce directly contributes to our efforts to improve AZZ’s sustainability and performance.\nOur Employees\nAs of February 28, 2025, we employed approximately 3,684 people worldwide, of which 3,358 were employed in the U.S. and 326 were employed in Canada. Our total workforce consisted of approximately 83% hourly employees and 17% salaried employees. Of our total employees as of February 28, 2025, 668 were covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nDiversity and Inclusion \nWe embrace the diversity of our employees, customers, vendors, suppliers, stakeholders and consumers, including their unique backgrounds, experiences, skills and talents. Everyone is valued and appreciated for their distinct contributions to the growth and sustainability of our business. \nEqual Opportunity Employment is a fundamental principle of AZZ, where employment and applications for employment are evaluated based upon a person’s capabilities and qualifications without discrimination based on actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, genetic information, marital status, veteran status, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic as established by applicable local, state, federal or international laws. This principle is incorporated into each of our policies and procedures relating to recruitment, hiring, promotions, compensation, benefits, discipline, termination and all of our terms and conditions of employment. We seek to continuously improve our hiring, development, advancement and retention of diverse talent and our overall diversity representation.\nAs of February 28, 2025, our U.S. employees had the following race and ethnicity demographics:\n\nWhite                                     42.6   %\nHispanic                                  37.3   %\nAfrican American                          12.8   %\nAsian                                      1.4   %\nMulti-Racial                               1.0   %\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native           0.5   %\nNot Stated                                 4.4   %\nApproximately 53.0% of our employees are diverse, as reported to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nAs of February 28, 2025, our employees had the following gender demographics:\n\n                                              Women         Men\nU.S. Employees                                14.7%       85.3%\nGlobal Employees(1)                            4.6%       95.4%\n(1) Includes employees in Canada.                              \nAdditionally, 12.5% of the executive team and 16.7% of our non-employee Board members are female. \nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nWe are committed to paying our employees competitive and fair compensation that is commensurate with their position and performance and is competitive in the markets in which they work. We conduct regular surveys of the market rates for jobs to ensure that our compensation is competitive. We offer annual merit-based increases, as well as annual short- and long-term incentive packages that are aligned with our vision and key business objectives and are intended to motivate strong performance. \nWe believe our employees are critical to the success of our business and we structure our benefits package to attract and retain a highly talented and engaged workforce. We are continuously evolving our programs to adapt to our employees’ and their family’s needs, and to provide comprehensive health, wellness and quality of life coverage.

AZZ supports enterprise-wide professional development by offering a variety of instructor-led and self-paced learning programs ranging in audience from individual contributors to supervisors and executive leadership. We also provide a variety of resources to help our employees grow professionally and personally and build new skills, including (i) online development courses containing unlimited access to more than 4,500 learning modules, (ii) continuing education credits, and (iii) learning preferences such as in-person seminars, videos and webinars. AZZ also provides tuition assistance for employees enrolled in higher education programs directed at improving their performance or helping them prepare for future leadership roles within the Company and emphasizes individual development training as part of our annual performance goal setting process. \nPeriodically, all employees have the opportunity and are encouraged to provide feedback on their employee experience through an anonymous employee survey. The feedback received through this survey is used to drive actions to improve the overall experience for employees across the Company, as well as to support continuous improvement in leader effectiveness and to enhance our corporate culture.\nHealth and Safety\nCore to our corporate values, AZZ emphasizes safeguarding our people and fostering a culture of safety awareness that promotes the wellbeing of our employees, contractors and business partners. We maintain a safety culture grounded on the premise of eliminating workplace incidents, risks and hazards, while operating and delivering our work responsibly and sustainably. AZZ has created and implemented training and audit processes and incident learning communications to help mitigate safety events and to reduce the frequency and severity of accidents. AZZ has safety teams and has a formal mentor training program that includes a diverse group of management and hourly employees that contribute to the overall safety culture of our facilities. \nWe review and monitor safety performance closely. Our goal is to achieve zero serious injuries through continued investments in core safety programs and injury reduction initiatives. We utilize a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of our operations. Lagging indicators include the Occupational Safety & Health Administration: (i) Total Recordable Incident Rate (\"TRIR\"); (ii) Lost Time (or Lost Workday) Incident Rate (\"LTIR\") based upon the number of incidents per 100 employees (or per 200,000 work hours); and (iii) Days Away, Restricted or Transferred rate (\"DART\"). Leading indicators include reporting of all near miss events as well as Environmental, Health and Safety (\"EHS\") coaching and engagement. In fiscal year 2025, we continued to demonstrate excellence in safety across our 61 plants worldwide, and incident rates as indicated below:\n\n                                        TRIR                 LTIR                 DART\nAZZ Metal Coatings Segment          2.06                 0.70                 1.25    \nAZZ Precoat Metals Segment          2.51                 0.15                 0.52    \nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe names, ages, and experience of our executive officers as of April 21, 2025 are as follows:\n\nName                                      Age              Business Experience of Executive Officers for Past Five Years                 Held Since\n                                                                    Position or Office with Registrant or Prior Employer                           \nThomas E.

We believe the risks described below are the most significant risks and uncertainties facing our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below may also impair our business operations in the future. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth could be negatively or materially impacted. Carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when deciding whether to invest in our securities or when evaluating our business. You should also refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements contained here under the heading \"Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations \nOur business segments operate in highly competitive markets.\nCompetition is based on a number of factors, including price. Certain competitors in each of our segments may have lower cost structures or larger economies of scale on raw materials and therefore, may be able to provide their manufactured solutions at lower prices than we are able to provide. If our response to competitor pricing actions is not timely, we could be impacted by loss of market share. We cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide manufactured solutions that are superior to ours in price, delivery time or quality in the future. Similarly, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industries, maintain our customer base at current levels or increase our customer base.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. \nOur quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by the following, among others:\n•Changes in political actions and landscapes across the globe, including global conflicts;\n•Unstable political economic conditions and public health issues or crisis, such as a pandemic, delaying our or our customer's operations;\n•Timing and volume of work under new or existing agreements;\n•General economic conditions;\n•Fluctuations in the budgetary spending of customers, including seasonality;\n•Increases in manufacturing or transportation costs;\n•Losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance; \n•Delays of raw materials or component suppliers;\n•A change in the demand of our manufactured solutions caused by severe weather conditions;\n•A change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;\n•Modifications or changes in customer delivery schedules;\n•Ability or willingness of customers to timely pay their invoices when owed to us; and\n•Changes in interest rates.\nAccordingly, our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results expected for any other quarter or for the entire year. \nOur business requires skilled labor, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur ability to maintain our productivity and profitability could be limited by an inability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our labor requirements. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a shortage of skilled personnel, increases in labor-related costs, or both. It is necessary that we maintain a skilled labor force to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Labor shortages or increased labor-related costs could impair our ability to maintain our profit margins or impact our ability to sustain and grow our sales.\nTechnological innovations by competitors may make existing production methods obsolete.\nThe manufactured solutions we provide require evolving technologies for success in the markets we serve. The competitive environments can be highly sensitive to technological innovation. It is possible for our competitors, or new market place entrants, either foreign or domestic, to develop new manufactured solution methods or technologies which could make our existing manufactured solutions and methods obsolete, hasten their obsolescence or materially reduce our competitive advantage in the markets we serve.\nOur business segments are cyclical and are sensitive to economic downturns.\nOur business often aligns with the economic environments that we operate within and is subject to seasonality within the annual operating cycle of the business. Our customers may also delay or cancel new or previously planned projects. If there is a downturn in the general economies in which we operate, there could be a material adverse effect on price levels and the quantity of goods and services purchased by our customers, which could adversely impact our sales, consolidated results from operations and cash flows. A number of factors, including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve, could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund their internal projects in the future and pay for services. Certain economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of one or more of our key suppliers, which could affect our ability to secure raw materials and components to meet our customers’ demand for our manufactured solutions in the future. Other various factors impact demand for our manufactured solutions, including the price of commodities (such as zinc, natural gas or other commodities), paint, economic forecasts and financial markets. Uncertainty in the economy and financial markets could impact our customers and could, in turn, severely impact the demand for corporate infrastructure projects which could result in a reduction in orders for our manufactured solutions. All of these factors combined together could materially impact our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nInternational events and political issues may adversely affect our operating segments.\nA portion of the sales from our segments are from markets outside the U.S. The occurrence of any of the risks described below could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition:\n•political and economic instability in the countries where we conduct business; \n•social unrest, acts of war, terrorism, severe weather events, other natural conditions, and global outbreaks of contagious diseases;\n•inflation, or hyper-inflation or recession;\n•significant currency fluctuations, currency devaluations or restrictions on currency conversions;\n•governmental activities that limit or disrupt markets, restrict payments or limit the movement of funds;\n•trade restrictions, tariffs and economic embargoes by the United States or other countries; and\n•travel restrictions placed upon personnel.\nCatastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from acts of war and terrorism, severe weather events and other natural conditions such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and other severe weather conditions, or the outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases could potentially cause future disruption in our business. At this time, the ongoing armed conflicts in Ukraine, Israel and the broader Middle East have not materially impacted our operations. However, any disruption of our customers or suppliers and their respective contract manufacturers from the ongoing conflicts or new conflicts could likely impact our future sales and operating results. In addition, the spread of contagious diseases could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, and result in an economic downturn that could affect the demand for our manufactured solutions. These situations are outside of the Company’s control and any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nSupply chain disruptions and inflation in the price of energy and certain raw materials for our business segments may adversely affect our operations.\nWithin our AZZ Metal Coatings segment, zinc and natural gas costs represent a large portion of our cost of sales. In our AZZ Precoat Metals segment, paint and natural gas costs represent a large portion of our cost of sales.\nFor both segments, operating margins could be negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions and adverse price movements in the market for zinc and natural gas. Unanticipated commodity price increases could significantly increase our operating costs if we cannot pass the costs to our customers, and could potentially adversely affect profitability. The following factors, which are beyond our control, affect the price of raw materials and energy for our segments: \n•supply and demand; \n•freight costs and transportation availability; \n•trade duties and taxes; and \n•labor disputes. \nWe seek to maintain our operating margins by increasing the price of our manufactured solutions in response to increased costs, but we may not be successful in passing these increased costs of operation through to our customers. Even if successful, there is no guarantee the increased price would not negatively affect the volume of future orders. While we are exposed to inflationary pressures for zinc and energy, we evaluate market conditions and follow a general practice of locking in the fixed premiums associated with zinc on annual contracts unless market conditions dictate otherwise, and we enter into energy contracts for gas and electricity normally for durations of six to twelve months to reduce risks associated with large fluctuations in these commodities. \nNo other individual material input cost represents a significant portion of our cost of sales other than those previously discussed. We believe for the remaining input costs any price increase would not be able to significantly affect margins even if the increased costs could not be passed on to our customers.\nA failure in our operational information systems, or the occurrence of cyber incidents or cyber security attacks at any of our facilities or those of our third-party suppliers and service providers, may adversely affect our financial results. Such incidents or cyber security attacks may also result in faulty business decisions, operational inefficiencies, damage to our reputation or our employee and business relationships, and/or subject us to costs, fines, or lawsuits.\nOur business is heavily supported by operational systems to process large amounts of data and support complex transactions. If significant financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail, experience actual or attempted cyber-attacks or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our financial or operational systems. Third-parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to customer or supplier data or our internal data, including intellectual property, financial, and other confidential business information. Due to increased technology advances, we are more reliant on technologies to support our operations. We use computer software and programs to run our financial and operational information, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Cyber-attacks are an ever-increasing risk to companies. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, third-party service providers and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information and data. While we have security measures in place, our systems, networks, and third-party service providers have been and will continue to be subject to ongoing threats. We believe our mitigation measures reduce but cannot eliminate the risk of a cyber incident; however, there can be no assurance that our existing and planned precautions of backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols and other procedures will be adequate to prevent significant damage, system failure or data loss and the same is true for our suppliers and other third parties on which we rely. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and are typically not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative or mitigating measures. We and our third-party service providers have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual or attempted cyber-attacks of our information systems or networks; however, none of these actual or attempted cyber-attacks had a material impact on our operations or financial condition. Any significant cyber security attacks that affect our facilities, our customers, our key suppliers, or material financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. \nIn addition, cyber-attacks on our customers, suppliers and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and could negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failures or cyber-attacks. An unauthorized disclosure or use of information could cause interruptions in our operations and might require us to spend significant management time and other resources investigating the event and dealing with local and federal law enforcement. \nOccurrences of any of the events discussed above could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may lose some of our competitive advantage. \nWe possess intellectual property, which is instrumental in our ability to compete and grow our business. If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, we could lose our competitive advantage. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret protection and contractual rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. In addition, our competitors may develop proprietary information or manufacturing technologies that are equivalent or superior to our intellectual property. Despite our safeguards and controls, our intellectual property may be misappropriated by our employees, our competitors, or other third parties. Failure of our copyrights, trademarks and trade secret protection, non-\ndisclosure agreements and other measures to provide protection of our technologies and our intellectual property rights could enable our competitors to more effectively compete with us and could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDefects in the solutions we provide could increase our cost of quality and could result in consequential damage claims. \nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the manufacture and sale of our solutions. We provide assurance-type warranties for our manufactured solutions. Widespread manufacturing defects and quality system failures could result in significant losses due to the costs of containment, the destruction of customer-owned inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of a solution for a period of time. We may not be able to obtain indemnity or reimbursement from our suppliers or other third parties for the costs or liabilities associated with our suppliers' products. A significant warranty claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our business reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our solutions or offerings. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Strategy\nOur acquisition strategy involves a number of risks.\nWe intend to pursue continued growth through acquiring the assets of target companies that will enable us to (i) expand our product and service offerings and (ii) increase our geographic footprint. We routinely review potential acquisitions. However, we may be unable to implement this growth strategy if we are not able to reach agreement on mutually acceptable terms to complete the acquisition. Moreover, our acquisition strategy involves certain risks, including:\n•risks and liabilities from our acquisitions that may not be discovered during the pre-acquisition due diligence process;\n•difficulties in the post-acquisition integration of internal controls, operations and systems;\n•termination of relationships with key personnel and customers of the acquired company;\n•potential failure to add additional employees to manage the increased volume of business;\n•additional post-acquisition challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and legal compliance;\n•disruption of our ongoing business or an inability of our ongoing business to receive sufficient management attention; \n•failure to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated prior to acquisition;\n•expansion through acquisition may expose us to new business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks associated with such expansion, both inside and outside of the U.S.; and\n•counterparties to the transaction may fail to perform.\nFuture acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available to us, and/or may increase our leverage ratios.\nWe may be unsuccessful at implementing and generating internal growth from our strategic growth initiatives.\nOur ability to generate internal growth will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to: \n•attract new customers, internationally and domestically;\n•integrate regulatory changes;\n•increase the number or size of projects performed for existing customers;\n•hire and retain employees:\n•complete construction projects in a timely manner; and\n•increase volume utilizing existing facilities.\nMany of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth through our initiatives may be beyond our control, and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.\nThe departure of key personnel could disrupt our business.\nWe depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and senior management team. We cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The future loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business, which could disrupt our operations or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Legal Liability, Taxes, and Regulations \nActual and potential claims, lawsuits, and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and negatively impact our financial condition. \nThe Company could be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages from us in connection with the operation of our business. Most actions filed against our Company typically arise out of the normal course of business related to commercial disputes regarding the manufactured solutions we provide. We could potentially be a plaintiff in legal proceedings against our customers, in which we seek to recover payments of contractual amounts we believe are due to us and indemnity claims for increased costs or damages incurred by our Company. Under applicable accounting literature, and when appropriate, we establish financial provisions for certain legal exposures meeting the criteria of being both probable and reasonably estimable. Where material, we may adjust any such financial provisions depending on developments related to each case. If our assumptions and estimates related to such exposures prove to be inadequate or incorrect, or we have material adverse claims or lawsuits, such events could harm our business reputation, divert management resources away from operating our business, and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nChanges to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations and foreign government regulations could adversely affect our business, operating results, foreign operations, sourcing of materials and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by:\n•changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions; \n•changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently manufacture, distribute and/or sell our manufactured solutions or conduct our business, or any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes; \n•new tariffs or changes in existing tariffs; and \n•other changes in U.S. trade policy.\nAll of the above listed changes have the potential to adversely impact the economies in which we operate or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the demand for our manufactured solutions, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. \nOur business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import or export manufactured solutions at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, reporting obligations pertaining to \"conflict minerals\" mined from certain countries, additional workplace regulations, or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation or exportation of our manufactured solutions in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. Future quotas, duties, or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, which established annual disclosure and reporting requirements for publicly-traded companies that use tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold (collectively, \"conflict minerals\") mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their manufactured solutions, we are subject to certain annual disclosures and audit requirements. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs for due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our manufactured solutions and other potential changes to manufactured solutions, processes, or sources of supply. Despite our continued due diligence efforts, in the future we may be unable to verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our component products. As a result, we could potentially face reputational and other challenges with our customers that require that all of the components incorporated in our manufactured solutions be certified as conflict-free.\nAdoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations could make it easier for our employees to obtain union representation and our business could be adversely impacted.\nAs of February 28, 2025, 668 (or 18.1%) of our full-time employees were represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements. Our U.S.-based employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form \nor affiliate with a union. If a large portion of our U.S. workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our operating costs and adversely impact our profitability. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of new regulations, or the enactment of new legislation could have an adverse impact on our business to the extent it becomes easier for workers to obtain union representation.\nChanges in labor or employment laws, including minimum wage rules, could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.\nVarious federal, state and international labor and employment laws govern our relationship with employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers’ compensation rates, leaves of absence, mandated health and other benefits, and citizenship requirements. Significant additional government-imposed increases or new requirements in these areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nRisks Related to Environmental Conditions\nClimate change could impact our business. \nClimate change could present risks to our future operations from severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts or flooding. Consequences of such extreme weather conditions could include physical risks to our facilities, supply chain disruptions, increased operational costs, as well as the price and/or availability of insurance coverage for Company assets. We cannot predict the potential timing or impact from potential global warming, winter storms and other severe weather events and other natural conditions. We carry certain limits of insurance to mitigate the potential effects of events that could impact our business, as well as disaster recovery plans related to any potential severe weather events and other natural conditions that might occur within regions in which we have operations, or at any of the Company locations. \nChanges in environmental laws and regulations and heightened focus on corporate sustainability initiatives and practices are under increased scrutiny by both governmental and non-governmental bodies, which could cause a change in our business practices by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs, which could impact our future operating results.\nOver the past several years, there has been a heightened focus by both governmental and non-governmental bodies requesting disclosure of information relating to corporate sustainability practices as well as an increase in customers' preference to source from suppliers who have implemented effective sustainability initiatives. International agreements, national and regional legislation, and regulatory measures to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and require companies to more efficiently use energy, water and reduce waste, are in various stages of discussion and/or implementation across the globe. These laws, regulations and policies, as well as other sustainability demands made by governmental and non-governmental bodies may result in the need for future capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. We cannot predict the level of expenditures or potential impact to the Company that may be required to comply with these evolving environmental and sustainability laws and regulations due to the uncertainties on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and our activities in each one of these jurisdictions.\nThe financial impact of the heightened focus on sustainability practices for all companies to increase efficiencies in consumption of resources and regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n•the sectors covered;\n•future permitted levels for greenhouse gas emissions;\n•the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to invest in additional compliance equipment or compliance instruments, either on the open market or through auctions; \n•the price and availability of emission allowances and credits; and \n•the impact of legislation or other regulation on our ability to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of our manufactured solutions.\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of future changes to the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the environment and other sustainability matters.\nVarious regulations have been implemented regarding emissions, the environment and other sustainability matters. We cannot predict future changes in the law and government regulations regarding emissions, the environment and other \nsustainability matters, or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to any future legislation. While the Company actively is engaged in enhancing our environmental, social and governance programs, changes in laws or governmental regulations could negatively impact our business or the demand for our manufactured solutions by customers, other industry related participants, or our investors, and could result in a negative impact to our operations, profitability, or our ability to perform projects in the future.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters and Our Capital Structure\nThe Company’s flexibility to operate its business could be impacted by provisions in its debt obligations.\nThe Company’s debt instruments, consisting of a term loan and a revolving credit facility, contain covenants which restrict or prohibit certain actions (\"negative covenants\"). These restrictions include, but are not limited to, the Company's ability to incur debt, restrictions or limitations on certain liens, capital spending limits, the ability to engage in certain merger, acquisition, or divestiture actions, or to increase dividends beyond a specific level. The Company’s debt instruments also contain covenants requiring the Company to, among other things, maintain specified financial ratios (\"affirmative covenants\"). Failure to comply with these negative covenants and affirmative covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could restrict the Company’s liquidity and have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or prospects. If the Company does not have enough cash to service its debt or fund other liquidity needs, the Company may be required to take actions such as requesting a waiver from lenders, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing all or part of the existing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. The Company cannot assure that any of these remedies can be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur indebtedness and restrictive debt covenants could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, our ability to meet our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness or could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility. Our Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These covenants may limit our ability to optimally operate our business. In addition, our Credit Agreement requires that we meet certain financial tests, including a leverage ratio test. Our increased indebtedness and these restrictive covenants could adversely affect our ability to:\n•finance our operations;\n•make needed capital expenditures;\n•make strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into joint ventures;\n•withstand a future downturn in our business, industry or the economy in general;\n•engage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our best interest; and\n•plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nThe covenant restrictions related to our indebtedness could impact our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these restrictions, we could be limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date and the termination of future funding commitments by our lenders. Historically, we have successfully refinanced our long-term debt to lower interest rates; however, if we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings in the future, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The Credit Agreement contains cross-default provisions that could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. A breach of the covenants under our Credit Agreement could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness to which cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement would permit the lenders under the Credit Agreement to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our guarantors may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Additionally, we may not be able to borrow money from other lenders to enable us to refinance our indebtedness. \nIncreased levels of indebtedness could also create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. \nOur investment in the AVAIL Joint Venture could be materially and adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority over the majority of the strategic and operational decisions of the business, corporate governance matters, and our reliance on our AVAIL Joint Venture partner's financial condition. \nOur On September 30, 2022, we completed a disposition of 60% of the equity of AIS Investment Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \"AVAIL JV\"), which consists of our former AZZ Infrastructure Solutions Segment (excluding AZZ Crowley Tubing) (the \"AIS Business\"), with Fernweh AIS Acquisition LP, a Delaware limited partnership. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, AZZ no longer has a controlling interest in the AVAIL JV, and therefore the AVAIL JV is operating and will continue to operate independently. As the non-controlling interest holder in the AVAIL JV, our influence on all aspects of the AIS Business will continue to diminish. Accordingly, we might not be able to prevent the AVAIL JV from taking actions adverse to our interests in the AVAIL JV. We cannot exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the AIS Business, including, but not limited to, hiring and retaining employees and executive officers, management of and payments into its multiemployer pension plans, governance issues, entering into new markets or exiting existing markets, making certain acquisitions or dispositions, and other material strategic transactions. Each of these cases could create the potential risk of creating operational issues and/or impasses on decisions at the AVAIL JV-level that are not in our best interest. Additionally, investments in joint ventures or partnerships, such as the AVAIL JV, may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third-party is not involved, including the possibility that joint venture partners may become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions to various parties, or otherwise struggle operationally or financially. Disputes between AZZ Inc, and our joint venture partner could result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expense and distract our executive officers and directors from focusing their time and efforts on AZZ Inc.'s business and could result in subjecting the AIS Business to additional risk. \nAny of the foregoing operational risks could materially reduce the expected return of our prior investment in the AVAIL JV and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our securities. \nAdverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with our defined benefit pension plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have a defined benefit pension plan which is frozen with respect to benefits and the addition of participants. The funded status and our ability to satisfy the future obligations of the plan is affected by, among other things, changes in interest rates, returns from plan asset investments, and actuarial assumptions including the life expectancies of the plan’s participants. As of February 28, 2025, the plan was underfunded, and we have a liability of $24.6 million on our consolidated balance sheet. Our ability to adequately fund or meet our future obligations with respect to the plan could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. \nA change in a customer’s creditworthiness could result in significant accounts receivable write-offs.\nAs a normal course of business, we extend credit to certain customers. The amount of credit extended to customers is based upon the due diligence performed, including, but not limited to, the review of the potential customer’s financial statements and banking information. The Company may perform various credit checks and evaluate the customer's previous payment history. While we do not believe we have significant concentration of sales with any one customer, we have certain larger customers and the extension of credit to these customers could result in a significant amount of credit exposure if there is a sudden or severe change in the customer’s creditworthiness. We monitor our outstanding receivables on a regular basis; however, if a customer with large credit exposure is unable to make payment on its outstanding receivables, we could experience a significant write-off of accounts receivable, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nIf our goodwill, definite-lived intangible assets or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, our net income and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles are comprised of certain trade names. We test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually in the fourth quarter, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount. Factors that could indicate that our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired include: a decline in our stock price and market capitalization; lower than projected operating results and cash flows; economic downturns or slower growth rates in our industry; market downturns; or major events such as a global pandemic. Our stock price historically has shown volatility and \noften fluctuates significantly in response to market and other factors. Declines in our stock price, lower operating results and any decline in industry conditions in the future could increase the risk of impairment. The evaluation for impairment includes our estimates of future operating results and cash flows, estimates of allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting segments, estimates of future growth rates, and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used on estimated operating results and cash flows.\nIntangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets are comprised of customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trademarks, technology and certifications. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of their carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by those assets. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, we record impairment losses for the excess of their carrying value over the estimated fair value.\nShould a review indicate impairment, a write-down of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset would occur, resulting in a non-cash charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements, impact our credibility with our shareholders, or impact our relationships with our customers, suppliers or supporting banks.\n We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in the international markets in which we operate.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations related to our operations in Canada. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S dollars, fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar have had and will continue to have an impact on our earnings. A decrease in the value of the Canadian currency relative to the U.S. dollar could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Should we continue to expand geographically, we could experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur operations entail inherent risks that may result in substantial liability. We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities.\nOur manufacturing processes and services provided to our customers entail inherent risks, including defects.  The insurance we carry to mitigate many of these risks may not be adequate to cover future claims or losses. In addition, we are substantially self-insured for workers’ compensation, employer’s liability, property, general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per-incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nTax legislation and administrative initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in locations throughout the U.S. and Canada and, as a result, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, and local governments and the equivalent governmental entities in Canada. From time to time, various legislative or administrative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. In addition, U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Moreover, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make favorably resolving any future tax disputes more difficult. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. Changes to our tax positions resulting from future tax legislation, administrative initiatives or challenges from taxing authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe insurance coverage that we maintain may not fully cover all operational risks.\nWe maintain property, business interruption, casualty and cyber/information security insurance but such insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We may incur losses beyond the limits, or outside the coverage, of our insurance policies, including liabilities for environmental remediation. In the future, the types of insurance we obtain and the level of coverage we maintain may be inadequate or we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAn increase in interest rates would increase interest costs on variable-rate debt and could adversely impact the ability to refinance existing debt. \nAs of February 28, 2025, we have $900.3 million of gross debt outstanding that bears interest at variable rates that reset periodically and are generally based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") or Base Rate, as defined in the Credit Agreement. We utilize interest rate swaps to mitigate the interest rate risk, and we have hedged approximately one-half of our gross debt outstanding with an interest rate swap that expires on September 30, 2025. Approximately one-half of our gross debt outstanding is unhedged. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which could adversely affect cash flow and the ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. In addition, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures. An increase in interest rates could also affect our ability to make new investments on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future, which could affect our financial condition, may decrease our profitability or could dilute our shareholders.\nWe may increase our debt or raise additional equity capital in the future, subject to restrictions in our debt agreements, whether in a private offering or pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which we filed on January 10, 2024. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity-linked securities, the terms of the debt or any shares of common stock or other equity-linked securities issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of any new debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, our current shareholders’ ownership in the Company would be diluted. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial flexibility, which could negatively affect our shareholders.\nGeneral Risks Factors\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n•the inability to meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow our common stock;\n•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our Company relative to other investment alternatives;\n•strategic actions by us or our competitors;\n•Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n•variations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;\n•general economic and stock market conditions;\n•risks relating to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;\n•changes in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;\n•cyber-attacks, terrorist acts or armed hostilities;\n•future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n•repurchases of our outstanding shares; and\n•material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.",
