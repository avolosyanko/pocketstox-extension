      "text": "ITEM 1. Business.\nFor convenience, the terms “Warner Bros. Discovery”, “WBD”, the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to refer to both Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and collectively to Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. and one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.\nIndustry Trends\nThe WGA and SAG-AFTRA went on strike in May and July 2023, respectively, following the expiration of their respective collective bargaining agreements with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (“AMPTP”). The WGA strike ended on September 27, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on October 9, 2023. The SAG-AFTRA strike ended on November 9, 2023, and a new collective bargaining agreement was ratified on December 5, 2023.\nThe strikes had a material impact on the operations and results of the Company in 2023, including a pause on certain theatrical and television productions. Effects included a positive impact on cash flow from operations attributed to delayed production spend, and a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to timing and performance of the 2023 film slate, as well as the Company’s ability to produce, license, and deliver content. The Company experienced content completion and delivery delays in the first quarter of 2024 due to the pause in television and theatrical productions in 2023, but did not experience any material impacts for the remainder of 2024.\nOther headwinds in the industry, such as continued pressures on linear distribution and continued softness in the U.S. linear advertising market, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a material impact on the operations and results of the Company, including a negative impact on the results of operations attributed to declines in linear advertising revenue. In addition, declines in linear subscribers are expected to continue. The increase of digital advertising available in the marketplace has also resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, increased competition for advertising expenditures for both traditional linear networks and ad-supported tiers in streaming services.\nWe continue to closely monitor the ongoing impact of industry trends to our business; however, the full effects on our operations and results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nDescription of Business \nWarner Bros. Discovery is a leading global media and entertainment company that creates and distributes a differentiated and comprehensive portfolio of content and products across television, film, streaming, interactive gaming, publishing, themed experiences, and consumer products through brands including: Discovery Channel, Max, CNN, DC Studios, TNT Sports, HBO, Food Network, TLC, TBS, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, Warner Bros. Television Group, Warner Bros. Games, Adult Swim, Turner Classic Movies, and others.\nWe are home to one of the largest collections of owned content in the world with assets and intellectual property across sports, news, lifestyle, and entertainment in most languages and regions of the globe. We create some of the best-in-class content using our renowned library, beloved franchises, and acclaimed creative expertise to serve our audiences and consumers. Our asset mix strongly positions us to execute our key strategies: grow our direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) business globally, enhance our Studios segment, and manage our linear networks for the best possible success in order to create long-term value for our shareholders.\nWe generate revenue from fees charged to distributors that carry our network brands and programming, including cable, direct-to-home (“DTH”) satellite, telecommunication and digital service providers, as well as through DTC subscription services (distribution revenue); the sale of advertising on our networks and digital platforms (advertising revenue); the release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, the licensing of feature films and television programs to various television, subscription video on demand (“SVOD”) and other digital markets, distribution of feature films and television programs in the physical and digital home entertainment markets, sales of console games and mobile in-game content, sublicensing of sports rights, and licensing of intellectual property such as characters and brands (content revenue); and other sources such as studio tours and production services (other revenue). \nCorporate Reorganization\nOn December 12, 2024, the Company announced that its board of directors had authorized the Company to implement a new corporate structure designed to enhance the Company’s strategic flexibility and create potential opportunities to unlock shareholder value. Under the new corporate structure, the Company will serve as the parent company for two distinct operating divisions: Global Linear Networks and Streaming & Studios. To facilitate the implementation of this new structure and the movement of entities and assets to align with the new operating divisions, on January 1, 2025, the Company completed certain transactions, including (1) a merger of Discovery Holding Company with and into a newly formed subsidiary of WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc. (the “DHC Merger”) and (2) a merger of a second newly formed subsidiary of WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc. with and into Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. (the “Scripps Merger”). As a result of the DHC Merger, Discovery Communications, LLC became an indirect subsidiary of WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc. As a result of the Scripps Merger, Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. became a direct subsidiary of WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc.\nSegments\nAs of December 31, 2024, we classified our operations in three reportable segments: \n•Studios - Our Studios segment primarily consists of the production and release of feature films for initial exhibition in theaters, production and initial licensing of television programs to our networks/DTC services as well as third parties, distribution of our films and television programs to various third party and internal television and streaming services, distribution through the home entertainment market (physical and digital), related consumer products and themed experience licensing, and interactive gaming.\n•Networks - Our Networks segment primarily consists of our domestic and international television networks.\n•DTC - Our DTC segment primarily consists of our premium pay-TV and streaming services.\nOur segment presentation aligns with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make decisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments. Financial information for our segments and the geographical areas in which we do business is set forth in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStudios\nWBD’s Studios business includes the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group (“WBMPG”), DC Studios, Warner Bros. Television Group (“WBTVG”), Consumer Products, Themed Entertainment and Brand Licensing, DC Comics Publishing, Content Licensing, Home Entertainment, Studio Operations, and Interactive Gaming.\nWBMPG is comprised of Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, and Warner Bros. Pictures Animation. WBMPG partners with captivating storytellers to create filmed entertainment for a global audience.\nDC Studios, tasked with developing properties licensed from DC Comics for film, television, animation, and games, continues the tradition of high-quality storytelling within the DC Universe, while building a sustainable growth business out of the iconic characters.\nWBTVG consists of Warner Bros. Television, the Company’s flagship television production unit for live-action scripted programming, as well as Warner Bros. Unscripted Television, which produces unscripted and alternative programming through its four production units – Warner Horizon Unscripted Television, Telepictures, Warner Bros. International Television Production, and Shed Media. WBTVG also includes Warner Bros. Animation, Cartoon Network Studios, and Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe.\nAmong the Studios segment’s content highlights for 2024 were Dune: Part Two, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire on the film side, with Warner Bros. Discovery becoming the first studio to cross the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office that year. Award-winning TV titles for 2024 include Abbott Elementary, Shrinking, and The Voice. As of December 31, 2024, the new series The Penguin remains one of the most-watched debut seasons globally of any current HBO or Max show, behind only House of the Dragon and The Last of Us.\nBeyond its production operations, the Studios segment includes various businesses that facilitate consumer interaction with the intellectual property it creates.\nGlobal Consumer Products, Themed Entertainment and Brand Licensing, and world-renowned comic and publishing powerhouse DC Comics, all drive opportunities for consumers to engage with WBD’s leading entertainment brands and franchises.\nGlobal distribution of most of WBD’s content is handled by Content Sales, which provides content for viewers across streaming, cable, satellite and broadcast networks, local television stations, and airlines. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment oversees the global distribution of content through physical goods (Blu-ray Disc™ and DVD) and digital media in the form of electronic sell-through and video-on-demand via cable, satellite, online, and mobile channels.\nThe Studios segment also includes Warner Bros. Games, a worldwide publisher, developer, licensor, and distributor of content for the interactive space across all platforms, including console, handheld, mobile, and PC-based gaming for both internal and third-party game titles. \nIn September 2024, WBD announced a new global structure for the Company’s worldwide studio tours, retail destinations, touring exhibitions, and all location-based experiences. WBD Global Experiences brings together the previous Global Themed Entertainment licensing group and the Studio Tours & Retail owned and operated group into a single worldwide division to develop and execute on global strategies that offer partners a mix of both group models, putting WBD in a position to drive growth and become a worldwide leader in the creation, development, licensing, and operation of location-based entertainment inspired by Harry Potter, DC, Looney Tunes, Scooby-Doo, Game of Thrones, Friends, Discovery and more.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, content and other revenues were 92% and 8%, respectively, of total revenues for this segment.\nNetworks\nWBD’s linear network operations include general entertainment, lifestyle, and news networks in the U.S., as well as a host of international media networks and global sports networks.\nGeneral and lifestyle entertainment networks in the U.S. include TNT, TBS, Turner Classic Movies, OWN, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Discovery Channel and Adult Swim, among many others.\nIn 2024, CNN, our global news brand, launched CNN International in Europe on Max, giving audiences the ability to access a combination of on-air CNN content and exclusive programming on WBD’s streaming service in Spain, Nordics, Belgium, Netherlands, and Central and Eastern Europe.\nTNT Sports is a global leader in the delivery of premium sports content. The TNT Sports U.S. portfolio includes expansive, multi-platform partnerships with the National Basketball Association (“NBA”), Major League Baseball, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (“NCAA”) Division I Men’s Basketball Championship, National Hockey League, United States Soccer Federation, Unrivaled, National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Roland-Garros, NCAA Big 12 Football and Men’s Basketball, and NCAA Big East Men’s and Women’s Basketball. Additionally, TNT Sports co-manages NCAA.com and NCAA March Madness Live, along with NBA Digital including NBA TV, the NBA App and NBA.com. Bleacher Report and House of Highlights, digital destinations for young adult sports fans, are owned and operated by TNT Sports. In March 2024, TNT Sports also premiered a primetime sports programming block on truTV consisting of live sports, original sports shows, and ancillary sports content.\nTNT Sports in the United Kingdom and Ireland includes live coverage of Australian Open and Roland-Garros tennis; Grand Tour cycling; the Union Cycliste Internationale Mountain Bike World Series; World Championship and World Cup winter sports events; British and World Superbikes; snooker; Olympic Games 2026-2032; Premier League; Union of European Football Associations club football; Premiership men’s and women’s rugby; MotoGP; international cricket; Ultimate Fighting Championship and boxing, which are all available on TNT Sports and its streaming home, discovery+. \nTNT Sports’ owned-and-operated platforms include Bleacher Report, Eurosport.com, House of Highlights, Golf Digest, and a full suite of digital and social brands. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, distribution, advertising, content, and other revenues were 53%, 36%, 9%, and 2%, respectively, of total revenues for this segment.\nDTC\nWBD’s DTC business includes our streaming services, such as Max and discovery+, and premium pay-TV services, such as HBO. Our streaming services are available on most mobile and connected TV devices. As of December 31, 2024, we had 116.9 million DTC subscribers1. Our strong subscriber growth this year has driven increased revenue and profitability for the DTC segment. In 2025 and 2026, we anticipate additional launches of our streaming services in major markets.\nHBO is one of the most respected and innovative entertainment brands in the world, serving iconic, award-winning programming through the HBO linear channels and our DTC streaming service, Max. In 2024, HBO’s crime drama The Penguin earned positive reviews and grew its premiere-night audience by 54% from debut to finale. The Penguin also earned Colin Farrell a Golden Globe Award in the category for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series, or a Motion Picture Made for Television. Another standout was True Detective: Night Country, which became the series’ most watched season, receiving 19 Emmy nominations and one win for Jodie Foster’s performance. New HBO series highlights include Dune: Prophecy and Like Water for Chocolate, both of which have already been renewed for a second season. Other hit HBO series that returned to critical acclaim in 2024 included House of the Dragon and Hacks, a Golden Globe winner for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy.\nMax is a streaming destination for a variety of programming including HBO Originals, Warner Bros. films, Max Originals, the DC universe, the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, CNN, and programming across food, home, reality, lifestyle, and documentaries from leading brands like HGTV, Food Network, Discovery Channel, and more. Our strategy to grow our DTC business globally delivered success in 2024 with the launch of Max in 73 new markets across Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia and the addition of 19.3 million global subscribers to our DTC products. \nIn 2025, our content pipeline for HBO and Max includes the highly anticipated returns of The White Lotus, The Last of Us, Hacks, ...And Just Like That, Peacemaker, and The Gilded Age, as well as the series premieres of It: Welcome to Derry and The Eastern Gate.\ndiscovery+ is WBD’s non-fiction, real-life subscription-based streaming service. discovery+ features a wide range of series across popular passion verticals, including lifestyle and relationships; home and food; true crime; paranormal; adventure and natural history; science, tech, and the environment; and a slate of high-quality documentaries. discovery+ highlights for 2024 included the premiere of Quiet on Set and the return of the Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\nMax and discovery+ currently feature both ad-free and ad-lite versions in most markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, distribution, advertising, and content revenues were 87%, 8%, and 4%, respectively, of total revenues for this segment.\n1  Direct-to-Consumer subscriber - We define a “Core DTC Subscription” as: \n(i) a retail subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product (defined below) for which we have recognized subscription revenue, whether directly or through a third party, from a direct-to-consumer platform; (ii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product for which we have recognized subscription revenue from a fixed-fee arrangement with a third party and where the individual user has activated their subscription; (iii) a wholesale subscription to discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, or a Premium Sports Product for which we have recognized subscription revenue on a per subscriber basis; (iv) a retail or wholesale subscription to an independently-branded, regional product sold on a stand-alone basis that includes discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, and/or a Premium Sports Product, for which we have recognized subscription revenue (as per (i)-(iii) above); and (v) users on free trials who convert to a subscription for which we have recognized subscription revenue within the first seven days of the calendar month immediately following the month in which their free trial expires.\nThe Company defines a “Premium Sports Product” as a strategically prioritized, sports-focused product sold on a stand-alone basis and made available directly to consumers. The current “independently-branded, regional products” referred to in (iv) above consist of TVN/Player and BluTV. Subscribers to multiple WBD DTC products (listed above) are counted as a paid subscriber for each individual WBD DTC product subscription. We may refer to the aggregate number of DTC Subscriptions as “subscribers”.\nThe reported number of “subscribers” included herein and the definition of “DTC Subscription” as used herein excludes: (i) individuals who subscribe to DTC products, other than discovery+, HBO, HBO Max, Max, a Premium Sports Product, and independently-branded, regional products (currently consisting of TVN/Player and BluTV) that may be offered by us or by certain joint venture partners or affiliated parties from time to time; (ii) a limited number of international discovery+ subscribers that are part of non-strategic partnerships or short-term arrangements as may be identified by the Company from time to time; (iii) domestic and international Cinemax subscribers, and international basic HBO subscribers; and (iv) users on free trials except for those users on free trial that convert to a DTC Subscription within the first seven days of the next month as noted above.\nDomestic subscriber - We define a Domestic subscriber as a subscription based either in the United States of America or Canada.\nInternational subscriber - We define an International subscriber as a subscription based outside of the United States of America or Canada.\nCOMPETITION\nProviding content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide. We experience competition for the development and acquisition of content, distribution and sale of our content, sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership. There is competition from other production studios, other television networks, and online-based content providers for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers, producers and directors. In addition, the composition of our competitors has evolved with the entrance of new market participants, including companies in adjacent sectors with significant financial, marketing, and other resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content, attracting viewers and the sale of advertising. Our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience, the distribution of our content, viewership, and the production, marketing and advertising support we provide.\nOur networks compete with other television networks, including broadcast, cable and local, and with other studios and production companies for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators, DTH satellite service providers, and other distributors that carry our content. Our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences. Our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Growth in the number of networks distributed, consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry, and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place. The ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production, acquisition and packaging of content, viewership, the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors, the product offering across a series of networks within a region, and the prices charged for carriage.\nOur networks and streaming services, which include Max, HBO Max, and discovery+, compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks, including broadcast, cable, local networks, other content distribution outlets and new market participants for their target audiences and the sale of advertising. Our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network, the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content, the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by third-party research companies, prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace.\nOur networks, studios and streaming services also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers, including broadcast, cable and local networks, streaming services, pay-per-view and video-on-demand (“VOD”) services, online activities and other forms of news, information and media entertainment.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe are one of the world’s leading creators, owners and distributors of intellectual property. Our intellectual property assets include copyrights in films, television programs, software, comic books and mobile apps; trademarks in names, logos and characters; patents or patent applications for inventions related to products and services; websites; and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds from third parties. We have made and will continue to make investments in developing technology platforms to support our digital products and streaming services, including Max and discovery+, and consider these platforms to be intellectual property assets as well.\nWe are a global media and entertainment company and the protection of our content and brands is of primary importance. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, unfair competition, and internet/domain name statutes and laws, and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories, and new legislative or regulatory initiatives could impact our operations.\nWe seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not be effective. Piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signals, and the unauthorized use of our intellectual property in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property. Piracy also includes the unauthorized use of our intellectual property on physical goods. We have a team dedicated to disrupting and curbing piracy and other forms of intellectual property infringement and use external vendors to detect and remove infringements, whether digital in nature or on physical goods. We also engage with intermediaries that facilitate piracy, leverage our membership in a range of industry groups, and initiate enforcement actions, including litigation, to address piracy issues. In general, policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. Further, new technologies such as generative AI and their impact on our intellectual property rights remain uncertain, and development of the law in this area could impact our ability to protect against infringing uses or result in infringement claims against us.\nThird parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may also result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nOur businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies, such as the E.U., in which we operate. Content networks, such as those owned by us, are regulated in certain limited respects by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), including some regulations that only apply to content networks affiliated with a cable television operator. Other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) operators and other distributors, affect content networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change. These descriptions are summary in nature and describe only the most significant regulations we face; they do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.\nProgram Access\nThe Communications Act (the “Act”) and the FCC’s program access rules prevent a content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable and DBS operators, in the rates, terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of the vendor’s content networks, on the basis of the non-affiliation. These rules permit the unaffiliated MVPD to initiate a complaint to the FCC against the content vendor and content networks if it believes this rule has been violated.\nProgram Carriage\nThe Act and the FCC’s program carriage rules prohibit MVPDs from favoring their affiliated content networks over unaffiliated, similarly situated content networks in the rates, terms and conditions of their carriage agreements in a manner that unreasonably restrains the ability of the unaffiliated content network to compete fairly. These rules permit the unaffiliated content network to initiate a complaint to the FCC against the MVPD if it believes these rules have been violated, but court decisions interpreting the regulations have made it difficult for us to challenge a distributor’s decision to decline to carry one of our content networks or discriminate against one of our content networks.\n“Must-Carry”/Retransmission Consent\nThe Act imposes “must-carry” regulations on cable systems, requiring them to carry, as part of their cable service, the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market if they elect mandatory carriage. DBS systems are also subject to their own must-carry rules. The FCC’s implementation of “must-carry” obligations requires cable operators and DBS providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space and favorable channel positions. This reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our content networks by cable and DBS operators on television. The Act also gives certain broadcasters the choice of opting out of must-carry and invoking the right to retransmission consent, which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require MVPDs, such as cable and satellite operators, to obtain the broadcaster’s consent before distributing the broadcaster’s signal to the MVPDs’ subscribers, often at a substantial cost that reduces the content funds available for programmers not affiliated with broadcasters, such as us.\nAccessibility, Children’s Advertising Restrictions, Emergency Alerts and CALM Act\nCertain of our content networks and some of our IP-delivered video content must provide closed-captioning and audio description of some of their programming and comply with other regulations designed to make our content more accessible to persons with disabilities. The U.S. Congress, the FCC, and the U.S. Department of Justice periodically consider proposals to implement additional accessibility requirements, and are considering a number of such proposals now, some of which would increase our obligations substantially. Our television programming intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on the amount and type of permissible advertising, and certain regulations extend to our digital products when they are referenced by web address in our television programming. We may not include actual or simulated emergency alert tones or signals in our content. Commercials embedded in our networks’ television content stream also must adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material.\nObscenity Restrictions\nMVPDs are prohibited from transmitting obscene content, and our distribution agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks.\nRegulation of Digital Products and Services\nWe operate a variety of free, advertising-based and subscription-based digital products and streaming services providing news, information and entertainment to consumers in the U.S. and international markets via web, mobile and connected TV platforms. In some cases, those products and services are provided directly to consumers, and in other cases, they can be used and/or purchased through a third-party distributor, such as Xfinity or Hulu. Our digital products and services are subject to federal and state laws in the U.S. relating to the privacy and security of personal information collected from our users, including laws pertaining to the acquisition of personal information from children. Some examples of these laws include the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN SPAM), the Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Additional U.S. state and federal laws addressing data security and data breach notification obligations also may apply to the Company in some instances. These laws and their public and private enforcement are continually evolving. More than a dozen comprehensive U.S. state privacy laws have taken effect in the last few years, and a number of others have been introduced and may pass in the future. Additional U.S. federal and state laws and regulations apply or may be adopted with respect to our digital products and services, covering such issues as data privacy and security, the online safety of children and teens, dissemination or moderation of user-generated content, advertising, competition, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. The scope of regulation may differ depending on how these products and services are used and/or purchased. In addition, the FCC from time to time considers whether some or all digital services should be considered MVPDs and regulated as such, or otherwise subjected to rules that apply to traditional communications providers. Such determination would increase our regulatory burdens substantially.\nIntellectual Property Laws and Regulations\nOur intellectual property assets are discussed under “Business – Intellectual Property” above. Our content, whether distributed over broadcast, cable, DBS, wireless, or internet-based services, or through other means, is protected under intellectual property law, including copyright, trademark, patent, unfair competition, and internet/domain name statutes and laws and license agreements. Changes to these laws and regulations could either strengthen or weaken our ability to license and protect our content and combat its theft or misuse.\nForeign Laws and Regulations\nThe foreign jurisdictions in which our products and services are offered have, in varying degrees, laws and regulations governing our businesses, including relating to the production, monetization and distribution of content. By way of example, our digital offerings available to consumers in international jurisdictions are subject to laws and regulations relating to, without limitation, consumer protection, data privacy and security, advertising, competition, intellectual property, and content limitations.\nSimilar to the U.S., new laws and regulations in international jurisdictions may be adopted with respect to our intellectual property, products and services. In particular, we face increased efforts in international jurisdictions to regulate streaming services, which may constrain our offerings. Further, international laws and regulations around intellectual property could limit our ability to license and protect our content, as well as impose additional burdens on our business.\nHUMAN CAPITAL \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 35,000 employees, including full-time and part-time employees of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures, with 50% located in the U.S. and 50% located outside of the U.S.\nWe are a talent-driven business, aiming to attract, develop, and motivate top talent throughout our company. To support these objectives, our people and culture programs are designed to provide competitive, locally-relevant benefits, performance-based pay, and nonfinancial support and incentives. We also strive to enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making our workplace engaging and inclusive, and to develop our talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future. We also provide opportunities for our employees to make an impact in their communities through social good initiatives around the world.\nSome examples of our people and culture programs and initiatives are described below. \nCompensation \nOur compensation philosophy is to pay for performance, encourage excellence and reward employees who innovate and deliver high-quality results.

In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material may also adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive industries and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nThe media and entertainment industries in which we compete for viewers, distribution and advertising are highly competitive. See the discussion under “Business – Competition” that appears above. We face increased competitive pressure for talent, content, audiences, subscribers, service providers, advertising spending and production infrastructure. We compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services, some of whom have interests in multiple media and entertainment businesses that are often vertically integrated, all vying for consumer time, attention and discretionary spending. In addition, the composition of our competitors has evolved with the entrance of new market participants, including companies in adjacent sectors with significant financial, marketing and other resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing. Such competitors could also have preferential access to important technologies, customer data or other competitive information. Our competitors may also consolidate or enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. \nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including our ability to consistently acquire and produce high quality content and our ability to identify and successfully execute strategies and partnerships to distribute our content amidst a rapidly evolving competitive landscape. In addition, new technology, including generative artificial intelligence (“AI”), is evolving rapidly and our ability to compete could be adversely affected if our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that competition in the marketplace will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur advertising revenues have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by several factors, including the changing landscape of television advertising spending and advertising market conditions.\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and a continuing decline in advertising revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nShifting consumer preferences toward streaming services and other digital products and the increasing number of entertainment choices has intensified audience fragmentation and reduced content viewership through traditional linear distribution models. This has changed the landscape of traditional television advertising spending, prompting advertisers to shift their strategies, and ultimately advertising spend, toward streaming services and other digital products to reach target audiences. In addition, a number of other streaming services with larger subscriber bases and greater household penetration have recently introduced ad-supported tiers. The increase of digital advertising available in the marketplace, due to both the introduction of ad-supported tiers in competing streaming services and the expansion of free ad-supported television (“FAST”) products, has increased, and is expected to continue to increase, the competition we face for advertising expenditures for both our traditional linear networks and the ad-supported tiers in our streaming services, and has also limited our ability to demand higher rates for our linear and digital advertising inventory or even the same rates that we previously charged for our advertising inventory prior to the surge in digital advertising. There can be no assurance that we can successfully navigate the evolving streaming and digital advertising market or that the advertising revenues we generate in that market will replace the declines in advertising revenues generated from our traditional linear business.\nThe advertising market is also sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns. Financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries where our content is distributed could adversely affect the spending priorities of our advertising partners who might reduce their spending, which could result in a decrease in advertising rates and volume and in our overall advertising revenues. Natural and other disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could also lead to a reduction in domestic and international advertising expenditures, which could also have an adverse effect on our advertising revenues.\nOur advertising revenues are also dependent on our ability to measure viewership and audience engagement across all platforms and in all geographic regions. Although audience measurement systems have evolved and improved to capture the viewership of programming across multiple platforms, they still do not fully capture all viewership across streaming and other digital platforms and advertisers may not be willing to pay advertising rates based on the viewership that is not being measured. In certain geographic regions, our ability to fully capture viewership information may be limited by local laws and regulations.\nAs further discussed in other parts of this Item 1a. Risk Factors, our ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on our ability to compete in highly competitive, rapidly evolving industries, our ability to respond to changes in consumer behavior and our ability to consistently achieve audience acceptance of our content and brands.\nChanges in consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies and distribution models, may negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behavior and shifting content consumption patterns. The ways in which viewers consume content, and technology and distribution models in the media and entertainment industries, continue to evolve, and new distribution platforms, as well as increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies, have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenues. Technological advancements have empowered consumers to seek more control over how they consume content and have affected the options available to advertisers for reaching target audiences. This trend has impacted certain traditional distribution models, as demonstrated by industry-wide declines in cable ratings, declines in subscribers to the traditional cable bundle, the development of alternative distribution platforms for content, and reduced theatergoing.\nDeclines in linear television viewership are expected to continue and possibly accelerate, which could adversely affect our advertising and distribution revenues. In order to respond to this decline, changing consumer behavior, increasing preferences to consume content on demand, and changes in content distribution models in the media and entertainment industries, we have invested in, developed and launched streaming services including Max and discovery+. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur significant costs to develop and market our streaming services, including costs related to international expansion, technological enhancements, and subscriber acquisition. There can be no assurance, however, that consumers and advertisers will embrace our offerings, that subscribers will activate or renew a subscription, particularly given the significant number of streaming services in the marketplace, or that our DTC business or other strategies we implement will be as successful or as profitable as our traditional linear television business.\nThe film industry has also been impacted by shifting consumer preferences and technological innovation, including, among other things, consumer preferences for viewing movies at home, a vast library of which is available to them through one or more streaming subscriptions, and shorter theatrical release windows. As a response to changing consumer preferences, film studios such as ours can seek to invest in creating compelling films and seek to promote events in connection with feature films in order to enhance the consumer’s movie theater experience. If the film industry (of which we are a part) and exhibitors are unable to successfully create and market “event” films and ultimately evolve and enhance the movie theater experience in response to shifting consumer preferences, the profitability, financial condition and results of operations of our studios business may be negatively impacted.\nEach distribution model has different risks and economic consequences for us, and the rapid evolution of consumer preferences may have an economic impact that is not ultimately predictable. Further, technology in the media and entertainment industries continues to evolve rapidly. For example, AI is a new technology for which the advantages and risks associated with its use in our industry are currently largely uncertain and unregulated. If we are not able to access our targeted audience with appealing category-specific content and adapt to new technologies, distribution methods, platforms and business models, we may experience a decline in viewership and ultimately a decline in the demand for our programming, which could lead to lower distribution and advertising revenues, materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on the acceptance of our content and brands by our U.S. and international viewers, which may be unpredictable and volatile.\nThe production and distribution of television programs, feature films, sports and news content are inherently risky businesses because the revenue we derive and our ability to distribute our content depend primarily on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The appeal, success and performance of our content with consumers, as well as with third-party licensees and other distribution partners, are critical factors that can affect the revenue that we receive with respect to our content-related business. Our success depends on our ability to consistently create and acquire content that meets the changing preferences of viewers in general, in special interest groups, in specific demographic categories and in various international marketplaces. For example, generally, feature films that perform well upon initial release also have commercial success in subsequent distribution channels. Therefore, the underperformance of a feature film, especially an “event” film, upon its theatrical release can result in lower-than-expected revenues for our business which could limit our ability to create future content. We are required to make substantial investments in the production or acquisition and marketing of our television programs, feature films, sports and news content before we learn whether such content will reach anticipated levels of popularity with consumers. Failing to gain the level of audience acceptance we expect for our content may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe commercial success of our content also depends upon the quality and acceptance of competing content available in the applicable marketplace. For example, as some foreign film and filmmaking industries grow and the availability of popular local content rises, the demand from foreign audiences for American films may decrease, which could negatively impact our revenue. Other factors, including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, piracy, and our ability to develop strong brand awareness may also affect the audience demand for our content. Consequently, reduced public acceptance of our television programs, feature films, sports and news content or negative publicity regarding individuals or operations associated with our content or brands may decrease our audience share and customer/viewer reach and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our DTC products fail to attract and retain subscribers, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur Max and discovery+ offerings are subscription-based streaming services and are among many such services in a crowded and highly competitive landscape. Their success and the success of other subscription-based streaming services we may offer in the future will be largely dependent on our ability to initially attract, and ultimately retain, subscribers. If we are unable to effectively market our DTC products or if consumers do not perceive the pricing and related features of our DTC products to be of value versus our competitors, we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers. \nFurther, decreases in consumer discretionary spending in the markets where our DTC products are offered may reduce our ability to attract and retain subscribers to our services, which could have a negative impact on our business. Relatedly, a decrease in viewing subscribers on our advertising-supported DTC products could also have a negative impact on the rates we are able to charge advertisers for advertising-supported services. The ability to attract and retain subscribers will also depend in part on our ability to provide compelling content choices that are differentiated from that of our competitors and that are more attractive than other sources of entertainment that consumers could choose in their free time. Furthermore, our ability to provide a quality subscriber experience and our relative service levels, may also impact our ability to attract and retain subscribers. In addition, from time to time, we have entered into, and may enter into, partnerships to offer our streaming services as part of a bundle with other streaming services, which may not lead to the anticipated financial benefit or growth in subscribers. Even if such bundling partnerships are successful, if we are unable to maintain existing or create new bundling partnerships, our ability to retain subscribers and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\nIf existing subscribers, including those who receive subscriptions through wireless, broadband, or streaming bundling arrangements with third parties or through wholesale arrangements with MVPDs, cancel or discontinue their subscriptions for any reason, including as a result of selecting an alternative wireless or broadband plan that does not bundle our products, canceling or discontinuing their MVPD subscription, or due to the availability of competing offerings that are perceived to offer greater value compared to our DTC products, our business may be adversely affected. We would need to add new subscribers both to replace subscribers who cancel or discontinue their subscriptions and to grow our business. If we are unable to attract and retain subscribers and offset the losses of subscribers who cancel or discontinue their subscriptions to our DTC products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFailure to renew, renewal with less favorable terms, or termination of our content licenses and similar distribution agreements may cause a decline in our revenue.\nBecause our content and pay-TV networks are licensed to and distributed through third parties, such as traditional television and pay-TV broadcasters (such as cable and satellite operators) and operators of digital platforms, which in turn make such content available, directly and indirectly, to consumers, we are dependent upon the maintenance of these licensing and distribution agreements with such third parties. These agreements generally provide for the scope of licensed rights, including geographic territory, exploitation rights, holdbacks and/or other restrictions, including exclusivity or non-exclusivity, window(s) of exploitation (including first and second pay-TV and free to air broadcast), for the level of carriage our networks will receive, such as channel placement and programming package inclusion (widely distributed, broader programming packages compared to lesser distributed, specialized programming packages), and for payment of a license fee to us based on a number of factors, including the scope of the rights granted, the popularity of the content (as measured in the case of films, for example, by box office performance for certain downstream exploitation) and the date of its first theatrical or pay-TV exhibition.\nOur agreements generally have a limited term which varies by territory and distributor, and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future or that they will be renewed on terms that are favorable to us. Whether or not a distributor is willing to renew an agreement on terms that are favorable to us may be dependent upon our decision to make our content available on both our linear networks and our streaming platforms. Failure to renew an agreement prior to its expiration could lead to service blackout, which could in turn affect both our revenues and our reputation with viewers.\nWhile the number of subscribers associated with our networks impacts our ability to generate advertising revenue (as further described elsewhere in this Item 1A), subscription-based revenue also represents a significant portion of our revenue. The license fees and other commercial terms that we receive are dependent, among other factors, on the acceptance and performance of our content with consumers. A reduction in the license fees that we receive or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as a result of a loss or reduction in carriage for our networks or a reduction in distributor penetration, or as a result of changes in consumer habits, could adversely affect our distribution revenue. Such a loss or reduction in carriage could also decrease the potential audience for our programs thereby adversely affecting our advertising revenue. Changes in distribution strategy and variations on traditional theatrical distribution and other licensing models, such as shortening traditional windows, may also drive changes in the license fees that distributors and other downstream licensees in the value chain may be willing to pay for content, which may in turn negatively affect our revenue. As a result of industry consolidation, our distributors have become and may continue to become larger, and as a result have gained or could gain additional market power. Such consolidation gives these distributors leverage in negotiating their distribution agreements with us which could subject our affiliate fee revenue to reduction or discounts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition, content distribution and license agreements are complex and individually negotiated. For example, some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” clauses, which typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another distributor which contains certain more favorable terms, we must offer some of those terms to our existing distributors. If we were to disagree with one of the counterparties on the interpretation of a content distribution and license agreement, it could damage our relationship with that counterparty as well as materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on platforms owned by our competitors for digital and linear distribution of our content.\nWe rely on platforms owned by third parties, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming services, to make our content available to our subscribers and viewers. If these third parties do not continue to provide access to our service on their platforms or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected. If we are not successful in maintaining existing or creating new relationships with these third parties, our ability to retain subscribers and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe invest significant resources to acquire and maintain licenses to produce sports programming and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in our efforts to obtain or maintain licenses to recurring sports events or recoup our investment when the content is distributed.\nWe face significant competition to acquire and maintain licenses to sports programming, which leads to significant expenditure of funds and resources. As a result of an increasing number of market entrants in the programming space, we have seen upward pressure on programming costs in recent years, particularly in connection with the licensing and acquisition of sports content from third parties. We may also be impacted by such upward pressures driven by increasing investment in programming by competitors. In certain international markets, regulations concerning content quotas or content investment requirements may be a further factor driving increasing programming costs. In addition, businesses, including ours, that offer multiple services or that may be vertically integrated and offer both video distribution and programming content, may face closer regulatory review from the competition authorities in the countries in which we currently have operations. If our distributors have to pay higher rates to other holders of sports broadcasting rights, it might be difficult for us to negotiate higher rates for the distribution of our networks. This difficulty could be amplified if we are unable to obtain or maintain licenses for sports programming that we can bundle with our other programming for distribution. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors to obtain and/or maintain licenses to recurring sports events. For example, in 2024, the Company was engaged in a legal dispute, which has since been settled, with the NBA regarding our license to distribute NBA games and NBA-related content. If our licenses to recurring sports events are not renewed, such nonrenewal could limit our ability to negotiate higher rates for the distribution of our networks. Increasing competition for programming licenses and regulatory review from competition authorities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere can also be no assurance that we will recoup our investment in sports programming or that revenue from our content distribution agreements will exceed our costs for the rights for sports programming, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming. The impact of these licenses on our results of operations over the term of the licenses depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets and subscription levels and rates for programming. Our success with sports programming is highly dependent on consumer acceptance of this content and the size of our viewing audience. If viewers do not find our sports programming content acceptable, we could see low viewership, which could lead to low distribution and advertising revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses have been, and in the future may be, subject to labor disruption.\nWe and some of our suppliers and business partners retain the services of writers, directors, actors, announcers, athletes, technicians, trade employees and others involved in the development and production of our television programs, feature films and interactive entertainment (e.g., games) who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the affected unions could take, and have taken, actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns, work stoppages, or the possibility of such actions, including the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes and potential future strikes by other unions involved in development and production, have resulted in, and could in the future result in, delays in the production of, or the release of, our television programs, feature films, and interactive entertainment. For example, the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes caused delays in the production of our television programs and feature films and in the release of certain programming. The impact of these strike-related delays and other consequences of these strikes have continued to impact our business even after the strikes were ultimately resolved.\nIf the media and entertainment industries experience prolonged strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages, we may be unable to produce, distribute or license programming, feature films, and interactive entertainment, which could result in reduced revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes had a material impact on the operations and results of the Company. See the discussion under “Business – Industry Trends” that appears above. In addition, the pausing and restarting of certain productions resulted in incremental costs, delayed the completion and release of some of our content (films, television programs, and licensed programs) and could cause an impairment of our investment in film, television programs, or licensed program rights if the incremental costs are significant or we are unable to efficiently complete the production of the film, television show or program or decide to abandon the production.\nWe may also enter into new collective bargaining agreements or renew collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms and incur higher costs as a result of prolonged strikes, work slowdowns, or work stoppages. Many of the collective bargaining agreements that cover individuals providing services to the Company are industry-wide agreements, and we may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. Union or labor disputes or player lock-outs relating to certain professional sports leagues may preclude us from producing and telecasting scheduled games or events and could negatively impact our promotional and marketing opportunities. Depending on their duration, union or labor disputes or player lock-outs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have recognized, and could continue to recognize, impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), management periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. (See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) The occurrence of certain events or circumstances has resulted in, and could continue to result in, a downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets. For example, continued negative industry or economic trends, including the decline of traditional linear television viewership and linear ad revenues, declining levels of global GDP growth and soft advertising markets in the U.S., disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, execution risk associated with anticipated growth in our DTC products, underperformance of our content, failure to renew content licenses and distribution agreements, including affiliate and sports rights renewals, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, including in connection with restructuring initiatives, divestitures and continued decline in our market capitalization could negatively affect our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units. When events or changes in circumstances such as this occur, we have needed to, and may in the future need to, write down the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we determine that our estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit is below the recorded value of that unit on our balance sheet, we may record a non-cash impairment loss for the goodwill. For example, in 2024, we determined that our estimate of the fair value of our Networks reporting unit was below its recorded value on our balance sheet and we recorded a $9.1 billion pre-tax, non-cash impairment of goodwill. Any charges relating to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.\nWe consider all current information when determining the need for, or calculating, any impairment loss. However, future changes in events or circumstances, such as a continuation or worsening of the current negative industry and economic trends and the other events and circumstances described above, could result in decreases in the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets and require us to record additional impairment losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized.\nService disruptions or the failure of communications satellites or transmitter facilities we rely upon could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on communications satellites and transmitter facilities and other technical infrastructure, including fiber, to transmit programming to affiliates and other distributors. Shutdowns of communications satellites and transmitter facilities or service disruptions will pose significant risks to our operations. Such disruptions may be caused by power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, war, failures or impairments of communications satellites or on-ground uplinks or downlinks or other technical facilities and services used to transmit programming, failure of service providers to meet contractual requirements, or other similar events. If a communications satellite or other transmission means (e.g., fiber) is not able to transmit our programming, or if any material component thereof fails or becomes inoperable, we may not be able to secure an alternative communications path in a timely manner because, among other factors, there are a limited number of service providers and other means available for the transmission of programming, and any alternatives may require lead time and additional technical resources and infrastructure to implement. If such an event were to occur, there could be a disruption in the delivery of our programming, which could harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial, Capital and Corporate Structure\nForecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, the current uncertain economic climate and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (as defined in Note 23 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, “Adjusted EBITDA”), free cash flow and subscriber growth, and other financial and operating data, may differ materially from actual results, including as a result of events outside of our control and other risks and uncertainties described herein. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and may incur additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business and our ability to incur debt, and the use of our funds could be limited by the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our credit agreements and senior notes.\nOur consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2024 was $39,505 million, of which $2,748 million is current. In addition, we have the ability to draw down on a $6.0 billion revolving credit facility in the ordinary course, which would have the effect of further increasing our debt to the extent drawn. We are also permitted, subject to certain restrictions under our existing debt agreements, to obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs. This would have the effect of further increasing our leverage ratio.\nOur loan agreements contain restrictive covenants, as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage ratio and other financial maintenance tests. These covenants and requirements could limit our ability to take various actions, including incurring additional debt, guaranteeing indebtedness and engaging in various types of transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and sales of assets, or to take advantage of other opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business. \nIn addition, our corporate or debt-specific credit rating could be downgraded, which may increase our borrowing costs or subject us to even more restrictive covenants when we incur new debt in the future, which could reduce profitability and diminish operational flexibility. In 2024, S&P and Moody’s revised our ratings outlook from stable to negative in part due to declines in our linear business, including as a result of the weak operating environment for linear networks, and our leverage ratio. Credit rating agencies may continue to review and adjust our ratings or outlook.\nIf we are unable to effectively reduce and sustain our leverage ratio, it could have significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations, including:\n•impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our revolving credit facility or our term loan credit facility or to generate cash sufficient to pay the interest or principal, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt in the event that an uncured default occurs;\n•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and market conditions;\n•limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing;\n•requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes such as capital expenditures, investments, share repurchases, and mergers and acquisitions;\n•requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we compete; and\n•placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\nWe could be unable to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to meet our financial obligations or other commitments.\nOur ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments will depend upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, net cash from the operating activities of our subsidiaries, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments, availability under our credit facilities or any credit facilities that we may obtain in the future and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. The ability of our subsidiaries, including WarnerMedia Holdings, Inc., Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc., and Discovery Communications, LLC to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us will depend on their individual operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions, including restrictions under our credit facilities, to which they may be or may become subject. Under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we were subject to U.S. taxes for the deemed repatriation of certain cash balances held by foreign corporations. The Company intends to continue to permanently reinvest some of these funds outside of the U.S., and current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.\nCorporate restructurings, strategic transactions and acquisitions present many risks and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any transaction.\nFrom time to time we may enter into strategic transactions, make investments or make acquisitions. Our success may depend on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. Such transactions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, use of our cash resources, and incurrence of significant debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. We may also incur unanticipated expenses, fail to realize anticipated benefits, have difficulty integrating the acquired businesses, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, subscribers, affiliates and vendors, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. Additionally, regulatory agencies, such as the FCC or U.S. Department of Justice, may impose additional restrictions on the operation of our business as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any strategic transactions and significant acquisitions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, from time to time we may adjust our corporate structure, reporting and operating segments, or business strategies in connection with significant transactions, changes occurring across an evolving media landscape, macroeconomic conditions and/or other changes related to our business. For example, during fiscal year 2022, in connection with the completion of the acquisition (the “Merger”) in which we acquired the WarnerMedia business (the “WarnerMedia Business”) from AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), we changed our segment presentation and implemented various restructuring and transformation initiatives. During fiscal year 2024, we announced a new corporate structure whereby the Company would reorganize into two distinct operating divisions, anticipated to be implemented during 2025. Such changes could incur unforeseen costs and disruptions, are subject to execution risk, and may not produce the anticipated benefits.\nCertain of our businesses are conducted through joint ventures or partnerships with one or more third parties, in which we share ownership, management, and profits of the business operation to varying degrees.\nCertain of our businesses are conducted through joint ventures or partnerships with one or more third parties, where we have varying degrees of ownership and influence. From time to time, we may disagree with our joint venture partners on the strategy or management of a joint venture business but may be constrained in our ability to make decisions unilaterally as a result of legal or contractual obligations to our joint venture partners, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe our relationship with our third-party partners is an important factor in the success of any joint venture or partnership. If a partner changes, our relationship may be adversely affected and we may not realize the anticipated benefits from such joint venture or partnership.\nWe have directors who also serve as directors of Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty Media”), Liberty Global Ltd. (“Liberty Global”), Qurate Retail, Inc. f/k/a Liberty Interactive Corporation (“Qurate Retail”), Liberty Broadband Corporation (“Liberty Broadband”), and Liberty Latin America Ltd. (“LLA”), which may lead to conflicting interests for those directors or result in the diversion of business opportunities or other potential conflicts.\nDr. John C. Malone, chairman of Liberty Media, Liberty Global and Liberty Broadband and member of the board of directors of Qurate Retail, serves on our board of directors. Our board of directors also currently includes two other persons who serve on the board of directors of Liberty Global and the board of directors of LLA. Liberty Media, Liberty Global, Qurate Retail, and Liberty Broadband, LLA (together, the “Liberty Entities”) own interests in various U.S. and international media, communications and entertainment companies, such as Charter Communications, Inc., that directly or indirectly own or operate domestic or foreign content services that may compete with the content services we offer. We have no rights in respect of U.S. or international content opportunities developed by or presented to any of the Liberty Entities or their respective subsidiaries, and the pursuit of these opportunities by any of the Liberty Entities or their respective subsidiaries may adversely affect our interests and those of our stockholders.\nNone of the Liberty Entities own any interest in us. Dr. Malone beneficially owns: shares of Liberty Media representing approximately 48% of the aggregate voting power of its outstanding stock, shares representing approximately 30% of the aggregate voting power of Liberty Global, shares representing approximately 6% of the aggregate voting power of Qurate Retail, shares representing approximately 48% of the aggregate voting power of Liberty Broadband and shares representing less than 1% of our outstanding common stock. Our other directors who are also directors of the Liberty Entities hold stock and stock-based compensation in the Liberty Entities and hold our stock and stock-based compensation. These ownership interests and/or business positions could create conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and/or one or more of the Liberty Entities. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when we, on the one hand, or one or more of the Liberty Entities, on the other hand, consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for the other.\nThe members of our board of directors have fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders. Likewise, those persons who serve in similar capacities at a Liberty Entity have fiduciary duties to those companies. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both respective companies, and there can be no assurance that the terms of any transactions will be as favorable to us or our subsidiaries as would be the case in the absence of a conflict of interest.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if such acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n•authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n•classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms until the election of directors at our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;\n•limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n•prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring stockholder action to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n•establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n•the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, under our charter, we have not opted out of the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and we are therefore governed by Section 203. Accordingly, it is expected that Section 203 will have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions that our board of directors does not approve in advance and that Section 203 may discourage takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of WBD capital stock.\nThese provisions are intended to protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. As noted above, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, if our board of directors determines that a potential business combination transaction is not in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, but certain stockholders believe that such a transaction would be beneficial to us and our stockholders, such stockholders may elect to sell their shares in WBD and the market price of WBD common stock could decrease.\nRisks Related to Domestic and Foreign Laws and Regulations; Other Risks Related to International Operations\nChanges in domestic and foreign laws and regulations and other risks related to international operations could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProgramming services like ours, and the distributors of our services, including cable operators, satellite operators and other multi-channel video programming distributors, are regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC, as well as by state and local governments, in ways that affect the daily conduct of our video content business. These laws and regulations are constantly subject to change. Current obligations and regulations, among other things, require closed captioning of programming for the hearing impaired, require certain content providers to make available audio descriptions of programming for the visually impaired, impose other accessibility requirements, and limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown during programming aimed primarily at an audience of children aged 12 and under. See the discussion under “Business – Regulatory Matters” that appears above. The U.S. Congress, the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), U.S. state legislatures, and the courts currently have under consideration, and may adopt or interpret in the future, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations of our U.S. media properties or modify the terms under which we offer our services and operate. Additionally, certain Executive Orders from the U.S. government could affect our business, operations, strategies, and increase our costs of compliance. \nIn addition, we distribute programming outside the U.S. As a result, our business is, and may increasingly be, subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:\n•laws and policies affecting trade and taxes, including tariffs and laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;\n•local regulatory requirements (and any changes to such requirements), including restrictions on content, censorship, imposition of local content quotas, local production levies and investment obligations, and restrictions or prohibitions on foreign ownership, outsourcing, consumer protection, targeted advertising, intellectual property and related rights, including copyright and rightsholder rights and remuneration;\n•our ability to obtain the appropriate licenses and other regulatory approvals we need to distribute content in foreign countries as well as regulatory intervention on how we currently operate, including how we license and distribute content;\n•differing degrees of protection for intellectual property and varying attitudes towards the piracy of intellectual property;\n•foreign exchange regulations, or significant fluctuations in foreign currency value and foreign exchange rates, as further described below in this Item 1A;\n•capital, currency exchange and central banking controls;\n•the instability of foreign economies and governments;\n•the potential for political, social, or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities, cyber-attacks or war, including the ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East;\n•anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations and changes in these laws and regulations;\n•sanction laws and regulations such as those administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control that restrict our dealings with certain sanctioned countries, territories, individuals and entities; these laws and regulations are complex, frequently changing, and increasing in number, and may impose additional prohibitions or compliance obligations on our dealings in certain countries and territories, including sanctions imposed on Russia and certain Ukrainian territories as well as sanctions imposed on China;\n•challenges implementing effective controls to monitor business activities across our expanded international operations;\n•restrictions on transfers of personal data under foreign privacy and data protection laws and U.S. national security regulations, including the Preventing Access to U.S. Sensitive Personal Data and Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern or Covered Persons Rule issued by the U.S. Department of Justice;\n•foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations and changes in these laws and regulations; and\n•shifting consumer preferences regarding the viewing of video programming and consumption of entertainment content overall.\nEvents or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenues from non-U.S. sources as well as our costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, some foreign markets where we and our partners operate may be more adversely affected by current economic conditions than the U.S. We also may incur substantial expense as a result of changes, including the imposition of new restrictions, in the existing regulatory, economic or political environment in the regions where we do business.\nThe evolving regulatory environment in international markets may also impact strategy, costs and results of operations, including with respect to local programming levies and investment obligations, satisfaction of local content quotas, access to local production incentive schemes, and direct and indirect digital taxes or levies on internet-based programming services.\nWe are subject to domestic and international privacy and data protection laws, which impact our ability to collect and use personal information. Our efforts to comply with such laws, which are continually evolving, could impose costly obligations on us and generate additional regulatory and litigation risk.\nWe are subject to domestic and international laws associated with the acquisition, storage, disclosure, use and protection of personal data, including under the European General Data Protection Regulation, more than a dozen U.S. federal and state privacy laws, including, but not limited to, the CCPA, and many other international laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are continually evolving and many more U.S. state and federal laws and international laws may pass this year and over the next few years. See the discussion above in “Business – Regulatory Matters”. These evolving privacy, security, and data protection laws may require us to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures, and our actual or alleged failure to comply with such laws could result in legal claims, regulatory enforcement actions and significant fines and penalties.\nEnvironmental, social and governance laws, and regulations may adversely impact our businesses.\nU.S. regulators, international regulators, investors, consumers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance considerations. For example, domestic and international laws and regulations relating to environmental, social and governance matters, including environmental sustainability and climate change, human capital management, AI, and cybersecurity, are under consideration or have been adopted. Many such laws, including the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the greenhouse gas emission regulations that have already been adopted in the state of California and that have been proposed in other jurisdictions, include specific, quantitative disclosures regarding our global operations, both upstream and downstream. These increased disclosure obligations have required and may continue to require us to implement new practices and reporting processes, and have created and may continue to create additional compliance risk. They may also result in increased costs relating to tracking, reporting and compliance.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to live up to evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards for environmental, social and governance issues, or if we are perceived by consumers, stockholders or employees to have not responded appropriately with respect to these issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell our products and services, could be negatively impacted. If, as a result of their assessment of our position on environmental, social, and governance matters, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions, they may reconsider their investment in the Company. Providers of debt and equity financing may also consider our position on these issues and the ratings of external firms (which we have limited ability to influence) in their decisions involving the Company, which could impact our cost of capital and adversely affect our business.\nForeign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions.\nWe have significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of our operations are conducted and certain of our debt obligations are denominated in foreign currencies. The value of these foreign currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we have exposure to foreign currency risk as we enter into transactions and make investments denominated in multiple currencies. Adverse business performance and financial results from unforeseen changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult for us to obtain future financing, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions. Where appropriate, we manage our exposure to foreign currency risk by entering into derivative instruments with counterparty banks, which exposes us to counterparty credit risk.\nOur consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. This exposure to exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and net asset balances.\nIncreasing complexity of global tax policy and regulations could increase our tax liability and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe continue to face the increasing complexity of operating a global business, and we are subject to ever-changing tax policy and regulations around the world. Many foreign jurisdictions are contemplating additional taxes and/or levies on over-the-top services, as well as on media advertising. Other changes in tax laws and the interpretations thereof, or the enactment of new tax legislation in the U.S. or abroad, could have a material impact on our tax liability. In addition, many foreign jurisdictions have increased scrutiny and have either changed, or plan to change, their international tax systems due to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations. These recommendations include, among other things, profit reallocation rules and a 15% global minimum corporate income tax rate. Certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries are expected to introduce legislation, to implement these recommendations. The application of this legislation is evolving, and we continue to assess the potential impact on our future tax liability.\nAdditional complexity has also arisen with respect to state aid; i.e., state resources used to provide recipients an advantage on a selective basis that has or could distort competition and affect trade between European member states. In recent years the European Commission has increased their scrutiny of state aid and has deviated from historical E.U. state aid practices. We receive material amounts of financial incentives for conducting our content production activities in various jurisdictions that offer such incentives. If the E.U. were to restrict our ability to receive these incentives, such restrictions could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition and Integration of the WarnerMedia Business\nOur efforts to operate as Warner Bros. Discovery following the integration of the legacy Discovery business and the WarnerMedia Business, continue to evolve due to the complicated nature of a business such as ours and the highly competitive, rapidly changing media industry. We may incur incremental, unforeseen costs, execution risks, and operational challenges, including those related to new operational systems and shifting priorities across business units, and the amount and timing of any such costs or challenges could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn April 8, 2022, we completed the Merger in which we acquired the business, operations and activities that constituted the WarnerMedia Business of AT&T. Following the Merger, the size and complexity of the business of the combined Company increased significantly and we have undertaken considerable integration activities since that time. We have incurred significant costs following the closing of the Merger, including costs relating to organization restructuring, facility consolidation activities and other contract termination costs, which costs we believe were necessary to realize the anticipated cost synergies from the Merger. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to manage the expanded business of the combined Company following the Merger, in a highly competitive, rapidly changing industry, which could pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of diverse, complex operations and associated increased costs. To support the complex operations of the combined Company, we continue to implement integration initiatives, including integrating and enhancing the businesses’ administrative, accounting and information technology infrastructure and continuing to align and expand the geographic footprint of the DTC products for global customers. We have also announced plans to implement a reorganization of our corporate structure during 2025 to better align the combined Company with our strategic and operational objectives. Such integration and reorganization activities could result in business disruption or unexpected issues, higher than expected costs and an overall process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Even if the integration and reorganization are completed successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be achieved or sustained by the combined Company. All of these factors could materially adversely affect our stock price, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have been engaged in legal proceedings and disputes related to the Merger and could be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes related to the Merger, the outcomes of which are uncertain and could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the Merger, multiple putative class action lawsuits relating to the Merger were filed on behalf of stockholders of the Company against the Company and/or certain of our directors, executive officers and large stockholders seeking damages and other relief, and we have been engaged in other disputes arising out of definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger. Additional lawsuits relating to the Merger, including claims for indemnification by other defendants in lawsuits relating to the Merger, or disputes arising out of definitive agreements entered into in connection with the Merger, could arise in the future. The outcomes of Merger-related lawsuits and disputes are uncertain and could negatively and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we ultimately prevail in a lawsuit or dispute, defending against the claim or resolving the dispute could be time-consuming and costly and divert our management’s attention and resources away from our business, which could negatively and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risks\nTheft of our intellectual property, unauthorized duplication, distribution and exhibitions of our intellectual property, and other impairments of our intellectual property rights may decrease revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends in part on effective and deterrent laws efficiently implemented by law enforcement to enable our ability to maintain and enforce the intellectual property rights underlying our content and brands. We are a global media and entertainment company, and piracy or other infringement of our intellectual property (including digital content, feature films, television programming, gaming, and other content), brands and other intellectual property has the potential to materially adversely affect us. Piracy is particularly prevalent in parts of the world that do not effectively enforce intellectual property rights and laws. Even in territories like the U.S. that have stronger intellectual property laws, legal frameworks that are unresponsive to modern realities, combined with the lack of effective technological prevention and enforcement measures, may impede our enforcement efforts. Our enforcement activities depend in part on third parties, including technology and platform providers, whose cooperation and effectiveness cannot be assured to any degree. In addition, technological advances that allow the almost instantaneous unauthorized copying and downloading of content into digital formats without any degradation of quality from the original facilitate the rapid creation, transmission, and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies. This is also true for broadcast signals, which can be retransmitted without any degradation of quality from the original via unauthorized services. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material over the internet is a threat to copyright owners’ ability to maintain the exclusive control over their copyrighted material and thus the value of their property. The proliferation of unauthorized use of our content may have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability. For example, it may reduce the revenue that we potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content. We may also need to spend significant amounts of money on improvement of technological platform security and enforcement activities, including litigation, to protect our intellectual property rights. Further, new technologies such as generative AI and their impact on our intellectual property rights remain uncertain, and development of the law in this area could impact our ability to protect against infringing uses or result in infringement claims against us.\nAdditionally, any impairment of our intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign laws, the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, or the inability to negotiate license or distribution agreements with third parties, could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a global company, we are subject to laws in the U.S. and abroad, as well as trade agreements which may limit our ability to exploit our intellectual property. For example, in certain countries, including China, laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year.\nFurther, from time to time, third parties may also challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property and may assert infringement claims against us, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nOur success depends on attracting, developing, motivating and retaining key employees and creative talent within our business. Significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention, or failure to adequately motivate or compensate employees or creative talent, could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals.\nAttracting, developing, motivating and retaining talented employees are essential to the successful delivery of our products and services and success in the marketplace. Our business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our corporate and divisional executive teams and entertainment personalities, and the ability to attract and retain these talented employees and personalities is critical in the development and delivery of products and services, which is an integral component of our growth strategy. Competition for employees and personalities can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and reward our current employees, we may not be able to retain them. If we are unable to retain these employees or attract new employees in the future, our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, following the Merger, we have undertaken a number of restructuring and transformation initiatives, including headcount reduction. This headcount reduction and other restructuring initiatives could disrupt our operations, adversely impact employee morale and our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to retain existing employees and hire new employees in the future, distract management and harm our business overall.\nIn addition, we employ or contract with talent who may have loyal audiences. These individuals are important to audience endorsement of our programs and other content. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or retain their current audiences. If we fail to retain or attract key individuals or if our talent loses their current audience base or suffer negative publicity, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face cybersecurity and related risks, which could lead to the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our programming services, damage to our brands and reputation, legal liabilities, and financial losses.\nWe and our partners rely on various technology systems, including cloud services, content delivery, and other networks, in connection with the production, distribution and broadcast of our programming, and our online, mobile and app offerings, as well as our internal systems, involve the storage and transmission of personal and proprietary information. We are subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification, or intentional or accidental release or loss of business or personal data or content maintained in our or our service providers’ systems, including personal and proprietary information of third parties, employees and users of our online, mobile and app offerings, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Additionally, remote access to our networks and systems and the networks and systems of our partners is substantial and may cause such networks and systems to be more vulnerable to cyberattacks or incidents.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, cyber criminals and other malicious actors consistently target us and our service providers. Our systems and our service providers’ systems have been breached in the past due to cybersecurity attacks. These systems may continue to be breached in the future due to employee error or misconduct, system vulnerabilities, malicious code, hacking and phishing attacks, malware, ransomware, or otherwise. In addition, despite efforts to detect cyber breaches,\ncybersecurity attacks can persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and following detection, it may take\nconsiderable time to understand the nature, scope, impact and timing of the cyberattack. The risk of cyberattacks may continue to increase as technologies evolve and cyber criminals conduct their attacks using more sophisticated methods, including those which use AI. We may be unable to anticipate these methods and implement adequate preventative measures. \nThe risk of cyberattacks has also increased and is expected to continue to increase in connection with geopolitical events and dynamics, including ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and tensions with Russia, China, North Korea, Iran and other states. State-sponsored parties or their supporters may launch retaliatory cyberattacks, and may attempt to cause supply chain disruptions, or carry out other geopolitically motivated retaliatory actions that may adversely disrupt or degrade our operations and may result in data compromise. In addition, our high-profile sports and entertainment programming and extensive news coverage of elections, sociopolitical events and public controversies may subject us to heightened cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity threats originate from a wide variety of sources/malicious actors, including, but not limited to, persons who constitute an insider threat, who are involved with organized crime, or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Malicious actors have attempted to, and may continue to attempt to, fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data systems or that of our service providers, customers or clients through social engineering, phishing, mobile phone malware, account takeovers, SIM card swapping, or similar methods.\nWe have implemented processes, strategies and incident response plans designed to identify, assess and manage cyber risks and information security vulnerabilities (as further described in Item 1C. Cybersecurity). However, our procedures may not be sufficient to adequately mitigate the negative impacts of a cyber breach or adverse event and we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any losses that may occur. If our or our service providers’ information security systems or data are compromised, such compromises could result in a disruption of services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services, damage to our brands and reputation, a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services, and significant legal, regulatory and financial exposure, each of which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to a number of legal claims, regulatory investigations, litigation actions (asserted individually and/or on behalf of a class), and/or arbitration proceedings, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries, including, at any particular time, claims relating to antitrust, intellectual property, employment, wage and hour, consumer privacy, regulatory and tax proceedings, contractual and commercial disputes, and the production, distribution, and licensing of our content. We also spend substantial resources complying with various government standards, including any related investigations and litigation. We may incur significant expenses defending such suits or government charges and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. This could result in an increase in our cost for defense or settlement of claims or indemnification obligations if we were to be found liable in excess of our historical experience. Even if we believe a claim is without merit, and/or we ultimately prevail, defending against the claim could be time-consuming and costly and divert our management’s attention and resources away from our business.\nIn addition, our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all significant expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal economic conditions and other global events may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and levels of consumer discretionary spending. A downturn in global economic conditions may negatively affect our current and potential customers, particularly advertisers whose expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions, vendors and others with whom we do business and their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. For example, the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government on imported goods and any retaliatory tariffs from foreign governments could result in increased costs and uncertainty that negatively affect global economic conditions and activity. In addition, inflationary conditions or an increase in price levels generally increases our content production costs and other costs of doing business, which could negatively affect our profitability. Further, a high interest rate environment, whether arising out of a policy response to inflationary conditions or otherwise, increases the costs of our securitization portfolio, which may also negatively affect our results of operations.\nDecreases in consumer discretionary spending in the U.S. and other countries where our content is distributed may cause a decrease in cable television subscriptions, subscriptions to our DTC products, or movie theater attendance to view our feature films, among others, all of which may negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIn addition, our business and operations has been, and in the future could be, disrupted or impacted by other global events, including political, social, or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities, natural disasters such as earthquakes, or pandemics. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic had numerous effects on our business including a decrease in advertising revenues, a postponement of significant live events, and reduced movie theater attendance. Other global events in the future could disrupt our business and operations in unpredictable ways.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and may continue to be volatile due, in part, to circumstances beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation: \n•actual or anticipated variations in our financial and operating results;\n•changes in our estimates, guidance or business plans;\n•variations between our actual results and expectations of securities analysts, or changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n•market sentiment about our industry in general or our business in particular, including our level of debt, our leverage ratio, credit ratings, and our ability to effectively compete in the categories and industries in which we operate;\n•sales of our stock in the public market by our stockholders, some of whom, together with their affiliates, hold large amounts of our stock;\n•the activities, operating results or stock price of our competitors, or other industry participants;\n•spending on domestic and foreign television and digital advertising;\n•the announcement or completion of significant transactions by us or a competitor;\n•overall general market fluctuations and other events affecting the stock market generally; and\n•the economic and political conditions in the U.S. and internationally, as well as other factors described in this Item 1A.\nSome of these factors may adversely impact the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Further, volatility in the price of our common stock may negatively impact our business, including by limiting our financing options for acquisitions and other business expansion.\nOur participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans could subject us to liabilities that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe contribute to various multiemployer defined benefit pension plans (the “multiemployer plans”) under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover certain of our union-represented employees which could subject us to liabilities in certain circumstances. The amount of funds we may be obligated to contribute to multiemployer plans in the future cannot be estimated, as these amounts are based on future levels of work of the union-represented employees covered by the multiemployer plans, investment returns and the funding status of such plans. As of December 31, 2024, we were an employer that provided more than 5% of total contributions to certain of the multiemployer plans in which we participate. If we choose to stop participating or substantially reduce participation in certain of these plans, we may be subject to a withdrawal liability. In addition, actions taken by any other participating employer that lead to a deterioration of the financial health of a multiemployer plan may result in the unfunded obligations of the multiemployer plan being borne by its remaining participating employers, including us. To the extent a multiemployer plan is underfunded or in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status, additional required contributions and benefit reductions may apply. We currently contribute to multiemployer plans that are underfunded, and, as such, under federal law we may be subject to substantial liabilities in the event of a complete or partial withdrawal from, or a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal from, or termination of, such plans. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to liabilities in the future due to the foregoing or other circumstances that may arise in connection with these plans or that we can adequately mitigate these costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.",
