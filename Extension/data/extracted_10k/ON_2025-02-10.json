      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nON Semiconductor Corporation, together with its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries, which operate under the onsemiTM brand (\"onsemi,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" or the \"Company\"), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1992. \nWe provide intelligent power and intelligent sensing solutions with a primary focus towards automotive and industrial markets to help our customers solve challenging problems and create cutting-edge products for a better future. We are utilizing our extensive range of power technologies to help address the growing power demands of AI and data centers. Our intelligent power technologies enable the electrification of the automotive industry that allows for lighter and longer-range electric vehicles, empowers efficient fast-charging systems and propels sustainable energy for the highest efficiency solar strings and industrial power. Our intelligent power solutions for the automotive industry allow our customers to exceed range targets with lower weight and reduce system cost through efficiency. Our intelligent sensing technologies support the next generation industry, allowing for smarter factories and buildings while also enhancing the automotive mobility experience with imaging and depth sensing that make advanced vehicle safety and automated driving systems possible.\nWe believe the evolution of the automotive industry, with advancements in autonomous driving, ADAS, vehicle electrification, and the increase in electronics content for vehicle platforms, is reshaping the boundaries of transportation. Through sensing integration, we believe our intelligent power solutions achieve superior efficiencies compared to our peers. This integration allows lower temperature operation and reduced cooling requirements while saving costs and minimizing weight. In addition, our power solutions deliver power with less die per module, achieving higher range for a given battery capacity. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we were organized into three operating and reportable segments: the Power Solutions Group (\"PSG\"), the Analog and Mixed-Signal Group (\"AMG\") and the Intelligent Sensing Group (\"ISG\"). During the first quarter of 2024, we reorganized the existing divisions within certain of our operating and reportable segments and renamed the Advanced Solutions Group (\"ASG\") reportable segment to AMG. See Note 3: ''Segments and Revenue'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the segment reorganization. \nBusiness Strategy Developments\nOur primary focus continues to be on revenue growth with stable gross margin by capturing high-growth megatrends in our focused end-markets of automotive and industrial infrastructure. We design products in highly-differentiated markets focused on customer needs while optimizing and right-sizing our manufacturing footprint to support growth with new product development and maintain gross margins through efficiencies. We are focused on achieving efficiencies in our operating and capital expenditures, capital allocation on research and development investments and resources to accelerate growth in high-margin products.\n2025 Acquisition\nOn January 14, 2025, we completed the previously announced acquisition of the Silicon Carbide Junction Field-Effect Transistor (\"SiC JFET\") technology business from Qorvo US, Inc., and certain of its subsidiaries, for $118.8 million in cash, subject to working capital adjustments. We believe the acquisition complements our EliteSiC power portfolio within the PSG reportable segment and enables us to help address the need for high energy efficiency and power density in the AC-DC stage in power supply units for AI data centers. \n2024 Activities\n2024 Business Realignment\nIn an effort to streamline resources, drive organizational efficiencies, consolidate our global corporate footprint, and align with our \"Fab Right\" manufacturing strategy, we continued our business realignment efforts during 2024. Under this plan, approximately 1,200 employees were notified of their employment termination and around 300 additional employees were reassigned or asked to relocate to another site. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded severance costs, asset impairments and other related charges of approximately $75.7 million, $37.8 million and $16.3 million, respectively. See Note 7: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, net'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information. We continue to evaluate employee positions and locations for \n 5\n\n\npotential operating improvements and efficiencies.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased approximately 9.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $650 million, which excludes fees, commissions and excise taxes. See Note 10: ''Earnings Per Share and Equity'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.\n2023 Activities\n2023 Business Realignment\nDuring 2023, we realigned our operating models in AMG (formerly \"ASG\"), Corporate information technology (\"IT\") organization and certain manufacturing locations in order to streamline our operations, achieve organizational efficiencies and consolidate resources into fewer, common sites across the world to align with the next phase of our multi-year \"Fab Right\" manufacturing strategy. Under this plan, approximately 1,900 employees were notified of their employment termination. We incurred severance costs and related charges of approximately $59.1 million related to these actions in 2023. See Note 7: ''Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges, net'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information. \n1.625% Notes maturity and repayment\nOn October 16, 2023, we repaid $119.6 million of the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 1.625% Notes in cash and settled the excess over the principal amount by issuing 4.5 million shares of our common stock. Under the previously executed bond hedge agreements, we also repurchased an equivalent number of shares of our common stock, for no additional consideration, to effectively offset the issuance of shares.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 22, 2023, we entered into a new Credit Agreement to replace the Revolver due 2024, which was set to mature on June 28, 2024. We drew $375.0 million against the Revolving Credit Facility and repaid the entire outstanding balance under the Revolver due 2024. We had previously repaid $125.0 million of the outstanding balance under the Revolver due 2024 during the first quarter of 2023. \n0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029\nOn February 28, 2023, we completed the offering of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% Notes and utilized the net proceeds along with cash generated from operations (i) to repay $1,086.0 million of the outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan “B” Facility and the related transaction fees and expenses, (ii) to pay $171.5 million net cost of the related convertible note hedges after such costs were offset by the proceeds from the sale of warrants, and (iii) for general corporate purposes.\nSee Note 9: ''Long-Term Debt'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.\n2022 Acquisitions and Divestitures\nOn December 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of EFK along with certain other assets and liabilities from GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc. (\"GFUS\") for total consideration of $406.3 million. We paid GFUS $236.3 million, $100.0 million and $70.0 million during 2023, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDuring 2022, in line with our \"Fab Right\" strategy, we divested four wafer manufacturing facilities in Oudenaarde, Belgium, South Portland, Maine, Pocatello, Idaho and Niigata, Japan. We entered into wafer supply agreements with the respective buyers of these facilities to help minimize disruptions in our ability to meet customer demand for our products. \nSee Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.\n 6\n\n\nRevenue-Generating Activities\nonsemi generates revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products to distributors and direct customers. We also generate revenue, to a much lesser extent, from product development agreements and manufacturing services provided to customers. We believe that our ability to offer a broad range of products, combined with our global manufacturing and logistics network, provides our customers with single source purchasing. In 2025, we expect to include SiC JFET in our product portfolio within the PSG segment.\nThe following table illustrates the product technologies under each of our segments based on our operating strategy:\n\n                        PSG                           AMG                                 ISG                                    \n2024 Revenue (%)        47%                           37%                                 16%                                    \n                        SiC products                  Analog products                     Actuator Drivers                       \n                        Discrete products             ASIC products                       CMOS image sensors                     \n                        MOSFET products               Logic and Isolation products        Image Signal Processors                \n                        Power Module products         Non-Volatile Memory products        Single Photon Detectors                \n                                                      Foundry products/services           Short-Wavelength Infrared products     \n                                                      Gate Driver products                Indirect Time of Flight sensors        \n                                                      LSI products                                                               \nSee Note 3: ''Segments and Revenue'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for other information regarding our segments, their revenue and gross profit derived from each segment.\nProducts and Technology\nThe following provides certain information regarding the products and technologies for each of our operating segments. \nPSG\nPSG offers a wide array of discrete, module and integrated semiconductor products that perform multiple application functions, including power switching, signal conditioning, and circuit protection.

Because some of our components include functionality that in some cases may be integrated into more complex ICs, we also face competition from manufacturers of ICs, ASICs and fully-customized ICs, as well as customers who develop their own IC products. See \"Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for additional information.\nSome of our competitors have greater financial and other resources to pursue development, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products and may generally be better situated to withstand adverse economic or market conditions. The semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. The following discusses the effects of competition on our three operating segments:\nPSG\nOur competitive strengths include core competencies such as leading-edge fabrication technologies, micro and module packaging expertise, breadth of product line and IP portfolio, high-quality, cost-effective manufacturing and supply chain management. Our commitment to continuous innovation allows us to provide a broad range of semiconductor solutions to our customers who differentiate in power density and power efficiency, the key performance characteristics driving our markets.\nNew products and package innovation that enable enhanced performance over existing portfolios drive competition. Of particular importance in the onsemi portfolio are the intelligent power technologies based on silicon and silicon carbide, wide band gap technologies, which we use to design, manufacture, and deliver to our customers as bare die, packaged discrete solutions or power module solutions. In addition to our power technologies, we believe our integrated circuit, signal and protection technologies have significant performance advantages over our competition. PSG’s primary competitors include: \n 9\n\n\nInfineon Technologies AG (\"Infineon\"), STMicroelectronics N.V.

Generally, prices and quantities are fixed at the time of booking. Backlog as of a given date consists of existing orders and forecasted demand from our customers, in each case scheduled to be shipped in the current or future period. Backlog is influenced by several factors, including market demand, pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times. In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect changes in customer needs. \nResources\nRaw Materials\nOur manufacturing processes use many raw materials, including silicon wafers, SiC wafers, laminate substrates, gold, copper, lead frames, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases, as well as other production supplies used in our manufacturing processes. We seek to obtain our raw materials and supplies in a timely, planned manner from our suppliers to allow for our manufacturing cycle to align with the timing of our customer demands. However, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors beyond our control. \n 10\n\n\nManufacturing and Design Operations\nWe currently have domestic design operations in Arizona, California, Idaho, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas. We also have foreign design operations in Belgium, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Romania, Singapore, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. We operate front-end wafer fabrication facilities in the United States, the Czech Republic, Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia and back-end assembly and test site facilities in Canada, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and the United States. In addition to these front-end and back-end manufacturing operations, our facility in Hudson, New Hampshire manufactures SiC crystal boules and our facilities in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, the Czech Republic and Bucheon, South Korea manufacture silicon and SiC wafers that are used by a number of our facilities.\nThe table below sets forth information with respect to the manufacturing facilities we operate either directly or pursuant to joint ventures, the reportable segments that use such facilities, and the approximate gross square footage of each site's building, which includes, among other things, manufacturing, laboratory, warehousing, office, utility, support and unused areas.\n\nLocation                                     Reportable Segment             Size (sq. ft.)\nFront-end Facilities:                                                                     \nEast Fishkill, New York                      AMG, ISG and PSG                    2,724,137\nGresham, Oregon                              AMG and PSG                           558,457\nRožnov pod Radhoštěm, Czech Republic         AMG and PSG                           450,755\nSeremban, Malaysia (Site 2) (3)              AMG, ISG and PSG                      133,061\nBucheon, South Korea                         AMG and PSG                         1,113,938\nMountaintop, Pennsylvania                    AMG and PSG                           437,000\nAizuwakamatsu, Japan                         AMG and PSG                           734,482\nNampa, Idaho (1) (2)                         ISG                                   166,268\nHudson, New Hampshire (1)                    PSG                                   272,036\nBack-end Facilities:                                                                      \nBurlington, Canada (1)                       AMG                                    95,440\nLeshan, China (3)                            AMG and PSG                           416,339\nSeremban, Malaysia (Site 1) (3)              AMG, ISG and PSG                      328,275\nCarmona, Philippines (3)                     AMG and PSG                           926,367\nTarlac City, Philippines (3)                 AMG and PSG                           381,764\nShenzhen, China (1)                          PSG                                   275,463\nBien Hoa, Vietnam (3)                        AMG and PSG                           294,418\nCebu, Philippines (3)                        AMG and PSG                           228,460\nSuzhou, China (3)                            AMG and PSG                           452,639\n(1)These facilities are leased.\n(2)This facility is used for both front-end and back-end operations.\n(3)These facilities are located on leased land.\nFor additional information regarding acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 5: ''Acquisitions and Divestitures'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. \nAll of our manufacturing facilities are fully owned and operated by us, except our assembly and test operations facility located in Leshan, China, which is owned by Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Limited, a joint venture company in which we own 80% of the outstanding equity interests (\"Leshan\"). The financial and operating results of Leshan have been consolidated in our financial statements. Our joint venture partner is Leshan Radio Company Ltd. (\"Leshan Radio\"), formerly a Chinese state-owned enterprise. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement between us and Leshan Radio, requests for production capacity are made to the board of directors of Leshan by each shareholder of the joint venture. Each request represents a purchase commitment, provided that any shareholder may elect to pay the cost associated with the unused capacity (which is generally equal to the fixed cost of the capacity) in lieu of satisfying the commitment. We purchased 80% of Leshan's production capacity in each of 2024, 2023 and 2022, and are currently committed to purchase approximately 80% of Leshan's expected production \n 11\n\n\ncapacity in 2025.\nWe use third-party contractors for some of our manufacturing activities, primarily for wafer fabrication and the assembly and testing of finished goods. Our agreements with these contract manufacturers typically require us to forecast product needs and commit to purchase services consistent with these forecasts. In some cases, longer-term commitments are required in the early stages of the relationship. These manufacturers collectively accounted for approximately 33% of our total manufacturing input costs in 2024, 36% in 2023 and 43% in 2022.\nFor information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations, see \"Risk Factors — Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nPatents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights\n\nWe market our products under worldwide trademarks, including the ON Semiconductor, ON, onsemi, and various product names and logos, and, in the United States and internationally, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, employee and non-disclosure agreements and licensing agreements to protect our IP. We acquired, licensed or sublicensed a significant amount of IP, including patents and patent applications, in connection with our acquisitions, and we have numerous United States and foreign patents issued, allowed and pending. We do not consider our business substantially dependent on any single onsemi patent. Our policy is to protect our products and processes by asserting our IP rights where appropriate and prudent and by obtaining patents, copyrights and other IP rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. We believe the duration of our IP rights is adequate to protect our products and processes.\nFor information regarding risks associated with intellectual property, see \"Risk Factors — Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Intellectual Property\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nSeasonality\nWe are currently experiencing fluctuations in our operating results due to general industry and macroeconomic conditions as well as within the semiconductor industry. However, we believe our business is driven more by content gains within applications and secular growth drivers and not solely by macroeconomic and industry cyclicality. For information regarding risks associated with the cyclicality and seasonality of our business, see \"Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to various United States and foreign environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include those relating to emissions and discharges into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the release of hazardous substances into the environment at or from our facilities and at other sites and the investigation and remediation of contamination. As with other companies engaged in like businesses, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of liabilities and claims, regardless of fault, with respect to such matters, including personal injury claims and civil and criminal fines.\nWe believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable environmental regulations for the year ended December 31, 2024 were not material, and we do not currently expect the cost of complying with existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, together with any liabilities for currently known environmental conditions, to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures or earnings or on our competitive position in any one year. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations, government policies, customer specification, personnel and physical property conditions, including currently undiscovered contamination, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects. See Note 13: ''Commitments and Contingencies'' in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for information on certain environmental matters.\nWe are also subject to numerous United States and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, tariffs, trade sanctions, trade barriers, trade embargoes, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act (\"ITAR\"), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Additionally, United States and foreign governmental authorities have taken, and may continue to take, administrative, legislative or regulatory action that \n 12\n\n\ncould impact our operations.\nWe believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable trade regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, ITAR, FCPA, the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act, and similar applicable laws and regulations. The costs we incurred in complying with applicable trade regulations for the year ended December 31, 2024 were not material, and we do not currently expect the cost of complying with existing trade laws and regulations to have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures or earnings or on our competitive position in any one year. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in laws and regulations or government policies, could lead to material costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future business or prospects. For information regarding risks associated with import-export control regulations and similar applicable laws and regulations, see \"Risk Factors—Trends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\" included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Initiatives\nonsemi strives to be a responsible corporate citizen. We uphold ethical standards in our business practices and policies, and we believe that sustainable corporate practices and consistent attention to environmental, social and governance priorities will help enhance long-term value for our stockholders. \nonsemi strives to protect and respect its environment and energy resources for future generations throughout its operations, including wafer fabrication, assembly, test, support operations, and through its value chain. We have a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, supported by our climate change policy, which highlights the focus areas for climate change-related actions. In 2024, our near-term greenhouse gas emissions targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. We have formulated a strategy and are taking initial steps towards the achievement of our targets.\nWe work together with our customers, peers, partners and suppliers to promote continual improvement in human rights, labor, environment, health and safety, anti-corruption, ethics and management system standards within our operations and our supply chain. We proactively comply with the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”) Code of Conduct, which is aimed at eliminating forced labor, slavery and human trafficking and conflict minerals, pursuant to our involvement with the Responsible Minerals Initiative. \nOur Board of Directors (the \"Board of Directors\" or the \"Board\") and management regularly evaluate our corporate responsibility policies, including our Code of Business Conduct and other corporate social responsibility policies and programs, to help ensure an effective outcome and adherence by our employees, suppliers, vendors and partners. \nHuman Capital Resources\nCore Principles\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate our employees involved in the design, development, manufacturing and support of new and existing products and services. We value the diversity of our workforce and work consciously to create growth and development opportunities for our employees, embracing different perspectives and fostering an inclusive work environment. As we are a member of the RBA, its principles are fundamental to our corporate culture and core values and are reflected in our commitments to our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders. These principles include providing a safe and positive work environment for our employees that emphasizes learning, professional development and respect for individuals and ethical conduct.\nHeadcount\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 26,400 regular full-time employees and approximately 90 part-time and temporary employees in facilities located in 33 countries. Approximately 15% of our regular full-time employees are located in the United States and Canada, 12% in Europe and Middle Eastern countries and 73% in Asia Pacific and Japan, with approximately 72% engaged in manufacturing, 2% in research and development, 4% in customer service or other aspects of sales and marketing, and 22% in other roles. Approximately 230 of our domestic employees (or approximately 1% of our United States-based employees) are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and all of these employees are located at our Mountain Top, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility. Certain of our foreign employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements (e.g., those in China, Vietnam, Japan, the Czech Republic and Belgium) or similar arrangements or are represented by workers councils. \n 13\n\n\nCompensation, Benefits, Health, Safety and Wellness\nOur compensation philosophy is focused on delivering competitive compensation with total rewards based on corporate affordability in a way that enables attraction, retention, and recognition of performance. We provide our employees and their families with access to flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that secure them during events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being. We use a combination of total rewards and other programs (which vary by region and salary grade) to attract and retain our employees, including: annual performance bonuses; stock awards, including an employee stock purchase plan; retirement support; healthcare and insurance benefits; business travel and disability insurance; health savings and flexible spending accounts; flexible work schedules, vacation and paid time off; parental leave; paid counseling assistance; education assistance; and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers.\nCareer Growth and Development\nWe invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving employee motivation, performance and retention. Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We have established a leadership pathway model as a tool for employees to practice and apply learning as part of their development.\nTurnover\nWe monitor employee turnover rates by region and globally. The average tenure of our employees is approximately 11 years and approximately 42% of our employees have been employed by us for more than ten years. We believe our compensation philosophy, along with the career growth and development opportunities we offer, promotes longer employee tenure and reduces voluntary turnover. \nInformation about Our Executive Officers \nCertain information concerning our executive officers as of February 10, 2025 is set forth below.\n\nName                                   Age   Position                                                             \nHassane El-Khoury                       45   President, Chief Executive Officer and Director                      \nThad Trent                              57   Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer      \nSimon Keeton                            51   Group President, PSG                                                 \nSudhir Gopalswamy                       55   Group President, ISG and AMG                                         \nAll of our executive officers are also officers of SCI LLC.

      "text": "Item 1A.    Risk Factors\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes \"forward-looking statements,\" as that term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated in this Form 10-K could be deemed forward-looking statements, particularly statements about our plans, strategies and prospects under the headings \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Business.\" Forward-looking statements are often characterized by words such as \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"projects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"should\" or similar expressions, or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. All forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are made based on our current expectations, forecasts, estimates and assumptions, and involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause results or events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements are described below. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update such information, which speaks only as of the date made, except as may be required by law.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty, and you should carefully consider the trends, risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with or furnished to the SEC before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. The risk factors described below are not all of the risks we may face. Other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may materially affect our business. If any of the following trends, risks or uncertainties actually occurs or continues, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Business\nThe manufacturing and other operations required to produce our products are highly dependent on the efficient operation of numerous processes, including processes contingent upon third-party component manufacturers and other service providers, and any disruption in these processes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing network includes multiple owned and third-party facilities, which may each produce one or more components necessary for the assembly of a single product. As a result of this interdependence, an operational disruption at a facility may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products. In the event of a disruption at any such facility, we may be unable to effectively source replacement components on acceptable terms from qualified third parties, in which case our ability to produce many of our products could be materially disrupted or delayed. Conversely, some of our facilities are single source facilities that only produce one of our end-products, and a disruption at any such facility would materially delay or cease production of the related product. In the event of any such operational disruption, we may experience difficulty in beginning production of replacement components or products at new facilities or transferring production to other existing facilities, any of which could result in a loss of future revenues and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, for certain manufacturing activities and for the supply of raw materials, we utilize third-party suppliers. Our agreements with these manufacturers typically require us to commit to purchase services based on forecasted product needs, which may be inaccurate, and, in some cases, require longer-term commitments. We are also dependent upon a limited number of highly specialized third-party suppliers for required components and materials for certain of our key technologies. Arranging for replacement manufacturers and suppliers can be time-consuming and costly, and the number of qualified alternative providers can be extremely limited. Our business operations, productivity and customer relations could be materially adversely affected if these contractual relationships were disrupted or terminated, the cost of such services increased significantly, the quality of the services provided deteriorated or our forecasted needs proved to be materially incorrect. Generally, our agreements with suppliers of raw materials impose no minimum or continuing supply obligations, and we obtain our raw materials and supplies from a large number of sources. Shortages could occur in various essential raw materials, and if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner, the costs of our raw materials increase significantly, their quality deteriorates or they give rise to compatibility or performance issues in our products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur manufacturing efficiency is contingent upon the operations of these interdependent processes and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency, increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors, or be successful in our manufacturing rationalization plans. For example, public health crises may cause disruption to our domestic and international operations. Any associated worker absenteeism, quarantines and restrictions on certain of our employees’ ability to perform their jobs, office \n 16\n\n\nand factory closures or restrictions, labor shortages, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures and/or other travel or health-related restrictions could, depending on the magnitude of such effects on our manufacturing activities (or activities of our suppliers, third-party distributors or sub-contractors), cause disruption and delay to our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments. Such disruption and delays could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing facilities, testing facilities and external manufacturers at expected or minimum purchase obligation levels, or if production capacity increases while revenue does not, the fixed costs and other operating expenses associated with these facilities and arrangements will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross profits, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, if we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this could strain our manufacturing and supply chain operations, and negatively impact our working capital. Moreover, if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products, we may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If we purchase or commit to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.\nWe may be unable to implement certain business strategies and restructuring initiatives and any issue with the pursuit of such strategies and initiatives could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nWe may from time to time determine to implement business strategies and restructuring initiatives in order to remain competitive. Because our strategies and restructuring activities may involve changes to many aspects of our business, including the location of our production facilities and personnel and the potential exit of certain product lines and businesses, our ability to successfully do so depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we are not able to effectively manage or efficiently implement these strategies and/or restructuring initiatives for reasons within or outside of our control, then our business operations could be materially adversely affected. \nIn addition, implementation of a business strategy may lead to the disruption of our existing business operations. For example, in light of our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, we may take actions to pursue our goal of generating net-zero emissions that may result in material expenditures that could impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or could disrupt our existing operations. Similarly, the contingent risks associated with transferring our existing operations to an acquirer, as is the case with several transition services being provided in connection with some of our prior divestitures, could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or could disrupt our existing operations, especially if the acquirer is unable to meet its commitments under any transition services agreements or if the acquirer encounters financial difficulty. Furthermore, our increased investment in manufacturing capacity (including increased investment in capacity for SiC-based products and technology), while concurrently divesting other non-strategic operations, may adversely impact our existing operations, require additional management time and effort to implement successfully, and lead to higher than anticipated capital expenditures.\nIn relation to production of SiC-based products and manufacturing at EFK and at our facilities in Hudson, New Hampshire, the Czech Republic and South Korea, we may face challenges or risks related to: increased capital spending and long-term capital expenditure commitments, installing and qualifying new manufacturing equipment, meeting planned process yields, maintaining suitable quality control and educating or providing employees with the requisite know-how to operate the processes at our expanded manufacturing facilities. There are inherent execution risks in expanding production capacity, whether at one of our own factories or at a third party that we utilize, all of which could increase our costs and negatively impact our operating results. \nIn addition, to streamline our operations and for efficiency purposes, we are pursuing a number of actions, including the outsourcing of certain internal business processes and the deployment of enhanced end-to-end digital processes (which, in some cases, include the use of AI) for certain business use cases. Such opportunities for improvement and enhanced productivity bring risks associated with managing change, transition costs, and the potential for reduced productivity or user error, in addition to those risks specific to each new process.\nThe failure to successfully and timely realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions or strategies could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, even if we fully execute and implement these activities, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business, including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position. To the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other anticipated benefits of strategy or restructuring initiatives, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to identify and make the substantial research and development investments or develop new products required to satisfy customer demands, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to \n 17\n\n\nmarket enhanced technologies and products. The development of new products is complex and time-consuming, often requiring significant capital investment and lead time for development and testing. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development required to remain competitive. In addition, the lengthy development cycle for certain of our products could limit our ability to adapt quickly to changes affecting the product markets and requirements of our customers and end-users, and we may be unable to develop innovative responses to our customers’ and end-users’ evolving needs on the timelines they require or at all. There can be no assurance that we will win competitive bid selection processes, known as \"design wins,\" for new products. In addition, design wins do not guarantee that we will make customer sales or generate sufficient revenue to recover design and development investments, realize a return on the capital expended or achieve expected gross margins, as expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. To the extent that we underinvest in our research and development efforts, fail to recognize the need for innovation with respect to our products, or our investments and capital expenditures in research and development do not lead to sales of new products, we may be unable to bring to market technologies and products attractive to customers, and so our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Further, products that are commercially viable may not have an immediate impact on our revenue or contribute to our operating results in a meaningful way until at least a few years after they are introduced into the market.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technologies, innovation, short product life cycles, evolving regulatory and industry standards and certifications, changing customer needs, wide fluctuations in supply and demand and frequent new product introductions. Products are often replaced by more technologically advanced substitutes and, as demand for older technology falls, the price at which such products can be sold drops. If we cannot advance our process technologies or improve our production efficiencies to a degree sufficient to maintain required margins, we will no longer be able to make a profit from the sale of older products. In certain limited cases, we may not be able to cease production of older products, either due to contractual obligations or for customer relationship reasons and, as a result, may be required to bear a loss on such products for a sustained period of time. If reductions in our production costs fail to keep pace with reductions in market prices for products we sell, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If our new product development efforts fail to align with the needs of our customers, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive, and has experienced significant consolidation, and if we are unable to compete effectively or identify attractive opportunities for consolidation, it could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nOur ability to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry depends on elements both within and outside of our control. We face significant competition within each of our product lines from major global semiconductor companies as well as smaller companies focused on specific market niches. In addition, companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future. \nIf we are unable to compete effectively, our competitive position could be weakened relative to our peers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our future success depends on many factors, including the development of new technologies and effective commercialization and customer acceptance of our products, and our ability to increase our position in current markets, expand into adjacent and new markets, and optimize operational performance. Products or technologies developed by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. We also may be unable to market and sell our products if they are not competitive on the basis of price, quality, technical performance, features, system compatibility, ease of use, customized design, innovation, availability, delivery timing and reliability. If we fail to compete effectively on developing strategic relationships with customers and customer sales and technical support, our sales and revenue may be materially adversely affected. Competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise prices, and any inability to maintain revenue or raise prices to offset increases in costs could have a significant adverse effect on our gross margin. Our gross margins vary due to a variety of factors. Reduced sales and lower gross margins would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. \nThe semiconductor industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant consolidation among companies and vertical integration among customers. Larger competitors resulting from consolidations may have certain advantages over us, and we may be at a competitive disadvantage if we fail to identify attractive opportunities to acquire companies to expand our business. Consolidation among competitors and integration among customers could erode our market share, impair our capacity to compete and require us to restructure operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, some of our competitors may receive governmental subsidies or other incentives that give them a competitive advantage over us. For example, the United States and the European Union have enacted legislation to provide funding and incentives for semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing in their respective regions. If we are unable to access such funding or incentives, or if our competitors receive more funding or incentives than we do, we may be at a disadvantage in developing and producing new or improved products or technologies, which could adversely affect our market share, revenue \n 18\n\n\nand profitability.\nBecause a significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in the automotive and industrial end-markets, including revenue pursuant to our long-term supply agreements, a downturn or lower sales to customers in either end-market could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our sales are to customers within the automotive industry and the industrial sector and the demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in these end-markets. Sales into the automotive and industrial end-markets represented approximately 55% and 25% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. The automotive industry is cyclical and the industrial sector tends to thrive during a time of economic expansion, and, as a result, our customers in each end-market are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, inflationary pressure, increases in interest rates, disruptive innovation and end-market preferences, which can adversely affect sales of our products and, correspondingly, our results of operations. Changes in demand in these end-markets or changes that have the potential to disrupt sales activities to customers in these end-markets, can significantly impact our operating results. Additionally, the quantity and price of our products sold to customers in each end-market could decline despite continued growth in such end-markets. Lower sales to customers in either end-market may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \nFurther, to the extent we have long-term supply agreements with our customers in multiple end-markets which includes fixed pricing, we could be subject to fluctuating manufacturing costs that could negatively impact our profitability. Additionally, under our long-term supply agreements, we could incur certain obligations if we are not able to fulfill our commitments. Furthermore, certain customers, from time to time, have sought and may seek to amend or cancel the delivery or other terms of their long-term supply agreements with us. When any such contractual amendments are made, the timing, pricing or amount of products delivered under such long-term supply agreements may be modified in circumstances where we believe it advances the long-term customer relationship. Such an event could have an impact on our results of operations.\nOur operating results depend, in part, on the performance of independent distributors.\nA portion of our sales occurs through global and regional distributors that are not under our control. We rely on distributors to grow and develop their customer base and anticipate customer needs, and any lack of such actions by our distributors may adversely affect our results of operations. These independent distributors also generally represent product lines offered by several companies and are not subject to any minimum sales requirements or obligation to market our products to their customers. In turn, distributors could reduce their sales efforts for our products or choose to terminate their representation of us. In addition, in the event a distributor were to face financial difficulty, experience significant operational disruptions or terminate its operations, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if a significant distributor terminates its operations or were to merge with another distributor, we may be more reliant and dependent on the distribution network of our remaining distributors. Additionally, we rely on our distributors to provide accurate and timely sales reports in order for us to be able to generate financial reports that accurately represent distributor sales of our products during any given period. Any inaccuracies or untimely reports could adversely affect our ability to produce accurate and timely financial reports and recognize revenue.\nChanges in, and the regulatory implementation of, tariffs or other government trade policies or political conditions could reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, which may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe imposition of or increase in tariffs, export controls and other trade restrictions as a result of international trade disputes or changes in trade policies or political conditions may adversely affect our sales and profitability. For example, a significant trade disruption, additional tariffs, trade protection measures, export or import regulations or other restrictions imposed related to our business and the related geopolitical uncertainty between the United States, China, Canada, Mexico and other countries or any retaliatory actions from such governments could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \nMore specifically, our assembly and test operations facility located in Leshan, China, which is owned by Leshan-Phoenix Semiconductor Company Limited, a joint venture company in which we own 80% of the outstanding equity interests, may be subjected to increased costs or additional trade restrictions stemming from the geopolitical tension between the United States and China. The U.S. Department of Commerce could in the future add additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list or unverified list or take other actions that could expand licensing requirements or otherwise impact the market for our products and our revenue. These rules may require us to apply for and obtain additional export licenses to supply certain of our products to customers in China, and there is no assurance that we will be issued licenses that we apply for on a timely basis or at all. Additional tariffs, export controls or other trade restrictions between the two countries could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, tariffs on components that we import from certain nations that have imposed, or may in the future impose, tariffs may adversely affect our profitability unless we are able to exclude such components from the tariffs or we raise prices for our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors. To the extent that our sales or profitability are negatively affected by any such tariffs or other trade actions, our business and results of \n 19\n\n\noperations may be materially adversely affected. \nOur international sales and purchases are subject to numerous additional United States and foreign laws and regulations related to import and export matters. For example, licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries under applicable export control regulations, including the provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. A determination by the United States government or any foreign government that we have failed to comply with trade or export regulations can result in penalties, including fines, administrative, civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities, seizure of products, or, in the extreme case, denial of export privileges or suspension or debarment from government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, business and results of operations.\nOur power technologies used for AI may not capture market share as expected, and issues related to the responsible use of AI may adversely affect our business.\nOur extensive range of power technologies are used to help power AI and related data centers and we expect this part of our business to grow. The emergence of big data and new tools such as machine learning and AI that capitalize on the availability of large data sets is leading semiconductor manufacturers to pursue new products and approaches, and there is an intense competition to capture market share in this emerging market. We may not be able to develop and offer the technology solutions that our AI-focused customers demand in a timely manner or effectively, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. Our failure to commercialize new technologies that can power AI and data centers in a timely manner or at all could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nAs with many new emerging technologies, AI presents risks and challenges and increasing legal, social and ethical concerns relating to its responsible use that could affect the adoption of AI. Third-party misuse of AI applications, models, or solutions, or ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by our customers could cause harm to individuals or society and impair the public’s acceptance of AI, which would in turn adversely affect our business. \nWe may be unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. \nOur success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel, both in the United States and internationally. In the semiconductor industry, the competition for qualified personnel, particularly experienced design engineers and other technical employees, is intense. Furthermore, we have operations in many parts of the world that are currently experiencing a tight labor market for skilled employees. Additionally, we have entered into employment agreements with certain senior executives, but we do not have employment agreements with most of our employees. Many of these employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice and would be free to work for a competitor. Specific elements of our compensation programs may not be competitive with those of our competitors, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel or recruit the key personnel we require. If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all and other senior management may be required to divert attention from other aspects of our business. Loss of the services of, or failure to effectively recruit, qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position and on our business.\nWarranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls, and the failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our contracts, could harm our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \nManufacturing semiconductors is a highly complex and precise process, requiring production in a tightly controlled, clean environment. Minute impurities in our manufacturing materials, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, manufacturing equipment failures, and other defects can cause our products to be non-compliant with customer requirements or otherwise nonfunctional. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury or property damage (or both). In addition, if any of our designed products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in their recall. As suppliers become more integrally involved in electrical design, OEMs are increasingly expecting them to warrant their products and are looking to them for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls. A successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage, if any, and established reserves, or a requirement that we participate in a product recall, could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, in the event that our products fail to perform as expected or such failure of our products results in a recall, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Even if our products meet standard specifications, our customers may attempt to use our products in applications for which our products were not designed or in customer products that were not designed or manufactured properly, resulting in product failures and creating customer satisfaction issues, which may harm our reputation.\n 20\n\n\nSince a defect or failure in our products could give rise to failures in the goods that incorporate them (and claims for consequential damages against our customers from their customers), we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenue and profits we receive from the products involved. In certain instances, we attempt to limit our liability through our standard terms and conditions or other contractual provisions, but there is no assurance that such limitations will be effective. To the extent we are liable for damages in excess of the revenue and profits received from the products involved, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nCurrency fluctuations, changes in foreign exchange regulations and repatriation delays and costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have sizeable sales and operations in the Asia/Pacific region and Europe, and a significant amount of this business is transacted in currency other than U.S. dollars. In addition, while a significant percentage of our cash is generated outside the United States, many of our liabilities, including our outstanding indebtedness, and certain other cash payments, such as share repurchases, are payable in the United States in U.S. dollars. As a result, currency fluctuations and changes in foreign exchange regulations can have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, repatriation of funds held outside the United States could have adverse tax consequences and could be subject to delay due to required local country approvals or local obligations. Foreign exchange regulations may also limit our ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency. As a result of having a lower amount of cash and cash equivalents in the United States, our financial flexibility may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make interest and principal payments due under our various debt obligations. Restrictions on repatriation or the inability to use cash held abroad to fund our operations in the United States may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Intellectual Property\nIf our technologies are subject to claims of infringement on the IP rights of others, efforts to address such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may from time to time be subject to claims that we may be infringing the IP rights of others. If necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses under such IP rights. However, we cannot assure you that we will obtain such licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for IP we use could cause us to incur substantial liabilities or to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring such technologies. Further, we may be subject to IP litigation, which could cause us to incur significant expense, materially adversely affect sales of the challenged product or technologies and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. In the event of an adverse outcome or pursuant to the terms of a settlement of any such litigation, we may be required to: pay substantial damages or settlement costs; indemnify customers or distributors; cease the manufacture, use, sale or importation of infringing products; expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing technologies; discontinue the use of certain processes; or obtain licenses, which may not be available on reasonable terms, to continue the use, development and/or sale of the allegedly infringing technologies. \nThe outcome of IP litigation is inherently uncertain and, if not resolved in our favor, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the IP we have developed or licensed, our competitive position, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe enforceability of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, software licenses and other IP is uncertain in certain circumstances. Effective IP protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in the United States and internationally. The various laws and regulations governing our registered and unregistered IP assets, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, mask works and copyrights to protect our products and technologies are subject to legislative and regulatory change and interpretation by courts. With respect to our IP generally, we cannot assure you that:\n•any of the substantial number of United States or foreign patents and pending patent applications that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others; \n•any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought; \n•any of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how or mask works that we employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, abandoned or licensed to others; \n•any of our pending or future trademark, copyright, or mask work applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought; or\n•that we will be able to successfully enforce our IP rights in the United States or foreign countries. \nInfringement or misappropriation of our IP could result in lost market and revenue opportunities, and if we are unable to enforce and protect our IP it could have an adverse impact on our competitive position and business. Further, our assertion of IP rights often results in the other party seeking to assert alleged IP rights of its own against us, which may materially and \n 21\n\n\nadversely impact our business. An unfavorable ruling in these sorts of matters could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products, which could in turn negatively affect our business, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patents or pending patent applications. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies, including technologies that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors’ rights agreements with our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that persons or institutions will not assert rights to IP arising out of our research. Should we be unable to protect our IP, competitors may develop products or technologies that duplicate our products or technologies, benefit financially from innovations for which we bore the costs of development and undercut the sales and marketing of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Technology and Data Privacy\nDisruptions or breaches of our information technology systems could irreparably damage our reputation and our business, expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe routinely collect and store sensitive data, including confidential and other proprietary information about our business and our employees, customers, suppliers and business partners. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations and business strategy. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions, failures or breaches of our information technology environment, such as those caused by computer viruses, illegal hacking, criminal fraud or impersonation, acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error. Our cybersecurity measures and/or those of our third-party service providers and/or customers may not detect or prevent such security breaches. Although we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business as of the year ended December 31, 2024, we continue to devote resources to reduce the risk of or alleviate cybersecurity breaches and vulnerabilities and those costs could be significant. Although we maintain a cybersecurity program to manage cybersecurity risks, our efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions and delays that may materially impede our sales, manufacturing operations, distribution or other critical functions. Any compromise of our information security could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or that of other parties with which we do business, an interruption in our operations, the unauthorized transfer of cash or other of our assets, the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws. In addition, computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, and any such attack, if successful, could expose us to liability to customer claims. Further, AI capabilities may be used to identify vulnerabilities and craft increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks. Any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We maintain cyber risk insurance, although an insufficiency of insurance coverage could adversely affect our cash flows and overall profitability. Furthermore, our efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations related to cybersecurity may be costly and any failure to comply could result in investigations, proceedings, investor lawsuits and reputational damage.\nWe are subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. \nThe legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect Personally Identifiable Information (\"PII\") and other data as part of our business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions that are currently more restrictive than those in the United States. Additionally, within the United States, different states have enacted various regulations governing the treatment of PII. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, could result in additional cost and liability to Company officials or us, including substantial monetary fines, and could damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business.\nOur extensive reliance on, and investments in, information technology systems, including reliance on third-party service providers, could have a materially adverse impact on our business. \nWe rely extensively on information technology systems and related personnel to collect, use, retain, manage, transmit, and protect transactions and data. For these information technology systems, applications, and processes to operate effectively, we or our service providers must maintain and update them. Delays in the maintenance, updates, upgrading, or patching of these systems, applications or processes, as well as the actions taken to maintain, update, upgrade and patch, could impair their effectiveness or expose us to security risks.\nSome of these systems are managed or provided by third-party service providers, including certain cloud platform providers. Failure by these third-party service providers to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to \n 22\n\n\nadequately monitor their performance, could result in our inability to achieve expected efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved and despite the availability of contractual remedies against these providers, such errors can also lead to business disruption, systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can materially adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems, infrastructure and personnel, in certain cases with the assistance of strategic partners and other third-party service providers. These investments involve replacing existing systems, some of which are older, legacy systems that are less flexible and efficient, with successor systems; outsourcing certain technology and business processes to third-party service providers; making changes to existing systems; maintaining or enhancing legacy systems that are not currently being replaced; designing or cost effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality; or testing the use and incorporation of AI, including generative AI. These efforts could result in significant potential risks, including failure of the systems to operate as designed, unexpected impacts on related systems or processes, potential loss or corruption of data, failures in security processes and internal controls, cost overruns, implementation delays or errors, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. Any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges, security failures, reputational harm, and increased costs that could adversely affect our business operations, our relationships with our customers, and results of operations.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Regulation\nEnvironmental and health and safety liabilities and expenditures could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \nThe semiconductor industry continues to be subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. In addition, our operations and those of our suppliers are further governed by regulations focused on conflict minerals and restrictions on other materials, as well as laws or regulations governing the operation of our facilities, sale and distribution of our products, and real property.\nWe also have operations subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other requirements, regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances. We have indemnities from third parties for certain environmental and health and safety liabilities for periods prior to our operations at some of our current and past sites, and we have also purchased environmental insurance to cover certain claims related to historical contamination and future releases of hazardous substances. However, we cannot assure you that such indemnification arrangements and insurance will cover any or all of our material environmental costs. In addition, the nature of our operations exposes us to the continuing risk of environmental and health and safety liabilities including: \n•changes in United States and international environmental or health and safety laws, regulations or policies, including, but not limited to, future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns and conflict minerals; \n•the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced, administered or interpreted; \n•our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities; \n•the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims, including the cost of clean-up of currently unknown environmental conditions; or \n•the cost of fines, penalties or other legal liability, should we fail to comply with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations.\nWe incur costs associated with complying with evolving environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and related disclosure obligations such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could subject us to significant costs and liabilities. To the extent that we face unforeseen environmental or health and safety compliance costs or remediation expenses or liabilities that are not covered by indemnities or insurance, we may bear the full effect of such costs, expenses and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could result in penalties that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and/or other benefits, along with various other anti-corruption laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. If \n 23\n\n\nwe are not in compliance with the FCPA and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws by the United States or foreign authorities could harm our reputation and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \nWe conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries and are, therefore, subject to complex income tax and transfer pricing regulations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Changes to, or interpretations of, tax legislation or regulations could significantly increase our effective tax rate or affect our tax obligations and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities. In addition, other factors or events, such as changes to our operating structure, strategy and investment decisions, could also increase our future effective tax rate or affect our tax obligations and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities.\nChanges in tax laws from international and domestic initiatives, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's base erosion and profit shifting project and potential U.S. tax reforms, could adversely affect our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”). Beginning in 2026, the effective rate for FDII increases from 13% to 16%. Additionally, if U.S. rates increase and/or the FDII deduction is eliminated or reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely (potentially materially) affected. Furthermore, if our customers move manufacturing operations to the United States, our FDII deduction may be reduced.\nThese types of initiatives and changes, if adopted or enacted, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the impact of any new tax legislation may differ from our estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made and future regulatory guidance.\nSocial and environmental responsibility regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer and investor demands, may make our supply chain more complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers and investors.\nWith the increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry, a number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions or requirements that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions or requirements in their procurement terms and conditions. In addition, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to source products that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armed conflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products. As a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers’ demands, which may harm our sales and operating results.\nMany investors also expect companies to disclose corporate social and environmental policies, practices and metrics under voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks. We periodically communicate our strategies, goals and targets related to our corporate social and environmental policies and programs. These strategies, goals and targets, and their underlying assumptions and projections, reflect our current plans and aspirations, but we may be unable to achieve them. It is also possible that our investors might not be satisfied with our policies, programs, goals, performance and related disclosures, or the speed of their adoption, implementation and measurable success, or that we have adopted such policies, programs and commitments at all.\nIn addition, unfavorable ratings or assessment of our corporate social and environmental policies and programs, including our compliance with certain voluntary disclosure standards and frameworks, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and cost of capital.\nFurthermore, in light of our goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, future customer or investor expectations and regulatory requirements, we may take actions to pursue our goal of generating net-zero emissions or to alter our processes that may result in material expenditures that could impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or disrupt our existing operations.\n 24\n\n\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur debt could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $3,379.9 million of outstanding principal relating to our indebtedness. We may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future to repay or refinance other outstanding debt, to make acquisitions or for other purposes, and if we incur additional debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $1.1 billion available for future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to our potential and current investors, including impacting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate purposes.\nTo the extent that we continue to maintain or expand our significant indebtedness, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe inability to meet our obligations under our Credit Agreement could materially and adversely affect us by, among other things, limiting our ability to conduct our operations and reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nThe obligations under the Credit Agreement are collateralized by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the guarantors under the Credit Agreement, including a pledge of the equity interests in certain of our domestic and first-tier foreign subsidiaries. As a result, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations under the Credit Agreement, the lenders could take possession of and foreclose on the pledged collateral securing the indebtedness, in which case we would be at risk of losing the related collateral, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayment if the outstanding amounts drawn thereunder exceed the total commitments, which may result in prepaying outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility rather than using funds for other business purposes. Our financing structure, and any inability to meet our obligations thereunder, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including, among other things, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes and could reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. \nThe agreements relating to our indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement and the 3.875% Notes, may restrict our ability to operate our business, and as a result may materially adversely affect our results of operations. \nOur debt agreements, including the Credit Agreement and the 3.875% Notes, contain, and any future debt agreements may include, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictive covenants may significantly limit our ability to: incur additional debt; incur liens; make certain investments or acquisitions; redeem, or otherwise perform our obligations under the terms of, our 3.875% Notes; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; engage in mergers or consolidations or certain other \"change of control\" transactions; make distributions to our stockholders; engage in restructuring activities; engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions; and issue or repurchase stock or other securities.\nSuch agreements may also require us to satisfy other requirements, including maintaining certain financial ratios and condition tests. Our ability to meet these requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet them. To the extent we fail to meet any such requirements and are in default under our debt obligations, our financial condition may be materially adversely affected. \nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations, and any inability to repay our debt when required would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to make required payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive, and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash to satisfy our debt obligations as they come due, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling additional assets, reducing or delaying capital investments, or seeking to raise additional capital. We cannot assure you that any refinancing would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or would be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. \nFurthermore, we cannot assure you that, if we were required to repurchase any of our debt securities upon a change of control or other specified event, our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt securities. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our collateralized debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness, which could materially negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. A default under our committed credit facilities, including our Credit Agreement, could also limit our ability to make further \n 25\n\n\nborrowings under those facilities, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, to the extent we are not able to borrow or refinance debt obligations, we may have to issue additional shares of our common stock, which would have a dilutive effect to the stockholders immediately prior to such issuance.\nAn event of default under any agreement relating to our outstanding indebtedness could cross default other indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf there were an event of default under certain of our agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately, which default or acceleration of debt could cross default other indebtedness. Any such cross default would put immediate pressure on our liquidity and financial condition and would amplify the risks described above with regards to being unable to repay our indebtedness when due and payable. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default and, as described above, any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our operating subsidiaries, which may have no independent obligation to repay our debt, are not able to make cash available to us for such repayment, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal, contractual, governmental, or regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions or payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and, as described above, any inability to repay our debt when due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf interest rates increase, our debt service obligations under our variable rate indebtedness could increase significantly, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBorrowings under certain of our facilities from time to time, including under our Credit Agreement, are at variable rates of interest and as a result expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates increased throughout 2022 and 2023. While interest rates have stabilized during 2024, if interest rates increase or remain at elevated levels, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. We may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. To the extent the risk materializes and is not fully mitigated, the resulting increase in interest expense could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, significant changes in our credit rating, disruptions in the global financial markets, including bank failures, or incurrence of new or refinancing of existing indebtedness at higher interest rates could have a material and adverse effect on our access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition.\nThe timing of the cash payments to service the 0% Notes, the 0.50% Notes and the 3.875% Notes is not entirely in our control and may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy these obligations in a timely manner.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had outstanding approximately $804.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 0% Notes, $1,500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% Notes and $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.875% Notes (collectively, the \"Outstanding Notes\"). Holders of the Outstanding Notes have certain rights that would require us to make repurchases prior to the stated maturity for all or a portion of the amounts due in certain circumstances. For example, holders of the 3.875% Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all of their 3.875% Notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events accompanied by certain ratings events (as described in the indenture governing the 3.875% Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, accrued prior to, but not including, the repurchase date.\nServicing the Outstanding Notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under such notes. Our ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the 0% Notes or the 0.50% Notes, repurchase any of the Outstanding Notes in the case of an applicable repurchase-triggering event under the respective indentures or repay such notes at maturity will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. \nIn certain circumstances, a takeover of our Company and similar triggering events could also trigger an option of the holders of \n 26\n\n\nthe 0% Notes, the 0.50% Notes and the 3.875% Notes to require us to repurchase such notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our Company that would otherwise be beneficial to the holders of the 0% Notes, the 0.50% Notes, the 3.875% Notes and our common stock, which could materially decrease the value of such notes and of our common stock.\nThe terms of the Credit Agreement and the terms of the 3.875% Notes limit the amount of future indebtedness secured by liens that we may incur. If we incur significantly more debt, this could intensify the risks described above. Our decision to use our cash for other purposes, such as to make acquisitions or to repurchase our common stock, could also intensify these risks.\nNote hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may materially adversely affect the value of our common stock. \nConcurrently with the issuances of the 0% Notes and the 0.50% Notes, respectively, we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions, which we refer to as the option counterparties. The convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the respective series of notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes of such series, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties with respect to the 0% Notes and the 0.50% Notes. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds $74.34, with respect to the 0% Notes and $156.78 with respect to the 0.50% Notes. \nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions for the 0% Notes and the 0.50% Notes, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of such notes. The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time. Any of these activities could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nCounterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions, if realized, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. \nTo the extent the option counterparties do not honor their contractual commitments with us pursuant to the note hedge transactions, we could face a material increase in our exposure to potential dilution upon any conversion of the 0% Notes and/or the 0.50% Notes and/or cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 0% Notes and/or the 0.50% Notes, as the case may be. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the option counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences with respect to our common stock. Any such adverse tax consequences or increased cash payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nTrends, Risks and Uncertainties Related to Our Common Stock\nProvisions in our charter documents may delay or prevent the acquisition of us, which could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock. \nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions: \n•establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting; \n•authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, which is preferred stock that our Board of Directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval and that could be issued with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt; and \n•require the approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding common stock to amend certain of these provisions in our certificate of incorporation or by-laws. \n 27\n\n\nAlthough we believe these provisions make a higher third-party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, these provisions apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. Any delay or prevention of an acquisition of us that would have been beneficial to our stockholders could materially decrease the value of our common stock.\nThe amount and frequency of our share repurchases are affected by a number of factors and may fluctuate.\nAlthough we have adopted a share repurchase program, we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares under our share repurchase program or at all. The amount, timing, and purchases under our share repurchase program, if any, are influenced by many factors and may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash and because of changes in tax laws, and the market price of our common stock. In addition, we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may be unable to successfully make or integrate strategic acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nWe have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions, investments and other alliances including the formation of joint ventures that involve significant risks and uncertainties. Successful acquisitions and alliances in our industry require, among other things, efficient integration and aligning of product offerings and manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts, often in markets or regions in which we have less experience. Risks related to successful integration of an acquisition include, but are not limited to: (1) the ability to integrate information technology and other systems; (2) issues not discovered in our due diligence; (3) customers responding by changing their existing business relationships with us or the acquired company; (4) diversion of management’s attention from our day to day operations; and (5) loss of key employees post-integration. In addition, we may incur unexpected costs or taxes resulting from the acquisition or integration of the newly acquired business. Missteps or delays in integrating our acquisitions, which could be caused by factors outside of our control, or our failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions on the timeline we anticipate, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDepending on the level of our ownership interest in and the extent to which we can exercise control over the acquired business, we may be required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and SEC rules and regulations to consolidate newly acquired businesses into our consolidated financial statements. The acquired businesses may not have independent audited financial statements or statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, or the acquired businesses may have financial controls and systems that are not compatible with our financial controls and systems, any of which could materially impair our ability to properly integrate such businesses into our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis. Any revisions to, inaccuracies in or restatements of our consolidated financial statements due to accounting for our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our financial position and results of operations.\nDownturns or volatility in general economic conditions, as well as general macroeconomic trends and impacts, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nHistorically, worldwide semiconductor industry sales have tracked the impacts of adverse economic conditions, specifically financial crises, subsequent recoveries and persistent economic uncertainty. Recent global economic slowdowns could continue and potentially result in certain economies dipping into economic recessions, including in the United States. \nWe have in the past and could in the future experience period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to general industry or economic conditions; the onset of an economic recession and volatile or uncertain economic conditions can adversely impact our sales and profitability and make it difficult for us and our competitors to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Furthermore, inflationary pressure and increases in interest rates have and may continue to increase our costs, which \n 28\n\n\ncould negatively impact revenue, earnings and demand for our products.\nIn addition to general economic conditions, impacts of other macroeconomic events, such as public health crises, geopolitical tensions or conflicts and risks, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, climate change and other severe weather and natural disasters, banking failures and uncertainties in global financial markets, could materially adversely impact our operations by causing disruptions in the geographies in which we and our suppliers, third party distributors and sub-contractors operate. If any of these events impact our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments could be delayed, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, disruption of transportation and distribution systems could result in reduced operational efficiency and customer service interruption. Such events can negatively impact revenue and earnings and can significantly impact cash flow.\nWe have been and may be subject to or involved in litigation or threatened litigation, the outcome of which may be difficult to predict, and which may be costly to defend, divert management attention, require us to pay damages, or restrict the operation of our business.\nFrom time to time, we have been and may be subject to disputes and litigation, with and without merit, that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Moreover, complaints filed against us may not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek, and we therefore may be unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us. Even if we are able to estimate losses related to these actions, the ultimate amount of loss may be materially higher than our estimates. Any resolution of litigation, or threatened litigation, could involve the payment of damages or expenses by us, which may be significant or involve an agreement with terms that restrict the operation of our business. Even if any future lawsuits are not resolved against us, the costs of defending such lawsuits may be significant. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities. Allegations made in the course of legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims. We can provide no assurance that additional litigation will not be filed against us in the future. See Note 13: “Commitments and Contingencies – Legal Matters” in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information on our legal proceedings.\nRegulatory and legislative developments related to climate change may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nVarious jurisdictions have developed or are developing climate change-based laws or regulations that could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as heightened investor expectations, on corporate environmental and social responsibility practices and disclosure are subject to change, can be unpredictable and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourced manufacturing. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply, with such policies or provisions or meet the requirements of our customers and investors, a customer may stop purchasing products from us or an investor may sell their shares, or parties may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations. Any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Furthermore, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or others in our industry could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.",
