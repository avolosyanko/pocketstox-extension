BUSINESS\nBusiness Overview\n We are a people-first global biopharmaceutical company striving to deliver first- and best-in-class therapies to transform the lives of patients facing serious diseases. Our first commercial product, ARIKAYCE, is approved in the US as ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion and in Japan as ARIKAYCE inhalation 590mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). ARIKAYCE received accelerated approval in the US in September 2018 for the treatment of MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options in a refractory setting. In October 2020, the European Commission (EC) approved ARIKAYCE for the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung infections caused by MAC in adults with limited treatment options who do not have cystic fibrosis (CF). In March 2021, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved ARIKAYCE for the treatment of patients with NTM lung disease caused by MAC who did not sufficiently respond to prior treatment with a multidrug regimen. NTM lung disease caused by MAC (which we refer to as MAC lung disease) is a rare and often chronic infection that can cause irreversible lung damage and can be fatal.\nOur pipeline includes clinical-stage programs, brensocatib, TPIP, and INS1201 as well as pre-clinical research programs. Brensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1), which we are developing for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis and other neutrophil-mediated diseases, including chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). TPIP is an inhaled formulation of the treprostinil prodrug treprostinil palmitil which may offer a differentiated product profile for pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). INS1201 is an intrathecally delivered gene therapy for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Our pre-clinical research programs encompass a wide range of technologies and modalities, including gene therapy, artificial intelligence-driven protein engineering, protein manufacturing, RNA end-joining, and synthetic rescue. A summary of our commercial and pipeline products is shown below:\nThe information below summarizes our updates and anticipated near-term milestones for ARIKAYCE and our product candidates.\nARIKAYCE\n•Following the announcement of positive topline results from the ARISE trial, in June 2024, we met and aligned with the FDA on the primary endpoint for the ENCORE trial. If the data are positive, ENCORE may support a label expansion to include all MAC lung patients as well as support full approval for the current refractory indication.\n•We completed enrollment in the ENCORE trial with 425 patients in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n•We anticipate reporting topline data from the ENCORE trial in the first quarter of 2026, with the submission of a US supplementary new drug application for ARIKAYCE in all patients with MAC lung disease projected for late 2026.\nBrensocatib\n•We announced positive topline results from the ASPEN trial in May 2024. The study met its primary endpoint, with both dosage strengths of brensocatib demonstrating statistically significant reductions in the annualized rate of adjudicated pulmonary exacerbations (PEs) versus placebo.\n•Our new drug application (NDA) for brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis was accepted and granted priority review by the FDA in February 2025. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA set a target action date of August 12, 2025. We are advancing commercial readiness activities in preparation for a launch of brensocatib for patients with bronchiectasis and, if approved, we anticipate a US launch in the third quarter of 2025. Launches in Europe and Japan are expected in 2026, pending approvals.\n•We initiated a Phase 2b study of brensocatib in patients with CRSsNP, which we refer to as the BiRCh trial, in the fourth quarter of 2023. We anticipate reporting topline data from the BiRCh trial before the end of 2025.\n•We initiated a Phase 2b study of brensocatib in patients with HS, which we refer to as the CEDAR trial, in December 2024.\nTPIP\n•In May 2024, we reported topline safety data and certain exploratory efficacy endpoints from the Phase 2a study of TPIP in patients with PH-ILD. We anticipate initiating a Phase 3 study of TPIP in patients with PH-ILD in the second half of 2025.\n•Enrollment of the Phase 2b study of TPIP in patients with PAH was completed in the fourth quarter of 2024, with 102 patients enrolled in the study. We anticipate topline results for this study in mid-2025.\nGene Therapy\n•In the fourth quarter of 2024, we received clearance from the FDA for our investigational new drug (IND) application for INS1201, an intrathecally delivered gene therapy for patients with DMD. We anticipate initiating a clinical trial in patients with DMD in the first half of 2025.\nPre-Clinical Programs\n•We continue to progress our pre-clinical research programs across a wide range of technologies and modalities, including gene therapy, artificial intelligence-driven protein engineering, protein manufacturing, RNA end-joining, and synthetic rescue.\nTo complement our internal research and development, we also actively evaluate in-licensing and acquisition opportunities for products, product candidates and technologies, including those that address serious diseases with significant unmet need.\nOur Strategy\nWe strive to develop and commercialize first- and best-in-class therapies that serve patient communities where the need is greatest. Our first product, ARIKAYCE, is approved in the US as ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion and in Japan as ARIKAYCE inhalation 590mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). We are not aware of any other approved inhaled therapies specifically indicated to treat MAC lung disease in North America, Europe or Japan. We believe that ARIKAYCE has the potential to prove beneficial in other patients with refractory MAC. Our product candidates are brensocatib, our Phase 3 product candidate that we are developing for patients with bronchiectasis and other neutrophil-mediated diseases, TPIP, our Phase 2 product candidate that may offer a differentiated product profile for patients with PH-ILD and PAH, and INS1201, our intrathecally delivered gene therapy product candidate for patients with DMD. We announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 ASPEN trial of brensocatib in May 2024 and the acceptance by the FDA of our NDA, with priority review granted, for brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis in February 2025, which we anticipate will be followed by filings with the European and Japanese regulatory authorities. We are also advancing our pre-clinical research programs encompassing a wide range of technologies and modalities, including gene therapy, AI-driven protein engineering, protein manufacturing, RNA end-joining, and synthetic rescue.\nOur key priorities are as follows:\n•Continue to provide ARIKAYCE to appropriate patients and expand our reliable revenue stream;\n•Advance commercial readiness activities to serve significantly more patients facing serious diseases;\n•Produce topline clinical data readouts in the near and long term; and\n•Control spending, prudently deploying capital to support the best return-generating opportunities.\nARIKAYCE for Patients with MAC Lung Disease\n     ARIKAYCE is our first approved product. ARIKAYCE received accelerated approval in the US in September 2018 for the treatment of refractory MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options. In October 2020, ARIKAYCE received approval in Europe for the treatment of NTM lung infections caused by MAC in adults with limited treatment options who do not have CF. In March 2021, ARIKAYCE received approval in Japan for the treatment of patients with NTM lung disease caused by MAC who did not sufficiently respond to prior treatment with a multidrug regimen. MAC lung disease is a rare and often chronic infection that can cause irreversible lung damage and can be fatal. Amikacin solution for parenteral administration is an established drug that has activity against a variety of NTM; however, its use is limited by the need to administer it intravenously and by toxicity to hearing, balance, and kidney function. Unlike amikacin solution for intravenous administration, our proprietary Pulmovance™ technology uses charge-neutral liposomes to deliver amikacin directly to the lungs where liposomal amikacin is taken up by the lung macrophages where the MAC infection resides. This technology also prolongs the release of amikacin in the lungs, while minimizing systemic exposure, thereby offering the potential for decreased systemic toxicities. ARIKAYCE's ability to deliver high levels of amikacin directly to the lung and sites of MAC infection via the use of our Pulmovance technology distinguishes it from intravenous amikacin. ARIKAYCE is administered once-daily using Lamira, an inhalation device developed and manufactured by PARI. Lamira is a portable nebulizer that enables aerosolization of liquid medications via a vibrating, perforated membrane, and was designed specifically for ARIKAYCE delivery.\nThe FDA has designated ARIKAYCE as an orphan drug and a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for the treatment of NTM lung disease. Orphan designated drugs are eligible for seven years of exclusivity for the orphan indication. QIDP designation provides an additional five years of exclusivity for the designated indication. The FDA granted a total of 12 years of exclusivity in the indication for which ARIKAYCE was approved.\nARIKAYCE also has been included in the international treatment guidelines for NTM lung disease treatment. The evidence-based guidelines, issued by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), European Respiratory Society (ERS), European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), strongly recommend the use of ARIKAYCE for MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options who have failed to convert to a negative sputum culture after at least six months of treatment.\nIn October 2020, the FDA approved a supplemental new drug application for ARIKAYCE, adding important efficacy data regarding the durability and sustainability of culture conversion to the ARIKAYCE label. The data, which are from the Phase 3 CONVERT study of ARIKAYCE, demonstrate that the addition of ARIKAYCE to guideline-based therapy (GBT) was associated with sustained culture conversion through the end of treatment as well as durable culture conversion three months post-treatment compared with GBT alone.\nAccelerated Approval\nIn March 2018, we submitted an NDA for ARIKAYCE to the FDA to request accelerated approval. Accelerated approval allows drugs that (i) are being developed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and (ii) provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments to be approved substantially based on an intermediate endpoint or a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, rather than a clinical endpoint such as survival or irreversible morbidity. In September 2018, the FDA granted accelerated approval for ARIKAYCE under the Limited Population Pathway for Antibacterial and Antifungal Drugs (LPAD) for the treatment of refractory MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options. LPAD, which was enacted as part of the 21st Century Cures Act, serves to advance the development of new antibacterial drugs to treat serious or life-threatening infections in limited populations of patients with unmet needs. As required for drugs approved under the LPAD pathway, labeling for ARIKAYCE includes certain statements to convey that the drug has been shown to be safe and effective only for use in a limited population.\nAs a condition of accelerated approval, we must conduct a post-marketing confirmatory clinical trial. In December 2020, we commenced the post-marketing confirmatory clinical trial program for ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease consisting of the ARISE trial, an interventional study designed to validate cross-sectional and longitudinal characteristics of a PRO tool in MAC lung disease, and the ENCORE trial, designed to establish the clinical benefits and evaluate the safety of ARIKAYCE in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent MAC lung infection who have not started antibiotics using the PRO tool validated in the ARISE trial. In September 2023, we announced positive topline results from the ARISE trial. The study met its primary objective of demonstrating that the QOL-B respiratory domain works effectively as a PRO tool in patients with MAC lung disease. In June 2024, we met and aligned with the FDA on the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study. If the data are positive, ENCORE may support a label expansion to include all MAC lung patients as well as support full approval for the current refractory indication. Based on feedback and in alignment with the FDA, we have determined that the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study will include eight questions from the QOL-B respiratory domain PRO. We completed enrollment of the ENCORE study in the fourth quarter of 2024, with 425 patients enrolled. We anticipate reporting topline data in the first quarter of 2026.\nReimbursement Outside of the US\nIn October 2020, the EC granted marketing authorization for ARIKAYCE for the treatment of NTM lung infections caused by MAC in adults with limited treatment options who do not have CF. ARIKAYCE can now be prescribed for appropriate patients across the European Union (EU) countries as well as in the United Kingdom (UK). ARIKAYCE is reimbursed nationally in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland. We have worked with the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds towards an agreement on the reimbursement price of ARIKAYCE that would allow us to better serve the needs of patients in Germany; however, since we have been unable to reach an agreement, patient supply of ARIKAYCE in Germany was enabled by import from other EU countries in September 2022. To date, we have been unable to reach an acceptable agreement of a nationally reimbursed price with the Italian Medicines Agency; however, ARIKAYCE remains commercially available for physicians to prescribe in Italy under Class C, where we set the price and funding is agreed locally.\nIn March 2021, Japan's MHLW approved ARIKAYCE for the treatment of patients with NTM lung disease caused by MAC who did not sufficiently respond to prior treatment with a multidrug regimen. In July 2021, we launched ARIKAYCE in Japan.\nThe CONVERT Study and 312 Study\nAccelerated approval of ARIKAYCE was supported by preliminary data from the CONVERT study, a global Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of ARIKAYCE in adult patients with refractory MAC lung disease, using achievement of sputum culture conversion (defined as three consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures) by Month 6 as the primary endpoint. Patients who achieved sputum culture conversion by Month 6 continued in the CONVERT study for an additional 12 months of treatment following the first monthly negative sputum culture in order to assess the durability of culture conversion, as defined by patients that have completed treatment and continued in the CONVERT study off all therapy for three months. In May 2019, we presented at the American Thoracic Society meeting that 41/65 (63.1%) of patients on ARIKAYCE plus GBT who had achieved culture conversion by Month 6 had maintained durable culture conversion for three months off all therapy compared to 0/10 (0%) on GBT only (p<0.0002). Safety data for these patients were consistent with safety data previously reported for patients by Month 6 of the CONVERT study.\nPatients who did not culture convert by Month 6 may have been eligible to enroll in the 312 study, an open-label extension study for these non-converting patients who completed six months of treatment in the CONVERT study. The primary objective of the 312 study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of ARIKAYCE in combination with a standard multi-drug regimen. The secondary objectives of the 312 study included evaluating the proportion of subjects achieving culture conversion (defined in the same way as the CONVERT study) by Month 6 and the proportion of subjects achieving culture \nconversion by Month 12, which was the end of treatment. We previously reported interim data as of December 2017 for patients in the 312 study, with 28.4% of patients who received GBT only in the CONVERT study (19/67) and 12.3% of patients who had received ARIKAYCE plus GBT in the CONVERT study (7/57) achieving culture conversion by Month 6 of receiving ARIKAYCE plus GBT as part of the 312 study. The 312 study has concluded and final efficacy data regarding culture conversion were consistent with these interim data. We have analyzed the safety and efficacy data from the 312 study, and we did not observe any new safety signals.\nThe ARISE Study\nThe ARISE trial was a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3b study in adult patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent MAC infections that aimed to generate evidence demonstrating the domain specification, reliability, validity, and responsiveness of PRO-based scores, including a respiratory symptom score. The ARISE study met its primary objective of demonstrating that the QOL-B respiratory domain works effectively as a PRO tool in patients with MAC lung disease. Based on feedback and in alignment with the FDA, we have determined that the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study will include eight questions from the QOL-B respiratory domain PRO.\nPatients in ARISE (N=99) were randomized 1:1 to treatment with ARIKAYCE plus macrolide-based background regimen (ARIKAYCE arm) or placebo plus macrolide-based background regimen (comparator arm) once daily for six months, followed by one month off treatment. ARIKAYCE-treated patients performed better than those in the comparator arm as measured by the QOL-B instrument, with 43.8% of patients achieving an improvement in QOL-B respiratory score above the estimated meaningful within-subject score difference of 14.8, compared with 33.3% of patients in the comparator arm. While the study was not powered to show a statistically significant difference between treatment arms, a strong trend toward significance was observed for improvement from baseline at Month 7 (12.24 vs. 7.76, p=0.1073). Patients in the ARIKAYCE arm also achieved nominally statistically significantly higher culture conversion rates at Month 7 versus patients in the comparator arm (78.8% vs. 47.1%, p=0.0010), and culture conversion was faster and more likely to persist through Month 7 for the ARIKAYCE arm.\nConsistent with our expectations, the FDA and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan confirmed that they would not consider a label expansion for ARIKAYCE based on data from the ARISE study alone.\nARISE Culture Conversion\nConsistent with prior clinical studies, a higher proportion of patients in the ARIKAYCE arm achieved culture conversion by Month 6 (defined as negative cultures at Months 5 and 6) compared to patients in the comparator arm (80.6% vs. 63.9%, p=0.0712). Among patients who achieved culture conversion by Month 6, more patients in the ARIKAYCE arm achieved the first of their two required monthly negative cultures for clinical conversion at Month 1 versus the comparator arm (74.3% vs. 46.7%). As reported above, at Month 7 (one month following the cessation of treatment), 78.8% of patients in the ARIKAYCE arm vs. 47.1% of patients in the comparator arm were culture-converted, suggesting that ARIKAYCE-treated patients are more likely to remain negative.\nCorrelation Between ARISE Culture Conversion and QOL-B Performance\nPatients in the ARIKAYCE arm who achieved culture conversion at both Month 6 and Month 7 had nominally statistically significantly greater improvements in QOL-B respiratory domain scores at Month 7 compared to patients in the ARIKAYCE arm who did not achieve culture conversion (15.74 vs. 3.53, p=0.0167 at Month 6 and 14.89 vs. 4.50, p=0.0416 at Month 7).\nARISE Safety and Tolerability\nThe discontinuation rate of ARIKAYCE or the placebo used in the comparator arm was 22.9% in the ARIKAYCE arm and 7.8% in the comparator arm. Study completion rates were 91.7% in the ARIKAYCE arm and 94.1% in the comparator arm. No new safety events were observed in the ARIKAYCE arm, and the safety profile in general was as expected in both treatment arms. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 91.7% of patients in the ARIKAYCE arm and 80.4% of patients in the comparator arm. The most common TEAEs were dysphonia (41.7% for the ARIKAYCE arm vs. 3.9% for the comparator arm), cough (27.1% vs. 7.8%), diarrhea (27.1% vs. 25.5%), and COVID-19 (12.5% vs. 9.8%). Of the treatment-emergent serious adverse events observed in the trial, none were determined to be related to ARIKAYCE by investigators.\nFurther Research and Lifecycle Management\nWe are currently exploring and supporting research and lifecycle management programs for ARIKAYCE beyond treatment of refractory MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial regimen for adult patients who have limited or no treatment options. As noted above, we will continue to advance the post-marketing confirmatory MAC lung disease clinical trial program for ARIKAYCE, through the completed ARISE and ongoing ENCORE trials, which are intended to fulfill the FDA's post-marketing requirement to allow for the full approval of ARIKAYCE in the US, as well as to support the use of ARIKAYCE as a treatment for patients with MAC lung disease.\nThe ENCORE trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3b study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an ARIKAYCE-based regimen in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent MAC infection who have not started antibiotics. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive ARIKAYCE plus background regimen or placebo plus background regimen once daily for 12 months. Patients will then discontinue all study treatments and remain in the trial for three months for the assessment of durability of culture conversion. The primary endpoint is change from baseline to Month 13 in respiratory symptom score. The key secondary endpoint is the proportion of subjects achieving durable culture conversion at Month 15. In June 2024, we met and aligned with the FDA on the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study. If the data are positive, ENCORE may support a label expansion to include all MAC lung patients as well as support full approval for the current refractory indication. Based on feedback and in alignment with the FDA, we have determined that the primary endpoint for the ENCORE study will include eight questions from the QOL-B respiratory domain PRO. We completed enrollment of the ENCORE study in the fourth quarter of 2024, with 425 patients enrolled. We anticipate reporting topline data in the first quarter of 2026.\nSubsequent lifecycle management studies could also potentially enable us to reach more patients. These initiatives may include new clinical studies sponsored by us and may also include investigator-initiated studies, which are independent clinical studies initiated and sponsored by physicians or research institutions, with funding from us.\nMarket Opportunity for ARIKAYCE in MAC Lung Disease\nNTM lung disease is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality, and MAC is the predominant pathogenic species in NTM lung disease in the US, Europe and Japan. The prevalence of NTM lung disease has increased over the past two decades, and we believe it is an emerging public health concern worldwide. Based on an analysis using information from external sources, including market research funded by us and third parties, and internal analyses and calculations, we estimate the potential patient populations in the US, the European 5 (comprised of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) and Japan are as follows:\n\nPotential Market              Estimated Number of Patients with Diagnosed MAC Lung Disease        Estimated Number of Patients with Refractory MAC Lung Disease\nUnited States                                                               95,000-115,000                                                        12,000-17,000\nEuropean 5                                                                          14,000                                                                1,400\nJapan                                                                      125,000-145,000                                                        15,000-18,000\nWe are not aware of any other approved inhaled therapies specifically indicated for NTM lung disease in North America, Europe or Japan. Based on a burden of illness study that we conducted in the US with a major medical benefits provider, we previously concluded that patients with NTM lung disease are costly to healthcare plans, while a claims-based study in the US has shown that patients with NTM lung disease have higher resource utilization and costs than their age and gender-matched controls. Accordingly, we believe that a significant market opportunity for ARIKAYCE in NTM lung disease exists in the US and internationally.\nProduct Pipeline\nBrensocatib\nBrensocatib is a small molecule, oral, reversible inhibitor of DPP1, which we licensed from AstraZeneca in October 2016. DPP1 is an enzyme responsible for activating neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) in neutrophils when they are formed in the bone marrow. Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell and play an essential role in pathogen destruction and inflammatory mediation. Neutrophils contain the NSPs (including neutrophil elastase, proteinase 3, and cathepsin G) that have been implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases. In chronic inflammatory lung diseases, neutrophils accumulate in the airways and result in excessive active NSPs that cause lung destruction and inflammation. Brensocatib may decrease the damaging effects of inflammatory diseases such as bronchiectasis by inhibiting DPP1 and its activation of NSPs.\nIn June 2020, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for brensocatib for the treatment of adult patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) for reducing exacerbations. The FDA's breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of therapies that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include more frequent communication and meetings with the FDA, eligibility for rolling and priority review, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, and organizational commitment from the FDA involving senior managers. In November 2020, brensocatib was granted access to the PRIME scheme from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for patients with NCFBE.\nIn October 2021, the EMA’s Paediatric Committee approved the brensocatib Pediatric Investigational Plan for the treatment of patients with NCFBE. Subsequently, the ASPEN trial included 41 adolescent patients between ages 12 to 17, \nwhich will fulfill the pediatric study requirements to support marketing applications in this patient population in the US, Europe and Japan.\nThe WILLOW Study\nThe WILLOW study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center, multi-national, Phase 2b study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of brensocatib administered once daily for 24 weeks in patients with NCFBE. The WILLOW study was conducted at 116 sites and enrolled 256 adult patients diagnosed with NCFBE who had at least two documented pulmonary exacerbations in the 12 months prior to screening. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 10 mg or 25 mg of brensocatib or matching placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to first pulmonary exacerbation over the 24-week treatment period in the brensocatib arms compared to the placebo arm.\nWILLOW Efficacy Data\nWe announced topline data for the WILLOW study in February 2020 and full data for the WILLOW study in June 2020. In September 2020, final results from the WILLOW study were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. The data demonstrate that the WILLOW study met its primary endpoint of time to first pulmonary exacerbation over the 24-week treatment period for both the 10 mg and 25 mg dosage groups of brensocatib compared to placebo (p=0.027, p=0.044, respectively). The risk of exacerbation at any time during the trial was reduced by 42% for the 10 mg group versus placebo (HR 0.58, p=0.029) and by 38% for the 25 mg group versus placebo (HR 0.62, p=0.046). In addition, treatment with brensocatib 10 mg resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of pulmonary exacerbations, a key secondary endpoint, versus placebo. Specifically, patients treated with brensocatib experienced a 36% reduction in the 10 mg arm (p=0.041) and a 25% reduction in the 25 mg arm (p=0.167) versus placebo. Change in concentration of active neutrophil elastase in sputum versus placebo from baseline to the end of the treatment period was also statistically significant (p=0.034 for 10 mg, p=0.021 for 25 mg).\nWILLOW Safety and Tolerability Data\nBrensocatib was generally well-tolerated in the study. Rates of AEs leading to discontinuation in patients treated with placebo, brensocatib 10 mg, and brensocatib 25 mg were 10.6%, 7.4%, and 6.7%, respectively. The most common AEs in patients treated with brensocatib were cough, headache, sputum increase, dyspnea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection. Rates of adverse events of special interest (AESIs) in patients treated with placebo, brensocatib 10 mg, and brensocatib 25 mg, respectively, were as follows: rates of skin events (including hyperkeratosis) were 11.8%, 14.8%, and 23.6%; rates of dental events were 3.5%, 16.0%, and 10.1%; and rates of infections that were considered AESIs were 17.6%, 13.6%, and 16.9%.\nThe ASPEN Study\nBased on the positive results of the WILLOW study, in December 2020 we commenced the ASPEN study, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brensocatib in adult patients with bronchiectasis. Patients with bronchiectasis due to CF were not enrolled in the study. The primary endpoint was the rate of adjudicated PEs over the 52-week treatment period. Secondary endpoints included the time to first adjudicated PE, the proportion of subjects free of adjudicated PE by 52 weeks, the absolute change from baseline in post-bronchodilator FEV1, the reduction in annualized rate of severe adjudicated PE, and the change from baseline in the Bronchiectasis QOL-B Respiratory Symptoms Domain Score.\nThe total number of active sites in ASPEN was 391 sites in 35 countries. Adult patients (ages 18 to 85 years) were randomized 1:1:1 and adolescent patients (ages 12 to <18 years) were randomized 2:2:1 for treatment with brensocatib 10 mg, brensocatib 25 mg, or placebo once daily for 52 weeks, followed by 4 weeks off treatment.\nASPEN Safety and Efficacy Data\nWe announced positive topline results from the ASPEN trial in May 2024. The primary efficacy analysis included data from 1,680 adult patients and 41 adolescent patients. Brensocatib was well-tolerated in the study. In addition, the study met its primary endpoint, with both dosage strengths of brensocatib demonstrating statistically significant reductions in the annualized rate of adjudicated PEs versus placebo. The study also met several of its prespecified secondary endpoints with statistical significance. In February 2025, the FDA accepted our NDA, with priority review granted, for brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis.\nTopline efficacy results from the ASPEN study were as follows:\n\n                                                                                                                       Brensocatib 10 mg compared to placebo                               Brensocatib 25 mg\n                                                                                                                                                                                         compared to placebo\nPrimary Endpoint                                                                                                                                                                                            \nReduction in annualized rate of PEs                                                                                         21.1%                  p=0.0019*                         19.4%         p=0.0046*\nSecondary Endpoints                                                                                                                                                                                         \nProlongation of time to first PE                                                                                            18.7%                  p=0.0100*                         17.5%         p=0.0182*\nIncrease in odds of remaining exacerbation free over 52 weeks                                                               41.2%                  p=0.0059*                         40.0%         p=0.0074*\nChange from baseline in post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at week 52                          11 mL                   p=0.3841                         38 mL         p=0.0054*\nReduction in annualized rate of severe PEs                                                                                  25.8%                   p=0.1277                         26.0%          p=0.1025\nChange from baseline in the Quality of Life – Bronchiectasis (QOL-B) Respiratory Score at week 52                      2.0 points                   p=0.0594                    3.8 points         p=0.0004^\n* - Statistically significant                                                                                                                                                                               \n^ - Nominally significant p-value                                                                                                                                                                           \nFurther Research and Development\nIn August 2019, we received notice from the FDA that we were awarded a development grant of $1.8 million for specific work to be performed on a PRO tool. The grant funding was for the development of a novel PRO tool for use in clinical trials to measure symptoms in patients with NCFBE with and without NTM lung infection. The grant has come to the end of the funding period and met the objectives with grant deliverables submitted to the FDA’s Drug Development Tool Qualification Program for evaluation by the FDA.\nIn January 2023, we reported topline data from the Phase 2a, multiple-dose, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of brensocatib in patients with CF. This Phase 2a study included both patients who were on background CFTR modulator drugs and patients who were not on CFTR modulator drugs. The study duration was approximately one month and dosed CF patients to placebo, 10 mg, 25 mg, and 40 mg of brensocatib. A clear dose-dependent and exposure-dependent inhibition of blood NSPs was observed in patients treated with brensocatib across all doses in this study, consistent with the mechanism of action of brensocatib. Safety and tolerability were consistent with what was observed during the Phase 2b WILLOW study, with no significant drug-related findings. We concluded that an additional cohort evaluating a 65 mg dose of brensocatib is not needed in this patient population.\nWe are conducting further studies to explore the potential of brensocatib in additional neutrophil-mediated diseases, including CRSsNP and HS. CRSsNP currently has one approved pharmacological therapy (corticosteriod nasal spray); however, many patients do not respond to corticosteroids or endoscopic sinus surgery. The Phase 2b BiRCh trial of brensocatib in patients with CRSsNP is underway. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we initiated a Phase 2b study of brensocatib in patients with HS.\nMarket Opportunity for Brensocatib in Bronchiectasis\nBronchiectasis is a severe, chronic pulmonary disorder in which the bronchi become permanently dilated due to a cycle of infection, inflammation, and lung tissue damage. The condition is marked by frequent pulmonary exacerbations requiring antibiotic therapy and/or hospitalizations. Symptoms include chronic cough, excessive sputum production, shortness of breath, and repeated respiratory infections, which can worsen the underlying condition. Based on information from external sources, including market research funded by us and third parties, and internal analyses and calculations, we estimate the potential addressable market in bronchiectasis at launch in the US, the European 5 and Japan will be as follows (approximately):\n\nPotential Market             Estimated Number of Patients Diagnosed with Bronchiectasis\nUnited States                                                                   500,000\nEuropean 5                                                                      600,000\nJapan                                                                           150,000\nToday, there are no approved therapies in the US, Europe, or Japan for the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis.\nTreprostinil Palmitil Inhalation Powder\nTPIP is an investigational inhaled formulation of a treprostinil prodrug that has the potential to address certain of the current limitations of existing prostanoid therapies. We believe that TPIP prolongs duration of effect and may provide patients \nwith greater consistency in pulmonary arterial pressure reduction over time. Current inhaled prostanoid therapies must be dosed four to nine times per day. Reducing dose frequency has the potential to ease treatment burden for patients and improve compliance. Additionally, we believe that TPIP may be associated with fewer side effects, including severity and/or frequency of cough, headache, throat irritation, nausea, flushing and dizziness that are associated with high initial drug levels and local upper airway exposure when using current inhaled prostanoid therapies. We believe TPIP may offer a differentiated product profile for PH-ILD and PAH.\nIn February 2021, we announced topline results from the Phase 1 study of TPIP in healthy volunteers. The objective of this first-in-human single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and tolerability profile of TPIP. Data from the study demonstrated that TPIP was generally well tolerated, with a pharmacokinetic profile that supports continued development with once-daily dosing. The most common AEs across all cohorts in the study were cough, dizziness, headache, and nausea. Most AEs were mild in severity and consistent in nature with those typically seen with other inhaled prostanoid therapies. There were few moderate AEs and no severe or serious AEs. Subjects in the multiple dose panel that incorporated an up-titration approach beginning at 112.5 µg once-daily and progressing to 225 µg once-daily reported fewer AEs compared to the panel dosed with 225 µg once-daily from the first dose.\nOverall pharmacokinetic results demonstrated that treprostinil exposure (AUC and Cmax) was dose-proportional, with low to moderate inter-subject variability. Treprostinil was detected in the plasma at 24 hours at all doses and throughout the 48-hour sampling period for the two highest doses. Compared with currently available inhaled treprostinil therapy, TPIP showed substantially lower Cmax and longer half-life. Data from this study were presented in an oral session at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in August 2021.\nIn May 2024, we reported topline safety data and certain exploratory efficacy endpoints from the Phase 2a study of TPIP in patients with PH-ILD. We anticipate initiating a Phase 3 registration program in PH-ILD in the second half of 2025. We also have an ongoing Phase 2b study designed to investigate the effect of TPIP in patients with PAH. Enrollment in the Phase 2b study of TPIP in PAH completed in the fourth quarter of 2024 and we anticipate topline results in mid-2025.\nMarket Opportunity for TPIP in PH-ILD and PAH\nWe believe TPIP may be a highly effective therapy that has the potential to ease the treatment burden for patients with PH-ILD and PAH, improve compliance and be associated with fewer side effects compared to current therapies. Based on our assessment of information from external sources, including market research conducted by third parties, we estimate the potential addressable market for TPIP at launch in the US, the European 5 and Japan will be as follows (approximately):\n\nPotential Market            Estimated Number of Patients Diagnosed with PH-ILD       Estimated Number of Patients Diagnosed with PAH\nUnited States                                                           50,000                                                35,000\nEuropean 5                                                              65,000                                                40,000\nJapan                                                                   20,000                                                15,000\nGene Therapy\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we received clearance from the FDA for our IND application for INS1201, a microdystrophin adeno-associated virus gene replacement therapy for patients with DMD. Administered intrathecally, this approach has the potential to target both skeletal and cardiac muscles at lower doses. We anticipate initiating a clinical trial in patients with DMD in the first half of 2025.\nPre-Clinical Development\nOur early-stage research efforts are comprised of our preclinical programs, advanced through internal research and development and augmented through business development activities. In March 2021, we acquired a proprietary protein deimmunization platform, called Deimmunized by Design, focused on the reengineering of therapeutic proteins to evade immune recognition and reaction. In August 2021, we acquired Motus Biosciences, Inc. (Motus) and AlgaeneX, Inc. (AlgaeneX), preclinical stage companies engaged in the research, development and manufacturing of gene therapies for rare genetic disorders. In January 2023, we acquired Vertuis Bio, Inc. (Vertuis), a privately held, preclinical stage company engaged in the research and development of gene therapies for rare genetic disorders. In June 2023, we acquired Adrestia Therapeutics Ltd. (Adrestia), a privately held, preclinical stage company using precision genetic models to search for therapeutic targets, precision diagnostics, novel drug compounds and new applications for existing drugs.\nWe continue to progress our pre-clinical research programs across a wide range of technologies and modalities, including gene therapy, AI-driven protein engineering, protein manufacturing, RNA end-joining, and synthetic rescue.\nCorporate Development\nWe plan to continue to develop, acquire, in-license or co-promote other products, product candidates and technologies, including those that address serious diseases that currently have significant unmet needs. We are focused broadly on serious disease therapeutics and prioritizing those areas that best align with our core competencies.\nManufacturing\nWe do not have any in-house manufacturing capability other than for small-scale preclinical development programs and we depend completely on a small number of third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the manufacture of our product candidates for use in clinical trials. We plan to rely primarily on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the commercial manufacture and supply of most product candidates that we commercialize. ARIKAYCE is manufactured currently by Resilience Biotechnologies Inc. (Resilience) (formerly Therapure Biopharma Inc.) in Canada at a 200 kilogram (kg) scale. For additional information about our agreement with Resilience, see License and Other Agreements—ARIKAYCE-related Agreements.\nIn October 2017, we entered into certain agreements with Patheon UK Limited (Patheon), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Thermo Fisher), related to increasing our long-term production capacity for ARIKAYCE commercial inventory. The agreements provide for Patheon to manufacture and supply ARIKAYCE for our anticipated long-term commercial needs. Under these agreements, we are required to deliver to Patheon the required raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, and certain fixed assets needed to manufacture ARIKAYCE. The aggregate investment to increase the long-term production capacity, including under these agreements, and related agreements or purchase orders with third parties for raw materials and fixed assets, is estimated to be approximately $116.0 million. In addition, we have a commercialization agreement with PARI, the manufacturer of our drug delivery nebulizer for ARIKAYCE, to address our commercial supply needs (the Commercialization Agreement).\nIn January 2024, we entered into certain agreements with Patheon Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher, related to the manufacture and supply of brensocatib by Patheon Inc. for our anticipated long-term commercial needs. In addition, in September 2024, we entered into a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Esteve Química, S.A. (Esteve) for the manufacture and supply of brensocatib's active pharmaceutical ingredient. We are required to deliver to Patheon Inc. the active pharmaceutical ingredient needed to manufacture brensocatib. \nWe expect to utilize contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to fulfill our future manufacturing requirements for TPIP. Certain product candidates will be manufactured using future in-house manufacturing capabilities.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own or license rights to more than 850 issued patents and pending patent applications in the US and in foreign countries, including more than 300 issued patents and pending patent applications related to ARIKAYCE. Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain proprietary protection surrounding our product candidates, technology and know-how; to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We actively seek patent protection by filing patent applications, including on inventions that are important to the development of our business in the US, Europe, Japan, Canada, and selected other foreign markets that we consider key for our product candidates. These international markets generally include Australia, China, India, Israel and Mexico.\nOur patent strategy includes obtaining patent protection, where possible, on compositions of matter, methods of manufacture, methods of use, dosing and administration regimens and formulations. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, in-licensing and partnership opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.\nWe monitor for activities that may infringe our proprietary rights, as well as the progression of third-party patent applications that may have the potential to create blocks to our products or otherwise interfere with the development of our business. We are aware, for example, of US patents, and corresponding international counterparts, owned by third parties that contain claims related to treating lung infections using inhaled antibiotics. If any of these patents were to be asserted against us, we do not believe that our marketed product or development candidates would be found to infringe any valid claim of these patents.\nReflecting our commitment to safeguarding proprietary information, we require our employees, consultants, advisors, collaborators and other third-party partners to sign confidentiality agreements to protect the exchange of proprietary materials and information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.\nARIKAYCE Patents\nOf the patents and applications related to ARIKAYCE, there are 13 in force issued US patents that cover the ARIKAYCE composition and its use in treating NTM that are listed in the FDA Orange Book.

One or more of the patent applications, if issued as patents in their current form, may be eligible for listing in the FDA Orange Book for ARIKAYCE. We also own a pending US application that covers methods for making ARIKAYCE. We anticipate that in the US, we will have patent coverage for ARIKAYCE and its use in treating NTM lung disease, including NTM lung disease caused by MAC, through at least May 15, 2035.\nTen patents have been granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) (European Patent Nos. 1909759, 1962805, 2823820, 2852391, 3067046, 3142643, 3466432, 3766501, 4005576 and 4122470) that relate to ARIKAYCE and its use in treating NTM lung disease, including those caused by MAC infections. In addition, we have additional patent applications pending before the EPO that relate to ARIKAYCE and its use in treating NTM lung disease. European Patent No. 1909759 (the ’759 patent), owned by us, was previously opposed by Generics (UK) Ltd. A hearing was held on October 19, 2015, during which we submitted amended claims. The European Patent Office Opposition Division (EPOOD) maintained the patent as amended and Generics (UK) Ltd appealed the decision. The EPO Technical Board of Appeals heard arguments related to the appeal on January 8, 2019 and the product claims of the patent were held invalid. The method of manufacture claims was remitted to the EPOOD for further consideration, and the EPO has since maintained the validity of these claims. European Patent Nos. 1962805 and 3067046, both of which expire approximately five months after the ‘759 patent (December 5, 2026 vs. July 19, 2026), also include claims related to ARIKAYCE and its use in treating NTM lung disease.

At present, we have received two registrations for the INSMED mark and one registration for the ARIKAYCE mark from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We have also received notices of allowance or registrations in a number of countries abroad for the INSMED and ARIKAYCE marks, among others. The EMA has authorized the use of the name ARIKAYCE liposomal, and the FDA has approved our use of the name ARIKAYCE, as the trade name for amikacin liposome inhalation suspension. Our ability to obtain and maintain trademark registrations will in certain geographical locations depend on making use of the mark in commerce on or in connection with our products and approval of the trademarks for our products by regulatory authorities in each country.\nLicense and Other Agreements\nMulti-program Agreements\nPPD Development, L.P. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher)\nIn April 2020, we entered into a master services agreement with PPD Development, L.P. (PPD) pursuant to which we retained PPD to perform clinical development services in connection with certain of our clinical research programs. The master services agreement has an initial term of five years. Either party may terminate (i) any project addendum under the master services agreement for any reason and without cause upon 30 days’ written notice, (ii) any project addendum in the event of the other party’s breach of the master services agreement or such project addendum upon 30 days’ written notice, provided that such breach is not cured within such 30-day period, (iii) the master services agreement or any project addendum immediately upon the occurrence of an insolvency event with respect to the other party or (iv) any project addendum upon 30 days’ written notice if (a) the continuation of the services under such project addendum would post material ethical or safety risks to study participants, (b) any approval from a regulatory authority necessary to perform the applicable study is revoked, suspended or expires without renewal or (c) in the reasonable opinion of such party, continuation of the services provided under such project addendum would be in violation of applicable law. We have entered into project addenda with PPD to perform clinical development services over several years for, but not limited to, our ARISE, ENCORE and ASPEN studies and other trials involving brensocatib and TPIP. The total cost of these project addenda is $498.9 million.\nARIKAYCE-related Agreements\nWe currently rely, and will continue to rely, on agreements with a number of third parties in connection with the development and manufacture of ARIKAYCE.\nPARI\nWe have a licensing agreement with PARI for use of the optimized Lamira Nebulizer System for delivery of ARIKAYCE in treating patients with NTM lung infections, CF and bronchiectasis. Under the licensing agreement, we have rights under several US and foreign issued patents and patent applications involving improvements to the optimized Lamira Nebulizer System, to exploit the system with ARIKAYCE for the treatment of such indications, but we cannot manufacture the nebulizers except as permitted under our Commercialization Agreement with PARI, which is described in further detail below. Lamira has been approved for use in the US (in combination with ARIKAYCE) and EU and is authorized for use in Japan. We also currently have rights to use the nebulizers in expanded access programs and clinical trials. Lamira must receive regulatory approval before we can market ARIKAYCE outside the US, EU and Japan, and it is labeled as investigational for use in our clinical trials outside of these regions.\nWe have certain obligations under this licensing agreement in relation to specified licensed indications. With respect to NTM, we met all obligations to achieve certain commercial, developmental and regulatory milestones by the required deadlines. With respect to bronchiectasis, we have satisfied our obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to initiate a Phase 3 trial for bronchiectasis. With respect to CF, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory and reimbursement approval, market and sell ARIKAYCE in two or more major European countries, as well as to achieve certain milestones specified in the licensing agreement. Termination of the licensing agreement or loss of exclusive rights may occur if we fail to meet our obligations, including payment of royalties to PARI.\nUnder the licensing agreement, we paid PARI an upfront license fee and milestone payments. Upon FDA acceptance of our NDA and the subsequent FDA and EMA approvals of ARIKAYCE, we made additional milestone payments of €1.0 million, €1.5 million and €0.5 million, respectively, to PARI. In October 2017, we exercised an option to buy-down the royalties payable to PARI. PARI is entitled to receive royalty payments in the mid-single digits on annual global net sales of ARIKAYCE pursuant to the licensing agreement, subject to certain specified annual minimum royalties.\nThis licensing agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until the final royalty payments have been made with respect to the last country in which ARIKAYCE is sold, or until the agreement is otherwise terminated by either party. We have the right to terminate this licensing agreement upon written notice for PARI's uncured material breach, if PARI is the subject of specified bankruptcy or liquidation events, or if PARI fails to reach certain specified obligations. PARI has the right to terminate this licensing agreement upon written notice for our uncured material breach, if we are the subject of specified bankruptcy or liquidation events, if we assign or otherwise transfer the agreement to a third-party that does not agree to assume all of our rights and obligations set forth in the agreement, or if we fail to reach certain specified milestones.\nIn July 2014, we entered into a Commercialization Agreement with PARI for the manufacture and supply of the Lamira® Nebulizer Systems and related accessories (the Device), which is an e-Flow® nebulizer modified and optimized for use with ARIKAYCE. Under the Commercialization Agreement, PARI manufactures the Device except in the case of certain defined supply failures, when we will have the right to make the Device and have it made by third parties (but not certain third parties deemed under the Commercialization Agreement to compete with PARI). The Commercialization Agreement has an initial term of 15 years that began to run in October 2018 (the Initial Term). The term of the Commercialization Agreement may be extended by us for an additional five years by providing written notice to PARI at least one year prior to the expiration of the Initial Term.\nResilience\nIn February 2014, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with Therapure Biopharma Inc., which has been assumed by Resilience, for the manufacture of ARIKAYCE, on a non-exclusive basis, at a 200 kg scale. Pursuant to the agreement, we collaborated with Resilience to construct a production area for the manufacture of ARIKAYCE in Resilience's existing manufacturing facility in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The agreement had an initial term of five years, which began in October 2018, and renews automatically for successive periods of two years each, unless terminated by either party by providing the required two years' prior written notice to the other party. Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay a minimum of $6.0 million, subject to inflation, for commercial ARIKAYCE batches produced and certain manufacturing activities each calendar year. The agreement allows for termination by either party upon the occurrence of certain events, including (i) the material breach by the other party of any provision of the agreement or the quality agreement expected to be entered into between the parties, and (ii) the default or bankruptcy of the other party. In addition, we may terminate the agreement for any reason upon no fewer than 180 days' advance notice.\nPatheon (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher) and related agreements\nIn October 2017, we entered into certain agreements with Patheon related to the increase of our long-term production capacity for ARIKAYCE. The agreements provide for Patheon to manufacture and supply ARIKAYCE for our anticipated commercial needs. Under these agreements, we are required to deliver to Patheon the required raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, and certain fixed assets needed to manufacture ARIKAYCE. Patheon's supply obligations will \ncommence once certain technology transfer and construction services are completed. Our manufacturing and supply agreement with Patheon will remain in effect for a fixed initial term, after which it will continue for successive renewal terms unless either we or Patheon have given written notice of termination. The technology transfer agreement will expire when the parties agree that the technology transfer services have been completed. The agreements may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach of the other party or the other party’s insolvency. These early termination clauses may reduce the amounts due to the relevant parties. The aggregate investment to increase our long-term production capacity, including under the Patheon agreements and related agreements or purchase orders with third parties for raw materials and fixed assets, is estimated to be approximately $116.0 million.\nCystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc.\nIn 2004 and 2009, we entered into research funding agreements with Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. (CFFT) whereby we received $1.7 million and $2.2 million in research funding for the development of ARIKAYCE. As a result of the US approval of ARIKAYCE and in accordance with the CFFT agreements, as amended, we owe milestone payments to CFFT of $13.4 million in the aggregate payable through 2025, of which $10.4 million has been paid as of December 31, 2024. Furthermore, if certain global sales milestones were met within five years of the commercialization of ARIKAYCE, we would have owed up to an additional $3.9 million. We met and paid $1.7 million of these additional global sales milestone payments.\nBrensocatib-related Agreements\nAstraZeneca\nIn October 2016, we entered into a license agreement with AstraZeneca (the AZ License Agreement), pursuant to which AstraZeneca granted us exclusive global rights for the purpose of developing and commercializing AZD7986 (renamed brensocatib). In consideration of the licenses and other rights granted by AstraZeneca, we made an upfront payment of $30.0 million in late October 2016. In December 2020, we incurred a $12.5 million milestone payment obligation upon the first dosing in a Phase 3 clinical trial of brensocatib. In May 2024, upon our release of an official public statement that we intended to file an NDA, we incurred an additional $12.5 million milestone payment obligation. Upon regulatory approval by the FDA of an NDA, we will owe AstraZeneca an additional $30.0 million. Subsequent to this milestone, we are also obligated to make a series of additional contingent milestone payments totaling up to an additional $30.0 million upon the achievement of regulatory filing milestones. If we elect to develop brensocatib for a second indication, we will be obligated to make an additional series of contingent milestone payments totaling up to $42.5 million, the first of which occurs at the initiation of a Phase 3 trial in the additional indication. We are not obligated to make any additional milestone payments for additional indications. In addition, we have agreed to pay AstraZeneca tiered royalties ranging from a high single-digit to mid-teens on net sales of any approved product based on brensocatib and one additional payment of $35.0 million upon the first achievement of $1.0 billion in annual net sales. The AZ License Agreement provides AstraZeneca with the option to negotiate a future agreement with us for commercialization of brensocatib in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. If we fail to comply with our obligations under our agreements with AstraZeneca (including, among other things, if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a product based on brensocatib, or we are subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency), AstraZeneca would have the right to terminate the license.\nIn March 2020, AstraZeneca exercised its first option pursuant to our October 2016 license agreement under which AstraZeneca can advance clinical development of brensocatib in the indications of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Under the terms of the agreement, upon exercise of this option, AstraZeneca became solely responsible for all aspects of the development of brensocatib up to and including Phase 2b clinical trials in COPD or asthma. In March 2024, AstraZeneca exercised its second and final option under the agreement to further develop brensocatib beyond Phase 2b clinical trials and, if approved, commercialize brensocatib in the indications of COPD or asthma, upon reaching agreement after good faith negotiations resulting in terms, including financial terms, satisfactory to us and to AstraZeneca for such further development and commercialization. In June 2024, the negotiation period following such exercise of the final option expired. No agreement was reached between us and AstraZeneca to permit AstraZeneca to further develop and, if approved, commercialize brensocatib in the indications of COPD or asthma. As a result, we retain full worldwide development and commercialization rights for brensocatib in all indications other than COPD or asthma and AstraZeneca has no further development or commercialization rights for brensocatib in COPD, asthma or any other indication.\nPatheon Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher) and related agreements\nIn January 2024, we entered into certain agreements with Patheon Inc. related to the manufacture and supply of brensocatib by Patheon Inc. for our anticipated long-term commercial needs. Under these agreements, we are required to deliver to Patheon Inc. the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to manufacture brensocatib. Our master commercial manufacturing services agreement with Patheon Inc. will remain in effect for a fixed initial term, after which it will continue for successive renewal terms unless either we or Patheon Inc. have given written notice of termination. The agreements may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach of the other party or the other party’s insolvency. Patheon Inc.'s supply obligations are governed by individual product agreements entered into from \ntime to time under the master commercial manufacturing services agreement. The product agreements specify, among other things, the term and pricing for Patheon Inc.’s supply obligations. \nEsteve Química, S.A.\nIn September 2024, we entered into a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Esteve for the manufacture and supply of brensocatib's active pharmaceutical ingredient. The commercial manufacturing and supply agreement has an initial term of three years, after which it will continue for successive 12-month renewal terms unless either we or Esteve have given written notice of termination. The agreement may also be terminated under certain other circumstances, including by either party due to a material uncured breach of the other party or the other party’s insolvency, the discontinue of specified dosages or changes in the regulatory landscape. Esteve’s supply obligations are based on rolling forecasts of our anticipated demand for brensocatib. \nCompetition\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. We face potential competitors from many different areas including commercial pharmaceutical, biotechnology and device companies, academic institutions and scientists, other smaller or earlier stage companies and non-profit organizations developing anti-infective drugs and drugs for respiratory, inflammatory, immunology, oncology, and rare diseases. Many of these companies have greater human and financial resources and may have product candidates in more advanced stages of development and may reach the market before our product candidates. Competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer or less expensive or that have better tolerability or convenience. We also may face generic competitors where third-party payors will encourage use of the generic products. Although we believe that our formulation delivery technology, respiratory and anti-infective expertise, experience and knowledge in our specific areas of focus provide us with competitive advantages, these potential competitors could reduce our commercial opportunity. Additionally, there currently are, and in the future there may be, already-approved products for certain of the indications for which we are developing, or in the future may choose to develop, product candidates. For instance, PAH is a competitive indication with established marketed products, including other formulations of treprostinil.\nIn the lung disease market, our major competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that have approved therapies or therapies in development for the treatment of chronic lung infections. There are other companies that are currently conducting clinical trials for the treatment of lung disease. While there are currently no approved treatments for bronchiectasis, clinical studies in this disease state and specific endotypes (for instance, bronchiectasis with eosinophilic inflammation) have been initiated. Certain entities have expressed interest in studying other DPP1 inhibitors for the treatment of bronchiectasis and we are aware of at least two entities currently conducting clinical trials for the treatment of bronchiectasis with a DPP1 inhibitor. Products developed by certain of our competitors may potentially be used in combination with brensocatib, if approved.\nWith regard to ARIKAYCE, we are not aware of any approved inhaled therapies specifically indicated for refractory NTM lung infections in North America, Europe or Japan, but there is a recommended treatment regimen that is utilized. The international treatment guidelines, which are issued by the ATS, ERS, ESCMID and IDSA, strongly recommend the use of ARIKAYCE for the treatment of patients with refractory NTM lung disease caused by MAC as a part of a combination antibacterial drug regiment for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options who have failed to convert to a negative sputum culture after at least six months of treatment. \nThe fields of gene therapy and protein engineering are rapidly advancing and highly competitive. While we believe our internal expertise provides a competitive advantage, we expect competition to intensify, including from other pharmaceutical companies, government agencies and public and private research institutions. If any of our gene therapy or protein engineering programs are approved for their indications, we expect to compete with other gene therapy products, protein engineering technologies and any other existing or new therapies or technologies that may become available in the future. \nGovernment Regulation\nOrphan Drug Designation\nUnited States\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act (ODA), the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition for which the drug is intended affects fewer than 200,000 people in the US or for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the US a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from US sales of such drug, if it meets certain criteria specified by the ODA and FDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the drug and the specific intended use(s) for which it has obtained designation are listed by the FDA in a publicly accessible database. The FDA designated ARIKAYCE as an orphan drug for treatment of NTM infections, bronchiectasis in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other susceptible microbial pathogens, and bronchopulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in CF patients. However, the orphan drug designations for \nbronchiectasis in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or other susceptible microbial pathogens and bronchopulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in CF patients were withdrawn at our request in August 2023. \nOrphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor for various development incentives of the ODA, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and a waiver of the PDUFA application fee (unless the application seeks approval for an indication not included in the orphan drug designation). Orphan drug designation also may afford the company a period of exclusivity for the orphan indication upon approval of the drug. Specifically, the first NDA or biologics license application (BLA) applicant with an FDA orphan drug designation for a particular drug to receive FDA approval of the drug for an indication covered by the orphan designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period, often referred to as orphan drug exclusivity, in the US for that drug in that indication. A product that has several separate orphan designations may have several separate exclusivities for separate orphan indications. During the orphan drug exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for use, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product that has orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition or the same drug for a different disease or condition, and it does not alter the timing or scope of the regulatory review and approval process; the sponsor must still submit evidence from clinical and non-clinical studies sufficient to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug.\nIn a decision issued in September 2021 (Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Becerra), the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the FDA had erred by limiting the scope of orphan drug exclusivity for FIRDAPSE® (amifampridine) to the product’s approved indication, an action that the FDA taken in accordance with its regulations interpreting the ODA. The court held that under the ODA, FIRDAPSE’s orphan drug exclusivity instead protected the broader rare disease or condition that received orphan drug designation. Notwithstanding the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Catalyst, the FDA announced in January 2023 that it would continue to apply the FDA’s regulations tying the scope of orphan drug exclusivity to a product’s approved uses or indications. In light of the FDA’s announcement, the scope of orphan drug exclusivity and other issues relating to the FDA’s implementation of the ODA with respect to previously approved and future products may be the subject of further litigation or legislative action.\nEuropean Union\nThe EMA grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of drugs or biologics (1) for life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, or (2) for life threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU where, without incentives, sales of the drug in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway) (EEA) are unlikely to be sufficient to justify its development. Orphan drug designation is available either if no other satisfactory method of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition is approved in the EEA or if such a method does exist but the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients. \nIf a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives an orphan drug marketing authorization from the EC for a therapeutic indication which is covered by such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan exclusivity. The EC has granted an orphan drug marketing authorization for ARIKAYCE for the treatment of NTM lung infections caused by MAC in adults with limited treatment options who do not have CF. Orphan exclusivity means that the EMA or a national medicines agency may not accept another application for authorization, or grant an authorization, for a same or similar drug for the same therapeutic indication. Competitors may receive such a marketing authorization despite orphan exclusivity, provided that they demonstrate that the existing orphan product is not supplied in sufficient quantities or that the 'second' drug or biologic is clinically superior to the existing orphan product. The 'second' drug may but need not have an orphan designation as well. The period of orphan exclusivity is 10 years, which can be extended by two years where an agreed pediatric investigation plan has been implemented. The exclusivity period may also be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Each orphan designated marketing authorization carries the potential for one market exclusivity for all the therapeutic indications that are covered by the designation. Market exclusivity is an orphan incentive awarded by the EC to a specific clinical indication with an orphan designation. Each indication with an orphan designation confers ten years of market exclusivity for the particular indication. A medicine that has multiple orphan designations for different conditions may benefit from separate market exclusivity periods pertaining to its different orphan designations. \nOrphan drug designation also provides opportunities for free protocol assistance and fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedure or fee exemptions for companies with a small and medium enterprises status. In addition, EU Member States may provide national benefits to orphan drugs, such as early access to the reimbursement procedure or exemption from any turnover tax imposed on pharmaceutical companies.\nThe orphan designation may be applied for at any time during the development of the drug but before the application for marketing authorization. At the time of marketing authorization, the criteria for orphan designation are examined again, and the EC decides on the maintenance of the orphan designation in granting an orphan drug marketing authorization. The non-maintenance of the orphan designation means that the drug loses its orphan status and thus no longer benefits from orphan exclusivity, fee reductions or exemptions, and national benefits.\nJapan\nThe MHLW may, after hearing the opinion of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council, grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition if the drug meets the following conditions: (i) the number of target patients is less than 50,000 in Japan; (ii) the necessity of orphan drug designation is high from a medical point of view; and (iii) the plan for development of the drug is appropriate. Even if a drug is granted orphan drug designation, however, it does not always receive the manufacturing and marketing approval that is necessary for the drug to be sold or marketed in Japan. ARIKAYCE did not qualify for orphan drug designation in Japan due to the estimated number of NTM patients in Japan exceeding 50,000.\nDrug Approval\nUnited States\nIn the US, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other government bodies. The US Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), the Public Health Services Act (PHSA) (in the case of biological products), and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable US requirements at any time during product development, approval, or after approval may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as imposition of clinical holds, FDA refusal to file or approve NDAs or BLAs, warning letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The description below summarizes the current approval process in the US for our product and product candidates.\nPreclinical Studies\nPreclinical studies may include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, and pharmacology, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including the FDA's good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations and the US Department of Agriculture's regulations implementing the Animal Welfare Act. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical trial protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Certain non-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND might not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.\nClinical Trials\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects (healthy volunteers or patients) under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted (i) in compliance with all applicable federal regulations and guidance, including those pertaining to good clinical practice (GCP) standards that are meant to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors as well as (ii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing of a new drug in the US (whether in patients or healthy volunteers) must be included as a submission to the IND, and the FDA must be notified of subsequent protocol amendments, including new protocols. In addition, the protocol must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (IRB), and all study subjects must provide informed consent. Typically, before any clinical trial, each institution participating in the trial will require review of the protocol before the trial commences at that institution. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and there are additional, more frequent reporting requirements for certain AEs.\nA study sponsor might choose to discontinue a clinical trial or a clinical development program for a variety of reasons. The FDA may impose a temporary or permanent clinical hold, or other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. An IRB also may require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions.\nClinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential pre-approval phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, short term (typically less than a few months) testing is conducted in a small group of subjects (typically 20-100), who may be patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers, to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects. In Phase 2, the drug is given to a \nlarger group of subjects (typically up to several hundred) with the target condition to further evaluate its safety and gather preliminary evidence of efficacy. Phase 3 studies typically last between several months and two years. In Phase 3, the drug is given to a large group of subjects with the target disease or condition (typically several hundred to several thousand), often at multiple geographical sites, to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, and collect data to support drug approval. Only a small percentage of investigational drugs complete all three phases of development and obtain marketing approval.\nNDAs and BLAs\nAfter completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA can be prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the US. The NDA or BLA is a large submission that must include, among other things, the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The application also includes representative samples, copies of the proposed product labeling, patent information, and a financial certification or disclosure statement. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. Additionally, under federal law (as amended by the most recent reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA VII) in the FDA User Fee Reauthorization Act of 2022), most NDAs and BLAs are subject to a substantial application fee and, upon approval, the applicant will be assessed an annual prescription drug program fee, both of which are adjusted annually. NDAs and BLAs for orphan drugs are not subject to an application fee, unless the application includes an indication other than an orphan-designated indication. The FDA also has the authority to grant waivers of certain user fees, pursuant to the FDCA.\nThe FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application is accepted for filing based on the FDA's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes outside clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.\nBefore approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug or biological product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless, among other requirements, compliance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence of effectiveness for the proposed indication, generally consisting of adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations, and that the drug is safe for use under the conditions of use in the proposed labeling. The FDA also reviews the proposed labeling submitted with the NDA or BLA and typically requires changes in the labeling text.\nAfter the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing and testing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. Complete response letters generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and delineate the additional testing or information needed in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter, which may specify post approval requirements, authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biological product for the approved indication or indications and the other conditions of use set out in the approved prescribing information. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. The FDA sets a goal date by which the FDA expects to issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter, unless the review period is adjusted by mutual agreement between the FDA and the applicant or as a result of the applicant submitting a major amendment. The FDA's current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) NDAs and BLAs within 10 months of the end of the 60-day filing review period and priority NDAs and BLAs within six months of the end of the 60-day filing review period (in the case of new molecular entity (NME) NDA and original BLA submissions). For non-NME NDA/BLAs the FDA's current performance goals call for the FDA to complete review of 90 percent of standard (non-priority) NDAs and BLAs within 10 months of receipt and priority NDAs and BLAs within 6 months of receipt. \nAs a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing, known as Phase 4 studies, to be conducted in order to gather additional information on the drug's effect in various populations and any side effects. Beyond routine post marketing safety surveillance, the FDA may require specific additional surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions that can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. As a condition of approval, or after approval, the FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) or a REMS with elements to assure safe use to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS may include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. Further post-approval requirements are discussed below.\nExpedited Review and Approval of Eligible Drugs\nUnder the FDA's accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve certain drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, which can substantially reduce time to approval. A surrogate endpoint used for accelerated approval is a marker—a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity and mortality (IMM) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. The FDA bases its decision on whether to accept the proposed surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint on the scientific support for that endpoint.\nAs a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA typically requires certain post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe clinical benefit of the product, and may impose restrictions on distribution to assure safe use. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Congress gave FDA the authority to require, as appropriate, that a confirmatory trial be underway prior to accelerated approval or within a specified time period after the date of accelerated approval. In addition, promotional materials for an accelerated approval drug to be used in the first 120 days post-approval must be submitted to the FDA prior to approval, and materials to be used after that 120-day period must be submitted 30 days prior to first use. If the required post-marketing studies fail to verify the clinical benefit of the drug, or if the applicant fails to perform the required post-marketing studies with due diligence, the FDA may withdraw approval of the drug under streamlined procedures in accordance with the FDCA, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. The agency may also withdraw approval of a drug if, among other things, the promotional materials for the product are false or misleading, or other evidence demonstrates that the drug product is not shown to be safe or effective under its conditions of use.\nThe FDA also has various programs—fast track designation, priority review and breakthrough designation—that are intended to expedite or streamline the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that meet certain qualifications. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. The programs each have different eligibility criteria and provide different benefits, and can be applied either alone or in combination depending on an applicant's circumstances.\nFast track designation applies to a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and for which nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical need. It should be requested at the time of IND submission or ideally no later than the pre-NDA or pre-BLA meeting. The FDA must respond to requests for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the request. If granted, the applicant is eligible for actions to expedite development and review, such as frequent interaction with the review team, as well as rolling review, meaning that the applicant may submit sections of the application as they are available. The timing of the FDA's review of these sections depends on a number of factors, and the review clock does not start running until the agency has received a complete NDA or BLA submission. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if the agency determines that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the drug development process.\nPriority review applies to an application (both original and efficacy supplement) for a drug that treats a serious condition and that, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. It also applies to any supplement that proposes a labeling change pursuant to a report on a pediatric study conducted pursuant to section 505A of the FDCA. A request for priority review is submitted at the time of submission of an NDA or BLA, or supplemental NDA or BLA. The FDA must respond within 60 days of receipt of the request. If granted, the review time is shortened from the standard 10 months to 6 months, beginning either after the 60-day filing review period (in the case of NME NDA and original BLA submissions) or the date of receipt (in the case of non-NME original NDA submissions).\nBreakthrough therapy designation applies to a drug that is intended to treat a serious condition and for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement on a clinically significant endpoint(s) over available therapies. It can be requested with the IND submission and ideally no later than the end-of-Phase 2 meeting. The FDA must respond within 60 days of receipt of the request. If granted, the applicant receives intensive guidance on efficient drug development, intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced review and regulatory health project management staff in a proactive, collaborative, cross-disciplinary review, rolling review, and other actions to expedite review. Designation may be rescinded if the product no longer meets the criteria for breakthrough therapy designation.\nDrugs that are designated as QIDPs may be eligible for priority review and will receive fast track designation upon the request of the sponsor, and also may be eligible for market exclusivity. A product is eligible for QIDP designation if it is an antibacterial or anti-fungal drug for human use that is intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including: those caused by an anti-bacterial or anti-fungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens; or caused by qualifying pathogens listed by the FDA. A drug sponsor may request that the FDA designate its product as a QIDP at any time prior to NDA submission. \nAdditionally, the FDA may approve eligible drugs under the LPAD. A product is eligible if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening infection in a limited population of patients with unmet needs, the drug otherwise meets the standards of approval, and the FDA receives a written request from the sponsor to approve the drug under this pathway. An antibacterial or anti-fungal drug approved through this pathway may follow a streamlined clinical development program involving smaller, shorter, or fewer clinical trials. Approval is based on a benefit-risk assessment in the intended limited population, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the infection the drug is intended to treat and the availability or lack of alternative treatment for the patient population. Such drugs might not have favorable benefit-risk profiles in a broader population. Drugs approved under LPAD are subject to additional regulatory requirements, including labeling and advertising statements regarding the limited population and submission of promotional materials to the FDA at least 30 days prior to dissemination. The FDA may remove these additional requirements if the agency approves the drug for a broader population.\nExclusivities\nIn the US, after NDA or BLA approval of a drug not previously approved, owners of relevant drug patents may obtain up to a five-year patent term extension on a single patent. The allowable patent term extension is generally calculated as half of the drug's testing phase (the time between the date the IND becomes effective and the NDA or BLA submission date) and all of the review phase (the time between the NDA or BLA submission date and the approval date) up to a maximum of five years, to the extent such testing phase and approval phase occur after the issue date of the patent. The total post-NDA or BLA approval patent term including the extension may not exceed 14 years. The extension also can be shortened if the FDA determines that the NDA/BLA applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. For patents that might expire while a patent term extension application is pending, the patent owner may request an interim patent term extension. The Director of the USPTO shall extend, until a final determination is made, the term of the patent for periods of up to one year if the Director determines that the patent is eligible for extension. An interim patent term extension may be renewed up to four times until a final determination is made, and up to the amount of time for which the patent might be eligible for extension. For each interim patent term extension granted, the final patent term extension is reduced by a corresponding amount. Interim patent extensions may also be available for a patent that will expire before a drug is expected to be approved, but the NDA or BLA for the drug must have been submitted.\nA variety of non-patent exclusivity periods are available under the FDCA that can delay the submission or approval of certain applications for competing products.\nA five-year period of non-patent exclusivity within the US is granted to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity (NCE). An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety (the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance) that has been approved by the FDA in any other application submitted under section 505(b) of the FDCA. During the exclusivity period for an NCE, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated NDA (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references (i.e., relies on the FDA's prior approval of) the NCE drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement with respect to a patent listed with the FDA for the NCE drug.\nA three-year period of non-patent exclusivity is granted for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved, when the application contains reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the sponsor that were essential to approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations, which means that the FDA may approve ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for other versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Where this form of exclusivity applies, it prevents FDA approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that is subject to the exclusivity for the three-year period; however, the FDA may accept and review ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs during the three-year period.\nThese exclusivities also do not preclude FDA approval of a 505(b)(1) NDA for a duplicate version of the approved drug during the period of exclusivity, provided that the follow-on applicant conducts or obtains a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.\nProducts with QIDP designation may receive a five-year extension of other non-patent exclusivities for which the drug is also eligible, subject to certain limitations. Depending upon the scope of the non-patent exclusivity that is extended, the five-year extension might not prevent the FDA from approving a subsequent application for a change to the QIDP-designated drug that results in, for example, a new indication, route of administration, dosing, schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device, or strength. A drug that has been designated as both an orphan drug and a QIDP for the same indication, like ARIKAYCE, might be eligible for a combined 12 years of exclusivity for that indication.\nUnder the PHSA, the FDA recognizes reference product exclusivity starting from the first licensure of a biological product. Reference product exclusivity affects the timing of submission and approval of a BLA for a biosimilar product. Under section 351(k) of the PHSA, a BLA for a biosimilar product may be approved based upon a showing that the proposed product is highly similar to a previously licensed product, known as the reference product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar product and \nthe reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Reference product exclusivity prevents the FDA from accepting a BLA submitted under section 351(k) of the PHSA for a proposed biosimilar product for 4 years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and prevents the FDA from approving such BLA for a proposed biosimilar product for 12 years after such date of first licensure. An additional period of reference product exclusivity is not available upon approval of a supplemental BLA. Moreover, the PHSA limits the availability of reference product exclusivity for a subsequent BLA filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of a biological product (or a licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity).\nMedical Device Regulation\nMedical devices, such as Lamira, may be marketed as stand-alone devices, or in some cases, as constituent parts of a combination product. In either case, the product will need to satisfy and comply with FDA requirements. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the US requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, approval of a premarket approval application (PMA), or issuance of a de novo classification order. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes -- Class I, Class II or Class III -- depending on the degree of risk and the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of each medical device. Medical devices deemed to pose lower risks are generally placed in either Class I or II.\nWhile most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or many implantable devices, or devices that have been found not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class I or Class II predicate device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. De novo classification is a risk-based classification process to classify novel medical devices into Class I or Class II.\nMedical devices are also subject to certain postmarket requirements. Those requirements include, for example, establishment registration and device listing; compliance with the requirements of the Quality System Regulation (QSR); medical device reporting regulations; correction and removal reporting regulations; compliance with requirements for Unique Device Identification; and post-market surveillance activities and obligations. Device manufacturers must also comply with FDA requirements regarding promotion, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced, and that all claims are substantiated, and prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses. \nMedical device manufacturers must demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA’s QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of medical devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic inspections and unannounced “for cause” inspections. In January 2024, the FDA issued a final rule amending the QSR to align more closely with the international consensus standard for Quality Management Systems for medical devices used by many other regulatory authorities around the world, ISO 13485:2016. The revised regulation is referred to as the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR) and becomes effective on January 2, 2026. The FDA made conforming edits to the combination product regulation to clarify the device Quality Management System (QMS) requirements for combination products.\nThe FDCA permits medical devices intended for investigational use to be shipped to clinical sites if such devices comply with prescribed procedures and conditions. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of study review and approval, informed consent, recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. \nFailure to comply with applicable regulations could result in enforcement actions such as: warning letters; fines; injunctions; civil penalties; inability to distribute products; recalls or seizures of products; delays in the introduction of products into the market; total or partial suspension of production; FDA refusal to grant, or delay in obtaining, marketing authorizations; and in the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nCombination Products\nA combination product is a product comprising two or more regulated components (e.g., a drug and device) that are combined into a single product, co-packaged, or sold separately but intended for co-administration, as evidenced by the labeling for the products. Drugs that are administered using a nebulizer or another device, such as ARIKAYCE or TPIP, are examples of drug/device combination products.\nThe FDA is divided into various Centers, which each have authority over a specific type of product. NDAs are reviewed by personnel within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, while device applications, premarket notifications, and de novo authorization requests are reviewed by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Combination products, such as drug/device combinations, are typically reviewed through a marketing submission that corresponds to the constituent part which provides the product's primary mode of action (PMOA), i.e., is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. If the PMOA is unclear or in dispute, a sponsor may file a Request for \nDesignation with the FDA’s Office of Combination Products (OCP), which will render a determination and assign a lead Center. OCP generally assigns jurisdiction based on PMOA. If it is not possible to determine which one mode of action will provide a greater contribution than any other mode of action to the overall therapeutic effects of the combination product, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions. When there are no other combination products that present similar questions of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole, the agency will assign the combination product to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. \nWhen evaluating an application or other marketing submission for a combination product, a lead Center may consult other Centers, or it may assign review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Depending on the type of combination product, approval or clearance could be obtained through submission of a single marketing application or through separate applications for the individual constituent parts (e.g., an NDA for the drug and a premarket notification for the device). The FDCA directs the FDA to conduct a review of a combination product under a single marketing application whenever appropriate. Applicants may choose to submit separate applications for constituent parts of a combination product (unless the FDA determines one application is necessary), and in limited situations, the FDA may determine an application for each constituent part is warranted. One reason to submit multiple applications is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each application is generally reviewed by the Center with authority over each application type. For combination products that contain an approved constituent part (such as a drug-device combination product in which the device has previously received clearance), the FDA may require that the application(s) include only such information as is necessary to meet the standard for clearance or approval, using a risk-based approach and taking into account any prior finding of safety or effectiveness for the approved constituent part.\nLike their constituent products—e.g., drugs and devices—combination products are highly regulated and subject to a broad range of post marketing requirements including cGMP, adverse event reporting, periodic reports, labeling and advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in enforcement actions.\nDisclosure of Clinical Trial Information\nUnder US and certain foreign laws intended to improve clinical trial transparency, sponsors of clinical trials may be required to register and disclose certain information about their clinical trials. This can include information related to the investigational drug, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial. This information is then made publicly available. Under US regulations, sponsors are obligated to disclose the results of these trials after completion. In the US, disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years if the sponsor is seeking initial approval of the product or approval of a new indication. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.\nOther Post-approval Regulatory Requirements\nOnce an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements, including those relating to advertising, promotion, adverse event reporting, recordkeeping, and cGMP, as well as registration, listing, and inspection. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements.\nThe FDA regulates the content and format of prescription drug labeling, advertising, and promotion, including direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional Internet communications. The FDA also establishes parameters for permissible non-promotional communications between industry and the medical community, including industry-supported scientific and educational activities. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion for uses not consistent with the approved labeling, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses or otherwise not to have met applicable promotion rules may be subject to significant liability under the FDCA, the PHSA, and other statutes, including the False Claims Act.\nManufacturers are subject to requirements for adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA.\nAll aspects of pharmaceutical manufacture must conform to cGMP after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA during which the FDA inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. \nAccordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP.\nDrugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, product formulation, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement, in some cases before the change may be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs.\nAs previously mentioned, the FDA also may require Phase 4 studies and may require a REMS, which could restrict the distribution or use of the product.\nIn addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA), which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.\nEuropean Union\nMarketing Authorization Application\nTo obtain approval of a drug under the EU regulatory system, an application for a marketing authorization may be submitted under a centralized, a decentralized or a national procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes or for orphan drugs, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states, which grants the same rights and obligations in each member state as a national marketing authorization. As a general rule, only one marketing authorization may be granted for drugs approved through the centralized procedure and the marketing authorization is also relevant for the EEA countries.\nUnder the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is required to adopt an opinion on a valid application within 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions. More specifically, on day 80 of the procedure, the Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur generate their draft assessment report. This is followed at day 120 by issuing to the applicant their formal report and a list questions. Applicants then have up to three months to respond to the questions (and can request a three-month extension). The Rapporteur, Co-Rapporteur and CHMP assess the applicant's replies and at day 150 generate their Joint Assessment Report. At day 180, the Joint Assessment Report along with a list of outstanding issues for unresolved matters (as needed) is provided to the applicant. Applicants then have one month to respond to the CHMP (and can request a one or two-month extension). At day 180 the CHMP can also request the involvement of a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), where the applicant is given the opportunity to present data supporting the application and addressing the specific questions addressed by the CHMP to the SAG. If the outstanding issues remain, an oral explanation may be requested by the EMA, where the applicant must attend the CHMP plenary session and address the Major Objections related to approval of the marketing authorization application (MAA). The CHMP members can then question the applicant on the key issues. At day 210, once its scientific evaluation is completed, the CHMP gives a favorable or unfavorable opinion as to whether to grant the marketing authorization. After the adoption of the CHMP opinion, a decision must be adopted by the EC, after consulting the Standing Committee of the Member States. The EC prepares a draft decision and circulates it to the member states; if the draft decision differs from the CHMP opinion, the Commission must provide detailed explanations. The EC adopts a decision within 15 days of the end of the consultation procedure.\nAccelerated Procedure, Conditional Approval and Approval Under Exceptional Circumstances\nVarious programs, including accelerated assessment, conditional approval and approval under exceptional circumstances, are intended to expedite or simplify the approval of drugs that meet certain qualifications. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard approval procedures.\nFor drugs which are of major interest from the point of view of public health, in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, applicants may submit a substantiated request for accelerated assessment. If the CHMP accepts the request, the review time is reduced from 210 to 150 days.\nFurthermore, for certain categories of medicinal products, marketing authorizations may be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs of patients or in the interest of public health. In such cases, the company may request, or the CHMP may recommend, the granting of a marketing authorization, subject to certain specific obligations; such marketing authorization may be conditional or under exceptional circumstances. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to applications for a conditional marketing authorization or marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances.\nConditional marketing authorizations may be granted for products designated as orphan medicinal products, if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) the applicant will likely be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs, and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.\nConditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, on a renewable basis until the holder provides a comprehensive data package. The granting of conditional marketing authorization depends on the applicant's ability to fulfill the conditions imposed within the agreed upon deadline. They are subject to \"conditions\", i.e., the holder is required to complete ongoing studies or to conduct new studies with a view to confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive or to fulfill specific obligations in relation to pharmacovigilance. Once the holder has provided a comprehensive data package, the conditional marketing authorization is replaced by a 'regular' marketing authorization.\nMarketing authorizations under exceptional circumstances may be granted where the applicant demonstrates that, for objective and verifiable reasons, they are unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety of the drug under normal conditions of use. Such marketing authorizations are subject to certain conditions, in particular relating to safety of the drug, notification of incidents relating to its use or actions to be taken. They are valid for an indefinite period of time, but the conditions upon which they are based are subject to an annual reassessment in order to ensure that the risk-benefit balance remains positive.\nExclusivities\nIf an approved drug contains a new active substance, it is protected by data exclusivity for eight years from the notification of the Commission decision granting the marketing authorization and then by marketing protection for an additional two or three years. Overall, the drug is protected for ten or eleven years against generic competition, and no additional exclusivity protection is granted for any new development of the active substance it contains.\nDuring the eight-year period of data exclusivity, competitors may not refer to the marketing authorization dossier of the approved drug for regulatory purposes. During the period of marketing protection, competitors may not market their generic drugs. The period of marketing protection is normally two years but may become three years if, during the eight-year data exclusivity period, a new therapeutic indication is approved that is considered as bringing a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies.\nMedical Devices Regulations\nIn May 2017, the EU adopted a new Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR), which repealed and replaced Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices (Directive 93/42) on May 26, 2021. The MDR and its associated guidance documents and harmonized standards, govern, among other things, device design and development, preclinical and clinical or performance testing, premarket conformity assessment, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, claims, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance, vigilance, and market surveillance. \nAs of May 26, 2021, before a device can be placed on the market in the EU, compliance with the MDR requirements (i.e., the General Safety and Performance Requirements, or GSPRs, set out in Annex I of the MDR) must be demonstrated in order to affix the Conformité Européene mark, or CE Mark, to the product. The MDR provides recourse to harmonized European standards in order to facilitate compliance with the GSPRs. Harmonized standards provide a presumption of conformity with the GSPRs (although there are a limited number of standards harmonized currently). However, under transitional provisions provided for in the MDR, medical devices with Notified Body certificates issued under Directive 93/42 prior to May 26, 2021 may continue to be placed on the market for the remaining validity of the certificate, until December 31, 2027 at the latest for higher risk medical devices and until December 31, 2028 for other medical devices, in each case, so long as there is no significant changes in the design or intended purpose. After the expiry of any applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked under the MDR may be placed on the market in the EU.\nTo demonstrate compliance with these requirements, a conformity assessment procedure is required. The MDR provides for several conformity assessment procedures, which depends on the type of medical device and the risks involved. Devices are divided in four groups based on risk: Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb, and Class III. Class I devices present the lowest level of risk so that, for most of these devices (other than those that are sterile and/or have measuring functionality) the manufacturer can self-certify the product plus affix the CE mark. For the other classes, the conformity assessment is carried out by an organization designated and supervised by a member state of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, known as a Notified Body. The manufacturer initially classifies every device. However, when a device undergoes a conformity assessment with a Notified Body, the Notified Body may dispute the classification and assert that the device should be included in a class requiring stricter conformity assessment procedures. Specific rules apply to custom-made medical devices, medical devices that are used in clinical trials, and medical devices that incorporate a medicinal ingredient.\nFor classes of devices other than Class I, the Notified Body carries out the conformity assessment and issues a certificate of conformity, which entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its devices after having prepared and signed a related EU Declaration of Conformity. Affixing a CE mark allows the product to move freely within the EU and thus prevents EU Member States from restricting sales and marketing of the devices, unless such measure is justified on the basis of evidence of non-compliance. Ultimately, the manufacturer is responsible for the conformity of the device with the GSPRs and for the affixing of the CE mark. Lamira is CE marked by PARI, i.e., its manufacturer, in the EU.\nClinical evidence is required for most medium and high risk devices. In some cases, a clinical study may be required to support a CE marking application. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the clinical investigation requirements of the MDR, EU member state requirements, and current good clinical practices defined in harmonized standards and guidance documents.\nAfter a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. The MDR prohibits misleading claims about devices and so devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are approved (although more detailed rules on marketing may be contained in national legislation). For CE marked devices, certain modifications to the device or quality system depending on the conformity assessment procedure used must be submitted to and approved by the Notified Body before placing the modified device on the market. \nEconomic Operators, include device manufactures, must register their establishments and devices in the EUDAMED database once available. Manufacturers of medical devices are subject to vigilance obligations that require reporting of incidents and are required to implement a post-marketing surveillance system (for monitoring data about the device and confirming the benefits of the device outweigh the risks). The vigilance obligations require that manufacturers must report serious incidents involving the device made available in the EU and any field safety corrective actions in respect of the device made available in the EU (including actions taken outside the EU) to relevant competent authorities. In addition, Notified Bodies regularly reassess the conformity of a medical device to the GSPRs and may from time to time audit the manufacturer and may, where needed, suspend or withdraw the manufacturer's certificate of conformity.\nJapan\nUnder the Japanese regulatory system administered by the MHLW and the PMDA (which is responsible for product review and evaluations under the supervision of the MHLW), in principle, pre-marketing approval and clinical studies are required for all pharmaceutical products. The Law on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products Including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices (Act No. 145 of 1960) requires a license for marketing authorization when importing to Japan and selling pharmaceutical products manufactured in other countries, a holder of such license is referred to as a marketing authorization holder. It also requires a foreign manufacturer to get each of its manufacturing sites certified as a manufacturing site of pharmaceutical products to be marketed in Japan. To receive a license for marketing authorization, the manufacturer or seller must, at the very least, employ certain manufacturing marketing, quality and safety personnel. A license for marketing authorization may not be granted if the quality management methods and post marketing safety management methods applied with respect to the pharmaceutical product fail to conform to the standards stipulated in the ordinances promulgated by the MHLW. To obtain manufacturing/marketing approval for a new product, a Company must submit an application for approval to the MHLW with results of CMC, nonclinical and clinical studies to show the quality, efficacy and safety of the product candidate. A data compliance review, on-site inspection for good clinical practice, audit and detailed data review for compliance with current good manufacturing practices are undertaken by the PMDA. The application is then discussed by the committees of the Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council. Based on the results of these reviews, the final decision on approval is made by the MHLW. The time required for the approval process varies depending on the product. PMDA's target review period (submission to approval) is twelve months (standard review) and nine months (priority review), although this is not a commitment. The product also needs approval for pricing in order to be eligible for reimbursement under Japan's National Health Insurance system. The medical products which, once they are approved and marketed, are subject to the continuing standards of Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Quality Practice and are also subject to regular post-marketing vigilance of safety and quality under the standards of Good Vigilance Practice and Good Post-marketing Study Practice. In Japan, the National Health Insurance system maintains a Drug Price List specifying which pharmaceutical products are eligible for reimbursement, and the MHLW sets the prices of the products on this list. After receipt of marketing approval, negotiations regarding the reimbursement price with the MHLW would begin. Price would be determined within 60 to 90 days following receipt of marketing approval unless the applicant disagrees, which may result in extended pricing negotiations. The government is currently introducing price cut rounds every year and mandates price decreases for specific products. New products judged innovative or useful, that are indicated for pediatric use, or that target orphan or small population diseases, however, may be eligible for a pricing premium. Price revisions after product launch based on Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) were introduced in 2019. Products meeting the relevant criteria may have their prices adjusted according to the outcomes of the HTA/CEA evaluation. Additionally, certain rules for post-launch price reductions, such as Repricing for Market Expansion, are also applied. The government has also promoted the use of generics, where available.\nPediatric Information\nUnited States\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA), as amended, certain NDAs, BLAs, and supplements must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of an applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, and subject to an exception for certain oncology drugs, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), pediatric research is incentivized by the possibility of six months of pediatric exclusivity, which if granted, is added to existing statutory and patent-based exclusivity periods listed for the applicable drug in the FDA's Orange Book at the time the FDA determines that the sponsor has satisfied the FDA's \"written request\" for pediatric research, provided that the FDA makes such determination at least nine months before the expiration of such exclusivity period. Sponsors may seek to negotiate the terms of a written request during drug development. While the sponsor of an orphan-designated drug may not be required to perform pediatric studies under PREA unless one of the above exceptions applies, they are eligible to participate in the incentives under the BPCA if the FDA issues a written request.\nEuropean Union\nIn the EU, new drugs (i.e., drugs containing a new active substance) for adults must also be tested in children. \nThis can also include pediatric pharmaceutical forms, in all subsets of the pediatric population. The mandatory pediatric testing is carried out through the implementation of a pediatric investigation plan (PIP), which is proposed by the applicant and approved by the EMA. A PIP contains all the studies to be conducted and measures to be taken in order to support the approval of the new drug, including pediatric pharmaceutical forms, in all subsets of the pediatric population. Implementation of a PIP is a prerequisite to validation of an MAA. Following granting of the marketing authorization, post approval compliance is also reviewed through the life cycle of the product until the PIP is completed. A PIP may allow for one or more waivers or deferral for one or more of the studies or measures included therein in order not to delay the approval of the drug in adults, and, on another hand, the EMA may grant either a product-specific waiver for the (adult) disease/condition or one or more pediatric subsets or a class waiver for the disease/condition. PIPs are subject to potential modifications from time to time, when they no longer are workable, if approved by EMA. Any new indication as a variation to an existing marketing authorization requires a new PIP for that indication. In the case of orphan medicinal products, completion of an approved PIP can result in an extension of the market exclusivity period from ten to twelve years. To benefit from the additional exclusivity the PIP must be completed and content from the PIP must be included in the approved summary of product characteristics.\nJapan\nIn Japan, there is no statutory rule which imposes any different obligation on pharmaceutical manufacturers engaging in pediatric drug development than on other pharmaceutical manufacturers. However, the guidelines of the MHLW (Handling of Pharmaceuticals during the Reexamination Interval Period (Issue No. 107, February 1, 1999) and Enforcement of the Ministerial Ordinance Partially Revising the Ministerial Ordinance on Standards for Post-marketing Surveillance of Pharmaceutical Products and Review of Post-marketing Surveillance for the Reexamination of Pharmaceutical Products (No. 1324, December 27, 2000)) state as follows: (i) since information on pediatric patients obtained in clinical trials may be limited, the MHLW recommends that pharmaceutical manufacturers conduct adequate post-marketing surveillance during the reexamination interval period and collect as much information as possible for proper use of drugs for pediatric patients; and (ii) if a pharmaceutical manufacturer plans to conduct a clinical trial to set the dose of a pediatric drug to prepare application for manufacturing/marketing approval or after receiving the same approval, the reexamination interval period may be extended up to ten years. The notification of MHLW (Partial Revision of Handling of Reexamination Period (Issue No. 0116/3, January 16, 2024)) states that ten years will be applied as the reexamination period for the “addition of clearly different dosage such as pediatric doses.” In addition, since February 2010 the MHLW has convened a study group composed of physicians on a regular basis to discuss and promote the development of children’s drugs that have been approved for use in Europe and the US but are not yet approved in Japan, so that they can be used as early as possible in Japan as well. \nRegulation Outside the US, Europe and Japan\nIn addition to regulations in the US, Europe and Japan, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical studies of our candidate products, including medical devices. Regardless of whether we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the US before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product candidate in those countries. The requirements for approval and the approval process vary from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Under certain harmonized medical device approval/clearance regulations outside the US, reference to US clearance permits fast-tracking of market clearance. Other regions are harmonized with EU standards, and therefore recognize the CE mark as a declaration of conformity to applicable standards. Furthermore, we must obtain any required pricing approvals in addition to regulatory approval prior to launching a product candidate in the approving country. Although the UK is no longer part of the EU, its medicinal product and medical device regulations remain broadly aligned with the EU requirements.\nEarly Access Programs (EAPs)\nCertain countries allow the supply or use of non-authorized medicinal products within strictly regulated EAPs. Some may also provide reimbursement for drugs provided in the context of EAPs. Under EU law, member states are authorized to adopt national legal regimes for the supply or use of non-authorized drugs in case of therapeutic needs. The most common national legal regimes are compassionate use programs and named-patient sales, but other national regimes for early access may be available, depending on the member state. For drugs that must be approved through the centralized procedure, such as orphan drugs, compassionate use programs are also regulated at the European level. ARIKAYCE is available in certain countries under these early access programs.\nSpecial programs can be set up to make available to patients with an unmet medical need a promising drug which has not yet been authorized for their condition (compassionate use). As a general rule, compassionate use programs can only be put in place for drugs or biologics that are expected to help patients with life-threatening, long-lasting or seriously disabling illnesses who currently cannot be treated satisfactorily with authorized medicines, or who have a disease for which no medicine has yet been authorized. The compassionate use route may be a way for patients who cannot enroll in an ongoing clinical trial to obtain treatment with a potentially life-saving medicine. Compassionate use programs are coordinated and implemented by the EU member states, which decide independently how and when to open such programs according to national rules and legislation. These programs are mainly used to treat a group or cohort of patients. Generally, doctors who wish to obtain a promising drug for their seriously ill patients will need to contact the relevant national authority in their respective country and follow the procedure that has been set up. Typically, the national authority keeps a register of the patients treated with the drug within the compassionate use program, and a system is in place to record any side effects reported by the patients or their doctors. Orphan drugs very often are subject to compassionate use programs due to their very nature (rare diseases are life-threatening, long-lasting or seriously disabling diseases) and the long time required for both their approval and effective marketing.\nDoctors can also obtain certain drugs for their patients by requesting a supply of a drug from the manufacturer or a pharmacist located in another country, to be used for an individual patient under their direct responsibility. This is often called treatment on a 'named-patient basis' and is distinct from compassionate use programs. For access via named-patient such medicine should, or must (depending on legislation) be authorized in at least one country, from which it can be imported into the patient’s country under a named-patient access program. In this case, the doctor responsible for the treatment will either contact the manufacturer directly or issue a prescription to be fulfilled by a pharmacist. While manufacturers or pharmacists do record what they supply, there is no central register of the patients that are being treated in this way.\nReimbursement of Pharmaceutical Products\nIn the US, many independent third-party payors, as well as the Medicare and state Medicaid programs, reimburse dispensers of pharmaceutical products. Medicare is the federal program that provides healthcare benefits to senior citizens and certain disabled and chronically ill persons. Medicaid is the need-based federal and state program administered by the states to provide healthcare benefits to certain persons.\nAs one of the conditions for obtaining Medicaid and, if applicable, Medicare Part B coverage for our marketed pharmaceutical products, we will need to agree to pay a rebate to state Medicaid agencies that provide reimbursement for those products. We will also have to agree to sell our commercial products under contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense, Public Health Service, and numerous other federal agencies as well as certain hospitals that are designated by federal statutes to receive drugs at prices that are significantly below the price we charge to commercial pharmaceutical distributors. These programs and contracts are highly regulated and will impose restrictions on our business. Failure to comply with these regulations and restrictions could result in adverse consequences such as civil money penalties, imposition of a Corporate Integrity Agreement and/or a loss of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for our drugs.\nPrivate healthcare payors also attempt to control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payors also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered.\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 (P.L. 117-169) into law. This law will, for the first time, allow Medicare to negotiate the price of certain high expenditure, single source Medicare Part B or Part D drugs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has implemented a Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, and this program may affect future Medicare reimbursement for our drugs. The IRA also requires manufacturers of certain Part B and Part D drugs to issue to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rebates based on certain calculations and triggers (i.e., when drug prices increase and outpace the rate of inflation) which may influence the pricing of current and future products. Drug pricing is an active area for regulatory reform at both the federal and state levels, and additional significant changes to current drug pricing and reimbursement structures in the US could be forthcoming.\nDifferent pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of drugs through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to patients. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which drugs may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drugs, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new drugs. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.\nIn Japan, drugs can be sold on the market if they undergo the PMDA’s review of quality, efficacy and safety and receive manufacturing/marketing approval. However, in order for drugs to be covered by the National Health Insurance, they must be included in a Drug Price List. The \"Drug Pricing Organization,\" which is a division of the Central Social Insurance Medical Council (CSIMC), calculates the price of drugs, the general meeting of the CSIMC approves the calculated price, and the MHLW includes the drugs and the calculated price in the Drug Price List. After receiving manufacturing/marketing approval, drugs are included in the Drug Price List within 60 to 90 days unless the applicant disagrees, which may result in extended pricing negotiations. The MHLW updates the Drug Price List annually after taking into account the survey result of the actual sales price of drugs and hearing the opinion of the CSIMC.\nFraud and Abuse and Other Laws\nPhysicians and other healthcare providers and third-party payors (government or private) often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of healthcare products. In the US and most other jurisdictions, numerous detailed requirements apply to government and private healthcare programs, and a broad range of fraud and abuse laws, transparency laws, and other laws are relevant to pharmaceutical companies. US federal and state healthcare laws and regulations in these areas include the following:\n•The federal Anti-kickback Statute;\n•The federal civil False Claims Act;\n•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act;\n•The federal criminal false statements statute;\n•The price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992;\n•The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program; and\n•Analogous and similar state laws and regulations.\nSimilar restrictions apply in the member states of the EU and Japan, which have been set out by laws or industry codes of conduct. \nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a total of 1,271 full-time employees: 579 in research, clinical, regulatory, medical affairs and quality assurance; 89 in technical operations, manufacturing and quality control; 210 in general and administrative functions; and 393 in commercial activities. We had 1,007 full-time employees in the US, 153 employees in Europe and 111 employees in Japan. We anticipate increasing our headcount in 2025.\nNone of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe that our relations with our employees are generally good. Generally, our US employees are at-will employees; however, we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers.\nHuman Capital\nEmployee Attraction, Retention and Development\nWe are dedicated to attracting and retaining the best possible talent. Our compensation program, including short- and long-term incentives and benefits, is designed to allow us to attract and retain individuals whose skills are critical to our current and long-term success. Total compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the peer market median, with differentiation based on market benchmarks, experience, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent. With our compensation program, we also aim to align the interests of our employees with those of our stockholders.\nWe believe that continued growth and development are essential to the professional well-being of our team. We seek to develop our employee talent within the organization through access to internal and external training, continuous learning programs and other development initiatives. As our organization and capabilities grow, we aim to ensure we have provided our team members with the guidance and resources they need to develop as professionals and to support our business.\nOur Values\nFive core values—collaboration, accountability, passion, respect, and integrity—set the tone for our culture and guide the actions we take each day. We strive to ensure that these values drive all of our human capital endeavors, including hiring, our annual employee feedback process, our Global Core Competencies, our Recognition Program, and our employee onboarding initiatives.\nWe are focused on maintaining an inclusive work environment that best supports the varied needs of the patient communities we serve. We continue to grow our list of employee resource groups, adding two in 2024, and expand our sourcing for new talent to enhance our talent pipeline. We are also committed to equitable pay for all employees. We use industry benchmarks and annual internal equity reviews to make salary adjustments as needed in efforts to ensure a fair and bias-free compensation system. As we grow, we are continuing to implement initiatives to advance the development of our talent and ensure comprehensive succession plans both in our employee workforce and our board of directors. \nAs part of our effort to further the integration of our values across our business, in 2024, we hired a director of sustainability, with centralized responsibility for our Responsibility Report and sustainability efforts. This individual, together with members of our executive leadership, updates our Nominations and Governance Committee and Board of Directors on sustainability considerations and strategy. We are cognizant of our environmental impact, currently support several green measures and community service programs, and continue to explore options to improve and build upon our sustainability efforts. We are committed to ensuring the health and well-being of our employees and promoting patient advocacy and safety. Finally, we are driven by integrity and believe good corporate governance is important and necessary to maintain ethical and compliant business practices. In 2024, we published our second Responsibility Report.\nAvailable Information\nWe file electronically with the SEC our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).

      "text": "ITEM 1A.        RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects for growth, and the value of an investment in our common stock. In addition, these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (please read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). \nRisk Factor Summary\nAn investment in our securities is subject to various risks, the most significant of which are summarized below. \n•Our prospects are highly dependent on the success of our only approved product, ARIKAYCE. If we are unable to continue to successfully market and commercialize or maintain approval for ARIKAYCE, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock will be materially adversely affected.\n•We may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for brensocatib, TPIP, or for our other product candidates and we may not be able to receive approval for ARIKAYCE in front-line NTM lung disease or in new markets. Any such failure to obtain regulatory approvals, particularly for brensocatib in the US, may materially adversely affect us.\n•The commercial success of ARIKAYCE depends on continued market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the healthcare community, and the commercial success of brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates, if approved, will similarly depend on such market acceptance.\n•We obtained regulatory approval of ARIKAYCE in the US through an accelerated approval process, and full approval will be contingent on successful and timely completion of a confirmatory post-marketing clinical trial. \n•We remain subject to substantial, ongoing regulatory requirements related to ARIKAYCE, and failure to comply with these requirements could lead to enforcement action or otherwise materially harm our business.\n•If we are unable to obtain or maintain adequate reimbursement from government or third-party payors for ARIKAYCE or, if approved, brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates, or if we are unable to obtain or maintain acceptable prices for ARIKAYCE, or, if approved, brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates, our prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability will be materially adversely affected.\n•ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates could develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n•If estimates of the size of the potential markets for ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates are overstated or data we have used to identify physicians is inaccurate, our ability to earn revenue to support our business could be materially adversely affected.\n•We may not be successful in clinical trials or in obtaining regulatory approvals required to expand the indications for ARIKAYCE, which may materially adversely affect our prospects and the value of our common stock.\n•Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain, and we may not succeed in developing product candidates in the future.\n•Interim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available, may be interpreted differently if additional data are disclosed, and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. \n•Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of our product devices, including Lamira, as a delivery system for ARIKAYCE, and the dry powder delivery system for TPIP, could materially harm our business.\n•If our clinical studies do not produce positive results or our clinical trials are delayed, or if serious side effects are identified during drug development, we may experience delays, incur additional costs and ultimately be unable to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates in the US, Europe, Japan or other markets.\n•We may not be able to enroll enough patients to conduct and complete our clinical trials or retain a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to generate the data necessary for regulatory approval of our product candidates or to permit the use of ARIKAYCE in the broader population of patients with MAC lung disease.\n•If another party obtains orphan drug exclusivity for a product that is considered the same or essentially the same as a product we are developing for a particular indication, we may be precluded or delayed from commercializing the product in that indication.\n•Our pre-clinical research activities include the research and development of novel gene therapy product candidates. It will be difficult to predict the time and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval for any such product candidates, or how long it will take to commercialize any gene therapy product candidates.\n•If we are unable to form and sustain relationships with third-party service providers that are critical to our business, or if any third-party arrangements that we may enter into are unsuccessful, our ability to develop and commercialize our products may be materially adversely affected.\n•We may not have, or may be unable to obtain, sufficient quantities of ARIKAYCE, Lamira or our product candidates to meet our required supply for commercialization or clinical studies, which would materially harm our business.\n•Adverse consequences to our business could result if we and our manufacturing partners fail to comply with applicable regulations or maintain required approvals.\n•We are dependent upon retaining and attracting key personnel, the loss of whose services could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\n•We expect to continue to expand our development, regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\n•Any acquisitions we make, or collaborative relationships we enter into, may not be clinically or commercially successful, and may require financing or a significant amount of cash, which could adversely affect our business.\n•Our business and operations, including our drug development and commercialization programs, could be materially disrupted and/or subject to reputational harm in the event of system failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, deficiencies in our cybersecurity, violations of data protection laws or data loss or damage by us or third parties.\n•We are subject to data privacy laws and regulations that govern how we can collect, process, store and transfer personal data, and violations can result in meaningful penalties, enforcement, and/or reputational harm and have a significant impact on our operations.\n•We have limited experience operating internationally, are subject to a number of risks associated with our international activities and operations and may not be successful in any efforts to further expand internationally.\n•We have a limited number of significant customers and losing any of them could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n•Deterioration in general economic conditions in the US, Europe, Japan and globally, including the effect of prolonged periods of inflation on our suppliers, third-party service providers and potential partners, could harm our business and results of operations.\n•If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, the value of ARIKAYCE and our product candidates could be materially diminished.\n•If we fail to comply with obligations in our third-party agreements, our business could be adversely affected, including as a result of the loss of license rights that are important to our business.\n•Government healthcare reform could materially increase our costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\n•If we fail to comply with applicable laws, including \"fraud and abuse\" laws, anti-corruption laws and trade control laws, we could be subject to negative publicity, civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\n•We have a history of operating losses, expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n•We may need to raise additional funds to continue our operations, and any failure to obtain capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development programs, commercialization efforts, or other operations.\n•We have outstanding indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes, a term loan and a royalty financing arrangement and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our financial position, prevent us from implementing our strategy, and dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.\n•We may be unable to use certain of our net operating losses and other tax assets.\n•Goodwill impairment charges in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n•Our shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock for general corporate purposes and upon the conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes.\n•Certain provisions of Virginia law, our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and arrangements between us and our employees could hamper a third party’s acquisition of us or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization and Continued Approval of ARIKAYCE, and the Potential Approval and Commercialization of Brensocatib and TPIP\nOur prospects are highly dependent on the continued success of our only approved product, ARIKAYCE, which was approved in the United States as ARIKAYCE (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension), in Europe as ARIKAYCE Liposomal 590 mg Nebuliser Dispersion and in Japan as ARIKAYCE inhalation 590mg (amikacin sulfate inhalation drug product). If we are unable to continue to successfully market and commercialize or maintain approval for ARIKAYCE, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock will be materially adversely affected.\nOur long-term viability and growth depend on the continued successful commercialization of ARIKAYCE, our only approved product. ARIKAYCE was approved in the US for the treatment of MAC lung disease as part of a combination \nantibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options in a refractory setting, as defined by patients who do not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum of six consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy. Subsequently, ARIKAYCE was approved in Europe for the treatment of NTM lung infections caused by MAC in adults with limited treatment options who do not have CF, and in Japan for the treatment of patients with NTM lung disease caused by MAC who did not sufficiently respond to prior treatments with a multidrug regimen. We refer to NTM lung disease caused by MAC as MAC lung disease. We have invested and continue to invest significant efforts and financial resources in the commercialization of ARIKAYCE, and our ability to continue to generate revenue from ARIKAYCE will depend heavily on successfully commercializing and obtaining full regulatory approval for ARIKAYCE from the FDA by conducting an appropriate confirmatory post-marketing study. ARIKAYCE was our first commercial launch, and its continued successful commercialization and our receipt of full regulatory approval for ARIKAYCE in the US are subject to many risks.\nIn order to continue to commercialize ARIKAYCE, we must continue to establish and maintain marketing, market access, sales and distribution capabilities on our own or make arrangements with third parties for its marketing, sale and distribution. We are commercializing ARIKAYCE in the US, Europe and Japan using our sales force, but we may not continue to be successful in these efforts. The establishment, development and maintenance of our own sales force is and will continue to be expensive and time-consuming. As a result, we may seek one or more partners to handle some or all of the sales and marketing of ARIKAYCE in certain markets following approval by the relevant regulatory authority in those markets. In that case, we will be reliant on third parties to successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE and will have less control over commercialization efforts than if we handled commercialization with our own sales force. However, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell ARIKAYCE on favorable terms or at all. In the event that either our own marketing, market access, sales force or third-party marketing, and sales organizations are not effective, our ability to generate revenue would be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for brensocatib, or for our other product candidates and we may not be able to receive approval for ARIKAYCE in front-line NTM lung disease or in new markets. Any such failure to obtain regulatory approvals, particularly for brensocatib, may materially adversely affect us.\nWe are required to obtain various regulatory approvals prior to studying our products in humans and then again before we market and distribute our products, and the failure to obtain such approvals will prevent us from commercializing our products, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock. While we have obtained accelerated approval for ARIKAYCE in the US and approval in the EU and Japan, seeking regulatory approvals for brensocatib and any future regulatory approvals for our other product candidates as well as approval for ARIKAYCE in front-line NTM lung disease or in other jurisdictions presents significant obstacles. Approval processes in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets require the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data, manufacturing and quality information regarding the process and facility, scientific data characterizing our product and other supporting data in order to establish safety and effectiveness. These processes are complex, lengthy, expensive, resource intensive and uncertain. Regulators will also conduct a rigorous review of any trade name we intend to use for our products. Even after they approve a trade name, these regulators may request that we adopt an alternative name for the product if adverse event reports indicate a potential for confusion with other trade names and medication error. If we are required to adopt an alternative name, potential commercialization of brensocatib or our other product candidates could be delayed or continued commercialization of ARIKAYCE could be delayed or interrupted. We have limited experience in submitting and pursuing applications necessary to obtain these regulatory approvals. \nData submitted to regulators are subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory agency approval. Even if we believe our clinical trial results are promising, regulators may disagree with our interpretation of data, study design or execution and may refuse to accept our application for review or decline to grant approval. \nIn addition, the grant of a designation by the FDA or EMA or approval by the FDA, EC or MHLW does not ensure a similar decision by the regulatory authorities of other countries, and a decision by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or the FDA will agree with the decision. For instance, although ARIKAYCE received orphan drug designation in the US, ARIKAYCE did not qualify for orphan drug designation in Japan due to the estimated number of NTM patients in Japan exceeding 50,000. Similarly, clinical studies conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, and administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in these other territories might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. We may never obtain approval for brensocatib or for our other product candidates in the US or other jurisdictions, or for ARIKAYCE outside of the US, Europe and Japan, which would limit our market opportunities and materially adversely affect our business. Even if brensocatib or another product candidate is approved, or if ARIKAYCE is approved outside of the US, Europe and Japan, regulators may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming additional clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval.\nWe may also encounter delays or rejections based on changes in regulatory agency policies during the period in which we develop a product and the period required for review of any application for regulatory agency approval of a particular \nproduct. Resolving such delays could force us or third parties to incur significant costs, limit our allowed activities or the allowed activities of third parties, diminish any competitive advantages that we or our third parties may attain or adversely affect our ability to receive royalties, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nThe commercial success of ARIKAYCE depends on continued market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the healthcare community and the commercial success of brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates, if approved, will similarly depend on market acceptance.\nDespite receiving FDA, EC and Japan's MHLW approval of ARIKAYCE, market acceptance may vary among physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the healthcare community. ARIKAYCE was the first product approved in the US via the LPAD pathway, and its approval under this pathway may impact market acceptance of the product. The degree of market acceptance of ARIKAYCE, which we launched in the US early in the fourth quarter of 2018, in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2020, and in Japan in the second quarter of 2021, is also dependent on a number of additional factors, including the following:\n•The willingness of the target patient populations to use, and of physicians to prescribe, ARIKAYCE;\n•The efficacy and potential advantages of ARIKAYCE over alternative treatments;\n•The risk and safety profile of ARIKAYCE, including, among other things, physician and patient concern regarding the US boxed warning and other safety precautions resulting from its association with an increased risk of respiratory adverse reactions, and any adverse safety information that becomes available as a result of longer-term use of ARIKAYCE;\n•Relative convenience and ease of administration, including any requirements for hospital administration of ARIKAYCE;\n•The ability of the patient to tolerate ARIKAYCE;\n•The pricing of ARIKAYCE;\n•The ability and willingness of the patient to pay out of pocket costs for ARIKAYCE (for example co-payments);\n•Sufficient third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement; \n•The strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products and treatments; and\n•Publicity concerning ARIKAYCE or any potential competitive products and treatments.\nOur efforts to educate physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the healthcare community on the benefits of ARIKAYCE have required and will continue to require significant resources, which may be greater than those required to commercialize more established technologies and these efforts may never be successful. If approved, the market acceptance of brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates may vary among physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the healthcare community and will depend on substantially similar factors. \nWe obtained regulatory approval of ARIKAYCE in the US through an accelerated approval process, and full approval will be contingent on successful and timely completion of a confirmatory post-marketing clinical trial. Failure to obtain full approval or otherwise meet our post-marketing requirements and commitments would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FDA approved ARIKAYCE under the LPAD and accelerated approval pathways, and full approval will be based on results from a post-marketing confirmatory clinical trial. Accelerated approval allows drugs that (i) are being developed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and (ii) provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments to be approved substantially based on an intermediate endpoint or a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, rather than a clinical endpoint such as survival or irreversible morbidity. Accelerated approval of ARIKAYCE was supported by preliminary data from the Phase 3 CONVERT study, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of ARIKAYCE in adult patients with refractory MAC lung disease, using achievement of sputum culture conversion (defined as three consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures) by Month 6 as the primary endpoint. \nAs a condition of accelerated approval, we must conduct a post-marketing confirmatory clinical trial. Additionally, we are required to submit periodic reports on the progress of this clinical trial. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we commenced the post-marketing confirmatory clinical trial program for ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease. The confirmatory clinical trial program consists of the ARISE trial, an interventional study designed to validate cross-sectional and longitudinal characteristics of a PRO tool in MAC lung disease, and the ENCORE trial, designed to establish the clinical benefits and evaluate the safety of ARIKAYCE in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent MAC lung disease using the PRO tool validated in the ARISE trial. The confirmatory clinical program is intended to fulfill the FDA’s post-marketing requirement to allow for full approval of ARIKAYCE by the FDA, and verification and description of clinical benefit in the ENCORE trial will be necessary for full approval of ARIKAYCE. The trial completion timetable agreed upon with the FDA when the \napproval letter for ARIKAYCE was received has been delayed. We remain engaged with the FDA regarding the timeline, status and execution of the post-marketing confirmatory clinical trials. There is little precedent for clinical development and regulatory expectations for agents to treat MAC lung disease. In September 2023, we announced positive topline results from the ARISE trial. The study met its primary objective of demonstrating that the QOL-B respiratory domain works effectively as a PRO tool in patients with MAC lung disease. Based on feedback and in alignment with the FDA, we have determined that the primary endpoint for the ENCORE trial will include eight questions from the QOL-B respiratory domain PRO. We completed enrollment of the ENCORE trial in the fourth quarter of 2024, with 425 patients enrolled. However, we may encounter substantial delays in conducting the ENCORE trial, and we may not be able to conduct the trial in a manner satisfactory to the FDA or within the time period required by the FDA. The FDA could, among other things, withdraw its approval of ARIKAYCE using expedited procedures if the ENCORE trial is not successful or if the FDA concludes that we failed to conduct the ENCORE trial with due diligence, that other evidence demonstrates that ARIKAYCE is not shown to be safe and effective, or that we disseminated false or misleading promotional materials with respect to ARIKAYCE. Additionally, under the amendments to the FDCA made by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, the FDA could pursue administrative and judicial remedies for a violation of the FDCA if we were to fail to conduct the ENCORE trial with due diligence or not timely submit the required reports on the progress of the ENCORE trial. Separate from the confirmatory trial, additional results from ongoing and recently completed studies may affect the FDA’s benefit-risk analysis for the product. Failure to meet all post-marketing commitments may raise additional regulatory challenges.\nWe remain subject to substantial, ongoing regulatory requirements, and failure to comply with these requirements could lead to enforcement action or otherwise materially harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, advertising, promotion, and record-keeping requirements in the US, Europe, and Japan including requirements to:\n•Conduct sales, marketing and promotion, scientific exchange, speaker programs, charitable donations and educational grant programs in compliance with federal and state laws; \n•Disclose clinical trial information and payments to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations on publicly available databases; \n•Monitor and report complaints, AEs and instances of failure to meet product specifications;\n•Comply with cGMP and quality systems requirements for devices;\n•Acquire licenses for marketing authorization and certifications for our third-party manufacturers when importing and selling pharmaceutical products manufactured in other countries into Japan;\n•Negotiate with national governments and other counterparties on pricing and reimbursement status;\n•Carry out post-approval confirmatory clinical trials;\n•Comply with ongoing pharmacovigilance requirements; and\n•Disclose payments to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations to national regulatory authorities and/or on publicly available websites. \nIf we ultimately receive approval for ARIKAYCE or any of our product candidates in jurisdictions other than the US, Europe, and Japan, we expect to be subject to similar ongoing regulatory oversight by the relevant foreign regulatory authorities, including the requirement to negotiate with national governments and other counterparties on pricing and reimbursement prices for each new jurisdiction.\nFailure to comply with these ongoing regulatory obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:\n•Issuance of warning letters or untitled letters by the FDA asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n•Imposition of injunctions or civil monetary penalties or pursuit by regulators of civil or criminal prosecutions and fines against us or our responsible officers;\n•Suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n•Suspension or termination of ongoing clinical trials or refusal by regulators to approve pending marketing applications or supplements to approved applications;\n•Seizure of products, required product recalls or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, or to import or export products;\n•Enforcement actions, such as a product recalls, or product shortages due to failure to meet certain manufacturing or regulatory requirements, including the successful completion and results of quality control or release testing;\n•Suspension of, or imposition of restrictions on, our operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements with respect to ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP, INS1201, or any of our other product candidates; and\n•Negative publicity, including communications issued by regulatory authorities, which could negatively impact the perception of us or ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP, INS1201, or any of our other product candidates by patients, physicians, third-party payors or the healthcare community.\nWe provide financial assistance with out-of-pocket costs to patients enrolled in commercial health insurance plans. In addition, independent foundations may assist with out-of-pocket financial obligations. The ability of these organizations to provide assistance to patients is dependent on funding from external sources, and we cannot guarantee that such funding will be available at adequate levels, if at all. Patient assistance programs, whether provided directly by manufacturers or charitable foundations, have come under recent government scrutiny. If we are deemed to fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance with respect to these programs, we could be subject to significant fines or penalties.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from government or third-party payors for ARIKAYCE or, if approved, brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates, or if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices for ARIKAYCE, or, if approved, brensocatib or TPIP, our prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability will be materially adversely affected.\nOur prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability depend heavily upon the availability of adequate reimbursement for the use of ARIKAYCE or, if approved, brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates from governmental and other third-party payors, both in the US and in other markets. A portion of our current ARIKAYCE revenue in the US comes from Medicare reimbursement, and we expect that trend to continue. Reimbursement by a third-party payor depends upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is:\n•A covered benefit under its health plan;\n•Safe, effective and medically necessary;\n•Appropriate for the specific patient;\n•Cost-effective; and\n•Neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining a determination of coverage and reimbursement for a product from each relevant governmental or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payor. Payors in the US have evaluated ARIKAYCE for inclusion on formularies. Going forward, we may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain positive coverage and reimbursement determinations or we might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of ARIKAYCE to such payors’ satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources.\nEven when a payor determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, the payor may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the FDA or non-US regulatory authorities and/or may set a reimbursement rate that is too low to support a profitable sales price for the product. For example, in France we agreed with the French authorities to a reimbursed price which was lower than the price in our temporary authorization for use (Autorisation Temporaire d'Utilisation or ATU) and are required to refund the difference. As a result, we recorded a revenue reversal in the fourth quarter of 2022, related to revenue recorded in prior periods. In addition, in 2023, we experienced a one-time, prospective price decrease for ARIKAYCE in Japan of 9.4%. In the US, payors have restricted and continue to restrict coverage of ARIKAYCE by using a variable co-payment structure that imposes higher costs on patients for drugs that are not preferred by the payor and by imposing requirements for prior authorization or step edits. Subsequent approvals of competitive products could result in a detrimental change to the reimbursement of our products. The occurrence of any of these events likely would adversely impact market acceptance and demand for ARIKAYCE, which, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock. \nThere is a significant focus in the US healthcare industry and elsewhere on drug prices and value, and public and private payors are taking increasingly aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by, among other things, negotiating manufacturer discounts and placing restrictions on reimbursement for, and patient access to, medications. These pressures could negatively affect our business. We expect changes in the Medicare program and state Medicaid programs, as well as managed care organizations and other third-party payors, to continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical product pricing. One significant example of recent legislative action is the IRA, which was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA gives the HHS the ability and authority to directly negotiate with manufacturers the price that Medicare will pay for certain high-priced drugs and set caps on the negotiated price of such drugs, among other changes. The IRA also requires manufacturers of certain Part B and Part D drugs to issue to HHS rebates based on certain calculations and triggers (i.e., when drug prices increase and outpace the rate of inflation), which may influence the pricing of current and future products. At this time, while we believe that ARIKAYCE will be excluded from negotiation due to its orphan drug designation, we cannot predict other potential implications the IRA provisions will have on our business or the pricing of brensocatib or TPIP, if approved, or any \nfuture products. These types of laws may have a significant impact on our ability to set a product price we believe is fair and may adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability. We expect further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms to continue to be proposed, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the products we develop or may otherwise limit our commercial opportunity. See Reimbursement of Pharmaceutical Products in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. In addition, in connection with various government programs, we are required to report certain pricing information to the government, and the failure to do so may subject us to penalties.\nIn markets outside the US, including countries in Europe, Japan and Canada, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. Evaluation criteria used by many government agencies in European countries for the purposes of pricing and reimbursement typically focus on a product’s degree of innovation and its ability to meet a clinical need unfulfilled by currently available therapies. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) created a similar entity, the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, designed to review the effectiveness of treatments and medications in federally-funded healthcare programs. An adverse result could lead to a treatment or product being removed from Medicare or Medicare coverage. The decisions of such governmental agencies could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nWe continue to have discussions with third-party payors regarding our price for ARIKAYCE, and our pricing may meet resistance from them and the public generally. If we are unable to maintain adequate reimbursement for ARIKAYCE in the US, Europe and Japan, the adoption of ARIKAYCE by physicians and patients may be limited. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable prices for ARIKAYCE, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability. Both of these risks, in turn, could affect our ability to successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates could develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, which would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nARIKAYCE is now being used by larger numbers of patients, for longer periods of time than during our clinical trials (including in the CONVERT study), and we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payors) are collecting extensive information on the efficacy and safety of ARIKAYCE by monitoring its use in the marketplace. In addition, we are conducting a confirmatory trial to assess and describe the clinical benefit of ARIKAYCE in patients with MAC lung disease. We may also conduct additional trials in connection with lifecycle management programs for ARIKAYCE and, if approved, brensocatib or TPIP. New safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and our clinical trials may result in negative consequences including the following:\n•Modification to product labeling or promotional statements, such as additional boxed or other warnings or contraindications, or the issuance of additional “Dear Doctor Letters” or similar communications to healthcare professionals;\n•Required changes in the administration of ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, or TPIP;\n•Imposition of additional post-marketing surveillance, post-marketing clinical trial requirements, distribution restrictions or other risk management measures, such as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) or a REMS with elements to assure safe use;\n•Suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n•Suspension or termination of ongoing clinical trials or refusal by regulators to approve pending marketing applications or supplements to approved applications;\n•Suspension of, or imposition of restrictions on, our operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements with respect to ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, or TPIP; and\n•Voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market and costly product liability claims.\nAny of these circumstances could reduce ARIKAYCE’s market acceptance or, if approved, the market acceptance of brensocatib or TPIP and would be likely to materially adversely affect our business.\nIf estimates of the size of the potential markets for ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates are overstated or data we have used to identify physicians is inaccurate, our ability to earn revenue to support our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have relied on external sources, including market research funded by us and third parties, and internal analyses and calculations to estimate the potential market opportunities for ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP, or any of our other product candidates. The externally sourced information used to develop these estimates has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable, but we have not verified the data from such sources, and their accuracy and completeness cannot be assured. With respect to ARIKAYCE, our internal analyses and calculations are based upon management’s understanding and assessment of numerous inputs and market conditions, including, but not limited to, the projected increase in prevalence of MAC lung disease, Medicare patient population growth and ongoing population shifts to geographies with increased rates of MAC lung disease. These understandings and assessments necessarily require assumptions subject to significant judgment and may prove to be \ninaccurate. As a result, our estimates of the size of these potential markets for ARIKAYCE could prove to be overstated, perhaps materially. \nIn addition, we are relying on third-party data to identify the physicians who treat the majority of MAC lung disease patients in the US and to determine how to deploy our resources to market to those physicians; however, we may not be marketing to the appropriate physicians and may therefore be limiting our market opportunity. \nWith regard to brensocatib, our estimated number of total diagnosed bronchiectasis patients in the US was derived from an external source. A similar per capita prevalence was used to calculate the estimated prevalence in the European 5. Our potential addressable market for TPIP in the US, the European 5 and Japan was also derived from external sources. However, studies indicate a lack of consensus on prevalence rates.\nIn the future, we may develop additional estimates with respect to market opportunities for our other product candidates, and such estimates are subject to similar risks. In addition, a potential market opportunity could be reduced if a regulator limits the proposed treatment population for one of our product candidates, similar to the limited population for which ARIKAYCE was approved. In either circumstance, even if we obtain regulatory approval, we may be unable to commercialize the product on a scale sufficient to generate significant revenue from such product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nWe may not be successful in clinical trials or in obtaining regulatory approvals required to expand the indication for ARIKAYCE, which may materially adversely affect our prospects and the value of our common stock.\nThe FDA granted accelerated approval of ARIKAYCE for the treatment of MAC lung disease as part of a combination antibacterial drug regimen for adult patients with limited or no alternative treatment options in a refractory setting, as defined by patients who do not achieve negative sputum culture after a minimum of six consecutive months of a multidrug background regimen therapy. Our CONVERT study and 312 study focused on this refractory population, and we do not anticipate obtaining an indication for a broader population of patients with MAC lung disease or any other illnesses or infections without additional clinical data. Additional clinical trials will require additional time and expense. While we reported positive topline results from our ARISE trial, we are continuing to conduct our confirmatory clinical trial program for full approval of ARIKAYCE in the broader population of patients with MAC lung disease through our ENCORE trial, but this trial program, along with any other clinical trials of ARIKAYCE, may not be successful. Additional results from ongoing and recently completed studies may affect the FDA’s benefit-risk analysis for the product. If we are unable to expand the indication for use of ARIKAYCE, our prospects and the value of our common stock may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates Generally\nPharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain, and we may not succeed in developing product candidates in the future.\nProduct development in the pharmaceutical industry is an expensive, high-risk, lengthy, complicated, resource intensive process. In order to develop a product successfully, we must, among other things:\n•Identify potential product candidates;\n•Submit for and receive regulatory approval to perform clinical trials;\n•Design and conduct appropriate preclinical and clinical trials, including confirmatory clinical trials, according to good laboratory practices and good clinical practices and disease-specific expectations of the FDA and other regulatory bodies;\n•Select and recruit clinical investigators and subjects for our clinical trials;\n•Obtain and correctly interpret data establishing adequate safety of our product candidates and demonstrating with statistical significance that our product candidates are effective for their proposed indications, as indicated by satisfaction of pre-established endpoints;\n•Submit for and receive regulatory approvals for marketing; and\n•Manufacture the product candidates and device constituent parts according to cGMP and other applicable standards and regulations.\nThere is a high rate of failure inherent in this process, and potential products that appear promising at early stages of development may fail for a number of reasons. Importantly, positive results from preclinical studies of a product candidate may not be predictive of similar results in human clinical trials, promising results from earlier clinical trials of a product candidate may not be replicated in later clinical trials, and observations from ongoing trials, including observations based on interim, preliminary, or blinded data, may not be representative of results after the trials are completed and all data is collected and analyzed. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving positive results in earlier stages of development and have abandoned development efforts or sought partnerships in order to continue development.\nIn addition, there are many other difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development that could significantly delay or otherwise materially impair our ability to develop future product candidates, including the following:\n•Conditions imposed by regulators, ethics committees or institutional review boards for preclinical testing and clinical trials relating to the scope or design of our clinical trials, including selection of endpoints and number of required patients or clinical sites; \n•Challenges in designing our clinical trials to support potential claims of superiority over current standard of care or future competitive therapies; \n•Restrictions placed upon, or other difficulties with respect to, clinical trials and clinical trial sites, including with respect to potential clinical holds or suspension or termination of clinical trials due to, among other things, potential safety or ethical concerns or noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n•Delayed or reduced enrollment in clinical trials, high discontinuation rates or overly concentrated patient enrollment in specific geographic regions;\n•Failure by third-party contractors, contract research organizations (CROs), clinical investigators, clinical laboratories, or suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner;\n•Greater than anticipated cost of our clinical trials; and\n•Insufficient product supply or inadequate product quality.\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our product candidates now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional products or product candidates; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful. Failure to successfully develop future product candidates for any of these reasons may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available, may be interpreted differently if additional data are disclosed, and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or topline data from our clinical trials, which may be based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data in a summary or topline format, and the results and related findings may change as more patient data become available, may be interpreted differently if additional data are disclosed at a later time and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. For example, in May 2024, we announced topline data for the ASPEN trial. If additional results from our clinical trials are not consistent with this topline data or other previously released data or are not viewed favorably, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize our approved drug and drug candidates, our business, operating results, prospects, or financial condition may be harmed and our stock price may decrease.\nWe also make assumptions, estimates, calculations, and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the preliminary or topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same trials, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been disclosed and/or are received and fully evaluated. Such data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, preliminary and topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. We may also disclose interim data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. In addition, blinded data may not be predictive of unblinded data.\nFurther, other parties, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions, or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular drug candidate or product, and our business in general. In addition, in regards to the information we publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial, such as topline data, you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in such disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose, or to disclose at a later date, such as at a medical meeting may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities, or otherwise regarding a particular drug, drug candidate, or our business. If the topline data that we report differ from actual results or are interpreted differently once additional data are disclosed at a later date, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize our drug candidates, our business, operating results, prospects, or financial condition may be harmed or our stock price may decline.\nWe will need to secure regulatory approval in each market for Lamira as a delivery system for ARIKAYCE. Any failures to secure separate regulatory approvals for Lamira as a delivery system will limit our ability to successfully commercialize ARIKAYCE. Additionally, we plan to submit an NDA for TPIP as a drug/device combination product or as a stand-alone marketing application, as dictated by local regulations, with Lamira as the dry powder delivery system for TPIP. Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of our devices or drug-device combination products could materially harm our business. \nLamira must receive separate regulatory approval or clearance in connection with each approved product or product candidate it will be used to administer. The FDA granted accelerated approval of Lamira with ARIKAYCE as part of the approval of the drug/device combination product, and Lamira is CE marked by PARI in Europe and authorized for use by MHLW in Japan. However, outside the US, Europe and Japan, Lamira is labeled as investigational for use in our clinical trials, including in Canada and Australia, and is not approved for commercial use in Canada or certain other markets in which we may seek to commercialize ARIKAYCE in the future.\nIn addition, we plan to submit a marketing application for TPIP as a drug/device combination product or as a stand-alone application, as dictated by local regulations, with Lamira as the dry powder delivery system for TPIP. We will need to seek additional approvals in connection with the delivery device for TPIP in certain markets before we can market and commercialize TPIP in them. \nWe will continue to work closely with PARI to coordinate efforts regarding regulatory requirements, including our proposed filings. If we and PARI are not successful in obtaining approval for each usage of Lamira in each market, our ability to commercialize ARIKAYCE in those markets would be materially impaired. In addition, failure to maintain regulatory approval or clearance of Lamira could result in increased development costs, withdrawal of regulatory approval, delays or other material harm our business. Finally, failure to obtain regulatory approval or clearance of the delivery device for TPIP would affect our ability to develop and commercialize TPIP.\nIf our clinical studies do not produce positive results or our clinical trials are delayed, or if serious side effects are identified during drug development, we may experience delays, incur additional costs and ultimately be unable to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize our product candidates in the US, Europe, Japan or other markets.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive preclinical tests to demonstrate the safety of our product candidates in animals, and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. If we experience delays in our clinical trials or other testing or the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive, including with respect to safety, we may:\n•Experience increased product development costs;\n•Be delayed in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates;\n•Obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or entirely different than those indications for which we sought approval or with labeling with boxed warnings or other warnings or contraindications;\n•Need to change the way the product is administered; \n•Be required to perform additional clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n•Have regulatory authorities withdraw, or suspend, their approval of the product or impose risk mitigation strategies such as restrictions on distribution or other REMS;\n•Face a shortened patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our products;\n•Have competitors that are able to bring similar products to market before us;\n•Be sued for alleged injuries caused to patients using our products; or\n•Suffer reputational damage.\nSuch circumstances would impair our ability to commercialize our products and harm our business and results of operations.\nThe risk of finding adverse side effects may be particularly heightened in the case of gene therapies. For instance, new gene copies may produce too much or too little of the desired protein or RNA, or the production of the desired protein or RNA may change over time. Because the treatment is irreversible, there may be challenges in managing side effects. Some adverse effects would not be able to be reversed or relieved and might require us to develop additional clinical safety procedures. Furthermore, new gene copies may disrupt other normal biological molecules and processes which could also result in undesirable adverse effects. Adverse side effects may also be experienced by patients as a result of the process for administering the therapy or related procedures. \nThere have been several significant adverse side effects in gene therapy treatments in the past, including reported cases of leukemia, immune-mediated responses, and death seen in other trials. Gene therapy is still a relatively new approach to disease treatment and additional adverse side effects could develop. For instance, possible adverse side effects that could occur include immunologic-mediated reactions early after administration, which could substantially limit the effectiveness of the treatment, and could lead to further adverse side effects, possibly including organ failure or death. Additional manufacturing, clinical, and preclinical testing may be required, as well as additional analyses, assessments, and potential long-term patient and clinical study subject monitoring, beyond what is currently required, and sample testing and associated regulatory reporting. Serious adverse events in our clinical trials, or other clinical trials involving gene therapy products or our competitors’ products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could further adversely impact our product candidates in the form of increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, the need for additional testing or monitoring, potential regulatory delays, stricter labeling requirements, and a decrease in demand.\nWe may not be able to enroll enough patients to conduct and complete our clinical trials or retain a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials to generate the data necessary for regulatory approval of our product candidates or to permit the use of ARIKAYCE in the broader population of patients with MAC lung disease.\nThe completion rate of our clinical trials is dependent on, among other factors, the patient enrollment rate. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including:\n•Investigator identification and recruitment;\n•Regulatory approvals to initiate study sites;\n•Patient population size;\n•The nature of the protocol to be used in the trial;\n•Patient proximity to clinical sites;\n•Eligibility criteria for the trial;\n•Patient willingness to participate in the trial;\n•Discontinuation rates; and\n•Competition from other companies’ potential clinical trials for the same patient population.\nDelays in patient enrollment for our clinical trials could increase costs and delay commercialization and sales, if any, of our products. Once enrolled, patients may elect to discontinue participation in a clinical trial at any time. If patients elect to discontinue participation in our clinical trials at a higher rate than expected, including with respect to our ENCORE trial, we may be unable to generate the data required by regulators for approval of our product candidates. \nIf another party obtains orphan drug exclusivity for a product that is considered the same or essentially the same as a product we are developing for a particular indication, we may be precluded or delayed from commercializing the product in that indication.\nUnder the ODA, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition. In the EU, the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating disease or condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. The company that obtains the first regulatory approval from the FDA for a designated orphan drug for an indication within the designated rare disease or condition generally receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for that indication for a period of seven years. Similar laws exist in the EU with a term of 10 years. See Business — Government Regulation — Orphan Drug Designation in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. If a competitor obtains approval of the same drug for the same indication before us, and the FDA grants such orphan drug exclusivity, we would be prohibited from obtaining approval for our product for seven years (or longer if the seven-year exclusivity period is extended for a QIDP or due to pediatric exclusivity), unless our product can be shown to be clinically superior. In addition, even if we obtain orphan exclusivity, the FDA may approve another product during our orphan exclusivity period for the same indication under certain circumstances.\nOur pre-clinical research activities include the research and development of novel gene therapy product candidates. It will be difficult to predict the time and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval for any such product candidates, or how long it will take to commercialize any gene therapy product candidates.\nWe intend to identify and develop novel gene therapy product candidates as part of our pre-clinical research efforts. We have limited experience in developing gene therapy programs and cannot be certain that any gene therapy product candidates that we develop will successfully complete preclinical studies and clinical trials, or that they will not cause significant adverse events or toxicities. Any such results could impact our ability to develop a product candidate, including our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials. Furthermore, there is the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to gene therapy products due to persistent biological activity of the genetic material or other components of products \nused to carry the genetic material, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for and commercialize any gene therapy products we may develop.\nIn addition, to date, only a small number of gene therapy products have been approved in the US, Europe or elsewhere, and regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. We may seek regulatory approval in territories outside the US and Europe, which may have their own regulatory authorities along with frequently changing requirements or guidelines. The regulatory review committees and advisory groups in the US, Europe and elsewhere, and any new guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) regulates gene therapy products. Within CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Therapeutic Products, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. CBER works closely with the National Institutes of Health (the NIH) in connection with the development of gene therapy. The FDA has published specific guidance documents with respect to the development and approval of gene therapy products. For example, in January 2020, the FDA issued final guidance documents that updated draft guidance documents that were originally released in July 2018 to reflect recent advances in the field, and to set forth the framework for the development, review and approval of gene therapies. Amongst these guidance documents are final guidance documents that pertain to the development of gene therapies for the treatment of specific disease categories, including rare diseases of interest to Insmed, and to manufacturing and long-term follow-up issues relevant to gene therapy, among other topics. The FDA also issued a final guidance document in September 2021 describing the FDA’s approach for determining whether two gene therapy products are the same or are different for the purpose of orphan-drug designation and orphan-drug exclusivity. The FDA has continued to issue additional draft and final guidance documents on the development and manufacture of gene therapy products. In addition, the FDA can put an IND for a gene therapy study on clinical hold for several reasons, including, but not limited to, if the information in an IND is not sufficient to assess the potential risks in study subjects. \nAs we advance gene therapy product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory authorities and advisory groups, and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of certain of our product candidates. These additional processes may result in a review and approval process that is longer than we otherwise would have expected. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate product revenue.\nDue to these factors, it is more difficult for us to predict the time and cost of gene therapy product candidate development, and we cannot predict whether the application of our approach to gene therapy, or any similar or competitive programs, will result in the identification, development and regulatory approval of any product candidates, or that the gene therapy programs of our competitors will not be considered better or more attractive or available in the market prior to ours. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to gene therapy product candidates will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. We may also experience delays and challenges in achieving sustainable, reproducible and scalable production. Additionally, if a safety concern arises in connection with a gene therapy product from any sponsor, regulatory authorities might apply greater scrutiny to our gene therapy product candidates and any approved gene therapy products, and it might become more challenging to enroll patients in clinical trials and commercialize approved gene therapy products. Any of these factors may prevent us from completing our pre-clinical studies or clinical trials or commercializing any gene therapy product candidates we may develop on a timely or profitable basis, if at all.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties including collaborators, CROs, clinical and analytical laboratories, CMOs and other providers for many services that are critical to our business. If we are unable to form and sustain these relationships, or if any third-party arrangements that we may enter into are unsuccessful, including due to non-compliance by such third parties with our agreements or applicable law, our ability to develop and commercialize our products may be materially adversely affected. \nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for significant research, analytical services, pre-clinical development, clinical development and manufacturing of our product candidates and commercial scale manufacturing of ARIKAYCE and Lamira. For example, we do not own facilities for clinical-scale or commercial manufacturing of our product candidates, and we expect that our future supply requirements for brensocatib and TPIP will be manufactured by CMOs. We currently rely on Resilience and Patheon to provide our clinical and commercial supply of ARIKAYCE. We currently primarily rely on Esteve and Thermo Fisher to provide our clinical supply for brensocatib. Additionally, almost all of our clinical trial work is done by CROs, such as PPD, our CRO for the ENCORE, BiRCh, and TPIP trials, and clinical laboratories. In addition, we rely on third parties to manufacture clinical materials for our pre-clinical research programs. Reliance on these third parties poses a number of risks, including the following:\n•The diversion of management time and cost of third-party advisers associated with the negotiation, documentation and implementation of agreements with third parties in the pharmaceutical industry;\n•The inability to control whether third parties devote sufficient resources to our programs or products, including with respect to meeting contractual deadlines;\n•The inability to control the regulatory and contractual compliance of third parties, including their quality systems, processes and procedures, systems utilized to collect and analyze data, and equipment used to test drug product and/or clinical supplies;\n•The inability to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements on favorable terms;\n•Disputes with third parties, including CROs, leading to loss of intellectual property rights, delay or termination of research, development, or commercialization of product candidates or litigation or arbitration; \n•Contracts with our collaborators fail to provide sufficient protection of our intellectual property; and\n•Difficulty enforcing our contractual rights if one of these third parties fails to perform.\nWe also rely on third parties to select and enter into agreements with clinical investigators to conduct clinical trials to support approval of our product candidates, and the failure of these third parties to appropriately carry out such evaluation and selection can adversely affect the quality of the data from these studies and, potentially, the approval of our products. In particular, as part of future drug approval submissions to the FDA, we must disclose certain financial interests of investigators who participated in any of the clinical studies being submitted in support of approval, or must certify to the absence of such financial interests. The FDA evaluates the information contained in such disclosures to determine whether disclosed interests may have an impact on the reliability of a study. If the FDA determines that financial interests of any clinical investigator raise serious questions of data integrity, the FDA can institute a data audit, request that we submit further data analyses, conduct additional independent studies to confirm the results of the questioned study, or refuse to use the data from the questioned study as a basis for approval. A finding by the FDA that a financial relationship of an investigator raises serious questions of data integrity could delay or otherwise adversely affect approval of our products.\nIn January 2024, the US House of Representatives introduced the BIOSECURE Act (H.R. 7085) and the Senate advanced a substantially similar bill (S.3558), which legislation, if passed and enacted into law, would potentially restrict our ability to utilize certain products and services from, or otherwise collaborate with, any \"biotechnology company of concern,” in the performance of a government contract or subcontract. Although the House version of the bill passed on September 9, 2024, the legislation ultimately did not pass before the end of the last session of Congress. It is possible that the BIOSECURE Act could be raised again in some form in this new and current session of Congress, either as a standalone bill or as part of broader legislation, and focus on these issues is expected to continue. We do business with companies in China and it is possible some of our contractual counterparties could be impacted by this legislation. \nThese risks could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock. \nWe may not have, or may be unable to obtain, sufficient quantities of ARIKAYCE, Lamira or our product candidates to meet our required supply for commercialization or clinical studies, which would materially harm our business.\nWe do not have any in-house manufacturing capability other than for small-scale preclinical development programs and depend completely on a small number of third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the manufacture of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. For instance, we are and expect to remain dependent upon Resilience and Patheon to supply ARIKAYCE both for our clinical trials and commercial sale. Resilience manufactures placebo for our clinical trials and our current supply of ARIKAYCE for commercial sale. However, we may not be able to maintain adequate quantities to meet future demand, including as a result of manufacturing and/or quality issues experienced by our third-party manufacturers or higher customer demand than expected. If we encounter delays or difficulties in the manufacturing process that disrupt our ability to supply our distributors and others with ARIKAYCE or our product candidates, we may experience product stock-outs, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. \nIn addition, we have entered into certain agreements with Patheon related to increasing our long-term production capacity for ARIKAYCE commercial inventory, although Patheon’s supply obligations will commence only after certain technology transfer and construction services are completed. Any delay in the commencement of Patheon’s supply obligations, whether due to delays in technology transfer and construction or from adding Patheon to our NDA as a CMO, would increase the risks associated with Resilience being unable to provide us with an adequate supply of ARIKAYCE. \nWe are also dependent upon PARI being able to provide an adequate supply of nebulizers for commercial sale of ARIKAYCE, any ongoing clinical trials, and future commercial sales of our product candidates that use Lamira as their delivery mechanism, as PARI is the sole manufacturer of Lamira. We have no alternative supplier for the nebulizer, and because significant effort and time were expended in the optimization of the nebulizer for use with ARIKAYCE, we do not intend to seek an alternative or secondary supplier. In the event PARI cannot provide us with sufficient quantities of the \nnebulizer, replication of the optimized device by another party would likely require considerable time and additional regulatory approval. In the case of certain specified supply failures, we have the right under our commercialization agreement with PARI to make the nebulizer and have it made by certain third parties, but not those deemed under the commercialization agreement to compete with PARI.\nWe will be reliant on CMOs to manufacture supply of brensocatib and TPIP for our future requirements. Esteve manufactures the active pharmaceutical ingredient for brensocatib and Patheon manufactures our current supply of brensocatib. We plan to enter into commercial agreements with CMOs for TPIP, and cannot guarantee that we will be able to locate adequate partners or enter into favorable agreements with them.\nWe are in the process of developing in-house clinical manufacturing capability for our gene therapy product candidates, but we expect to rely on third-party CMOs for manufacturing of all testing materials for the foreseeable future. Products intended for use in gene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. As we shift towards in-house clinical manufacturing capability for our gene therapy product candidates, we may encounter delays in obtaining regulatory approval of our manufacturing processes or in complying with ongoing manufacturing regulatory requirements and applicable cGMP, including challenges related to producing adequate quantities of clinical grade materials that meet FDA, EMA, MHLW or other applicable standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs.\nWe do not have long-term commercial agreements with all of our suppliers and if any of our suppliers are unable or unwilling to perform for any reason, we may not be able to locate suppliers or enter into favorable agreements with them. \nAn inadequate supply of ARIKAYCE, Lamira, brensocatib, TPIP, or our other product candidates would likely harm our commercial efforts or delay or impair clinical trials of ARIKAYCE or our product candidates and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock. \nThe manufacturing facilities of our third-party manufacturers are subject to significant government regulations and approvals, which are often costly and could result in adverse consequences to our business if we and our manufacturing partners fail to comply with the regulations or maintain the approvals.\nManufacturers of ARIKAYCE, Lamira and our product candidates are subject to cGMP, Quality System Regulations and similar standards. While we have policies and procedures in place to select third-party manufacturers for our product and product candidates that adhere, and monitor their adherence to, such standards, they may nonetheless fail to do so. Similarly, while we have entered into a Commercialization Agreement with PARI for the manufacture of Lamira for use with ARIKAYCE, PARI and its affiliates involved in manufacturing may fail to adhere to applicable standards. These manufacturers and their facilities will be subject to periodic review and inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities following regulatory approval of our products, as with ARIKAYCE. For instance, to monitor compliance with applicable regulations, the FDA routinely conducts inspections of facilities and may identify potential deficiencies. The FDA issues what are referred to as “Form 483s” that set forth observations and concerns identified during its inspections. Failure to satisfactorily address the concerns or potential deficiencies identified in a Form 483 could result in the issuance of a warning letter, which is a notice of the issues that the FDA believes to be significant regulatory violations requiring prompt corrective actions. Failure to respond adequately to a warning letter, or to otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement, remedial and/or punitive actions by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nIf one of these manufacturers fails to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or experiences supply problems, including in the scale-up of commercial production, the production of ARIKAYCE, Lamira, brensocatib and our other product candidates could be interrupted, resulting in delays, additional costs or restrictions on the marketing or sale of our products. An alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified, through regulatory filings, which could result in further delay. The regulatory authorities may also require additional testing if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. In addition, with respect to our product candidates, our manufacturers and their facilities are subject to pre-approval cGMP inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and the findings of the cGMP inspection could result in a failure to obtain, or a delay in obtaining, regulatory approval for future product candidates.\nRisks Related to the Operation of our Business\nWe are dependent upon retaining and attracting key personnel, the loss of whose services could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nWe depend heavily on our management team and our principal clinical and commercial personnel, the loss of whose services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research, development or commercialization objectives. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, clinical and commercial personnel, including those who join us through our business development activities. Our inability to retain and attract personnel could also negatively impact our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with commercial partners, leading research institutions and key distributors. \nCompetition for skilled personnel in our industry and market is intense because of the numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that seek similar personnel. These companies may have greater financial and other resources, offer a greater opportunity for career advancement and have a longer history in the industry than we do. We also experience competition for the hiring of our clinical and commercial personnel from universities, research institutions, and other third parties. We cannot assure that we will attract and retain such people or maintain such relationships. Our inability to retain and attract qualified employees would materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nWe expect to continue to expand our development, regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nIn connection with our commercialization of ARIKAYCE in the US, Europe and Japan, our continued international expansion efforts, and our ongoing development and planned commercialization of brensocatib, TPIP, INS1201, and other product candidates, we expect to continue to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs, quality, commercial compliance, medical affairs, and sales and marketing. For example, we plan to continue to hire additional personnel to support ARIKAYCE, the continued development and anticipated commercialization of brensocatib and the advancement of our other pipeline programs. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel, all while continuing to maintain our culture. Due to the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with this anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nAny acquisitions we make, or collaborative relationships we enter into, may not be clinically or commercially successful, and may require financing or a significant amount of cash, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may effect acquisitions to obtain additional businesses, products, technologies, capabilities and personnel. For example, we acquired Motus and AlgaeneX in August 2021 (the Business Acquisition), Vertuis in January 2023, and Adrestia in June 2023, each a privately-held, pre-clinical stage company. Acquisitions involve a number of operational risks, including:\n•Failure to achieve expected synergies;\n•The possibility that our acquired technologies, products and product candidates may not be commercially successful;\n•Difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of any acquired business;\n•The inability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of any acquired business;\n•The inability to maintain any acquired company’s relationship with key third parties, such as alliance partners;\n•Exposure to legal claims or other liabilities for activities of any acquired business prior to acquisition;\n•Diversion of our management’s attention from our core business; and\n•Potential impairment of intangible assets, adversely affecting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also may enter into collaborative relationships that would involve our collaborators conducting proprietary development programs. Disagreements with collaborators may develop over the rights to our intellectual property, and any conflict with our collaborators could limit our ability to obtain future collaboration agreements and negatively influence our relationship with existing collaborators. \nIf we make one or more significant acquisitions or enter into a significant collaboration in which the consideration includes cash, we may be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash and/or need to raise additional capital, which could adversely affect our financial condition. \nWe may be subject to product liability claims, and we have only limited product liability insurance.\nThe manufacture and sale of human therapeutic products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims, particularly as we continue to commercialize ARIKAYCE in the US, Europe and Japan, and look to commercialize brensocatib, if approved. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n•Decreased demand for ARIKAYCE and any other products that we may commercialize, and a corresponding loss of revenue;\n•Substantial monetary awards to patients or trial participants;\n•Significant time and costs to defend the related litigation;\n•Withdrawal or reduced enrollment of clinical trial participants; and\n•Reputational harm and significant negative media attention.\nWe have limited product liability insurance for our products. We do not know if we will be able to maintain existing, or obtain additional, product liability insurance on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. This type of insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we may be unable to commercialize our products. A successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, may require us to pay substantial amounts and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nOur business and operations, including our drug development and commercialization programs, could be materially disrupted and/or subject to reputational harm in the event of system failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, deficiencies in cybersecurity, violations of data protection laws or data loss or damage by us or third parties.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information, including protected health information, of clinical trial participants, patients and employees. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs, CMOs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, including a material disruption of our drug development and commercialization programs. \nIt is critical that we maintain such confidential information in a manner that preserves its confidentiality and integrity. Unauthorized disclosure of or access to sensitive or confidential patient or employee data, including personally identifiable information, whether through breach of computer systems, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or otherwise, or whether by our employees or third parties, could result in negative publicity, legal liability and damage to our reputation. Unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could also expose us to sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world. In addition, the loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory submission and approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data, if possible. To the extent that any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. For example, the loss of or damage to clinical trial data, such as from completed or ongoing clinical trials, for any of our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our drug candidates or any future drug candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their systems and operations could also have a material adverse effect on our business and lead to regulatory agency actions. \nWe have previously been, and expect to remain, the target of cyber-attacks. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, and we may not be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, or hostile foreign governments or agencies. Notifications and follow-up actions related to a security incident could impact our reputation or cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal and remediation costs, in connection with these measures and otherwise in connection with any actual or suspected security breach. Although we have general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions and potential cyber security breaches, our insurance may not cover all claims, continue to be available on reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount to cover one or more large claims; additionally, the insurer may disclaim coverage as to any claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nWe are subject to data privacy laws and regulations that govern how we can collect, process, store, and transfer personal data, and violations can result in meaningful penalties, enforcement, and/or reputational harm and have a significant impact on our operations.\nLaws and regulations governing personal data continue to develop at a rapid pace, and jurisdictions around the world continue to propose new legislation and rules. For example, a number of US states have passed consumer privacy laws or consumer health data laws. Other jurisdictions outside of the US either have data protection laws in place or continue to advance proposals for similar legislation and regulation. These laws place restrictions on how we collect, use, and transfer personal data, and they result in increased compliance and operational costs. Noncompliance with data protection laws and \nregulations can result in meaningful penalties, enforcement, and/or reputational harm and have a significant impact on our operations.\nOur inability to access, upgrade or expand our technology systems or difficulties in updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe have and will continue to expand, upgrade and develop our information technology capabilities, including our enterprise resource planning system, which was implemented through Oracle software in 2022, and a new enterprise-wide human capital management system, Workday, implemented in 2024. If we are unable to successfully continue upgrading or expanding our technological capabilities to support our growth or if there are deficiencies in the design or implementation of such capabilities, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, manage our costs effectively, manage our inventory, maintain a secure data environment, file timely reports with the SEC, or otherwise efficiently manage our internal controls. In addition, costs, potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology, or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems, could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Moreover, many of our vendors provide their services to us via a cloud-based model instead of software that is installed on our premises. As a result, we depend upon our vendors to provide us with services that are always available and are free of errors or defects that could cause disruptions in our business processes. Any failure by such vendors to do so, or any disruption in our ability to access the Internet, could materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our operations.\nWe have limited experience operating internationally, are subject to a number of risks associated with our international activities and operations and may not be successful in our efforts to expand internationally.\nWe currently have limited operations outside of the US. As of December 31, 2024, we had 153 employees located in Europe and 111 employees located in Japan, although we have clinical trial sites and suppliers located around the world. In order to meet our long-term goals, we expect to grow our international operations over the next several years, including in Europe and Japan, and continue to source material used in the manufacture of our product candidates from abroad. Additionally, a substantial portion of our commercial supply of ARIKAYCE is currently manufactured in Canada and, if approved, we expect that commercial supply of brensocatib will also be manufactured in Canada. Consequently, we are and will continue to be subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries, including:\n•Limited experience with international regulatory requirements;\n•An inability to achieve optimal pricing and reimbursement for ARIKAYCE, if approved in another jurisdiction, or subsequent changes in reimbursement, pricing and other regulatory requirements;\n•Any implementation of, or changes to, tariffs, trade barriers and other import-export regulations in the US or other countries in which we, or our third-party partners, operate;\n•Unexpected AEs related to ARIKAYCE or our product candidates occurring in foreign markets that we have not experienced in the US, Europe or Japan;\n•Scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders related to environmental, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions, human rights and other concerns in the countries in which we, or our third-party partners, operate;\n•Economic and political conditions, including foreign currency fluctuations and inflation, could result in reduced revenue, increased or unpredictable operating expenses and other obligations incident to doing business in, or with a company located in, another country;\n•Geopolitical events, such as conflicts, war and terrorism, could cause disruptions in our international operations, including planned or ongoing clinical studies; and\n•Compliance with foreign or US laws, rules and regulations, including data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import, export and trade restrictions, anti-bribery/anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules, which could lead to actions by us or our distributors, manufacturers, other third parties who act on our behalf or with whom we do business in foreign countries or our employees who are working abroad that could subject us to investigation or prosecution under such foreign or US laws.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and changing environment, and if we are unable to adapt to our environment, we may be unable to compete successfully.\nBiotechnology and related pharmaceutical technology have undergone and are likely to continue to experience rapid and significant change. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to these technologies and to obtain and maintain protection for our intellectual property. Compounds, products or \nprocesses that we develop or that are developed on our behalf may become obsolete before we recover any expenses incurred in connection with their development. We face substantial competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other companies, universities and research institutions with respect to NTM lung disease, bronchiectasis, PAH and PH-ILD, and our gene therapy indications, and will face substantial competition with respect to future product candidates we may develop in these and other disease areas. Relative to us, most of these entities have substantially greater capital resources, research and development staffs, facilities and experience in conducting clinical studies, obtaining regulatory approvals, and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Many of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or obtain patent protection earlier than us. Furthermore, we believe that our competitors have used, and may continue to use, litigation and patent office challenges to gain a competitive advantage. Our competitors may also use different technologies or approaches to develop products similar to ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP, INS1201, and our pre-clinical product candidates.\nWe expect that competing successfully will depend on, among other things, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the clinical testing and regulatory approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market, as well as product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, timing and scope of regulatory approval and price. We expect competition to increase as technological advances are made and commercial applications broaden. There are potential competitive products, both approved and in development, which include oral, systemic, or inhaled antibiotic products to treat chronic respiratory infections. For instance, certain entities have expressed interest in studying their products for lung disease and are seeking to advance studies in lung disease, including NTM lung disease caused by mycobacterial species other than MAC. We are not aware of any entities currently conducting clinical trials for the treatment of refractory MAC lung disease or of any other approved inhaled therapies specifically indicated for NTM lung disease in North America, Europe or Japan. If any of our competitors develops a product that is more effective, safe, tolerable or convenient, or less expensive than ARIKAYCE or our product candidates, it would likely materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue. We also may face lower priced generic competitors if third-party payors encourage use of generic or lower-priced versions of our product or if competing products are imported into the US or other countries where we may sell ARIKAYCE. In addition, in an effort to put downward pressure on drug pricing, Congress and the FDA are working to facilitate generic competition, which could result in our experiencing competition earlier than otherwise would be the case.\nThere are also other amikacin products that have been approved by the FDA, MHLW and other regulatory agencies for use in other indications, and physicians may elect to prescribe those products rather than ARIKAYCE to treat the indications for which ARIKAYCE has received approval, which is commonly referred to as off-label use. Although regulations prohibit a drug company from promoting off-label use of its product, the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate the practice of medicine and cannot direct physicians as to what product to prescribe to their patients. As a result, we would have limited ability to prevent any off-label use of a competitor’s product to treat diseases for which we have received FDA or other regulatory agency approval, even if this use violates our patents or any statutory exclusivities that the FDA may grant for the use of amikacin to treat such diseases. \nIn addition, based in part on our successful phase 2b Willow trial in bronchiectasis, certain entities have expressed interest in studying other DPP1 inhibitors for the treatment of bronchiectasis. We are aware of at least two entities currently conducting clinical trials for the treatment of bronchiectasis with a DPP1 inhibitor. If any of these competitors develops a DPP1 inhibitor product that is more effective, safe, tolerable or convenient, it would likely materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue, should brensocatib ultimately be approved. If we are unable to compete successfully, it will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nWe have a limited number of significant customers and losing any of them could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur three largest customers as of December 31, 2024 accounted for 85% and 88% of our total gross product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The degree to which a limited number of customers make up a significant portion of our gross product revenue may change as we continue to commercialize ARIKAYCE and, if approved, our product candidates in additional markets. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to sustain our accounts receivable or gross sales levels from our key customers. If, for any reason, we were to lose, or experience a decrease in the amount of business with our largest customers, whether directly or through our distributor relationships, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nDeterioration in general economic conditions in the United States, Europe, Japan and globally, including the effect of prolonged periods of inflation on our suppliers, third-party service providers and potential partners, could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions. These conditions include but are not limited to inflation, rising interest rates, limited availability of financing, energy availability and costs, the negative impacts caused by public health crises, negative impacts resulting from the military conflict between Russia and the Ukraine or the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, relations between the US and China, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Impacts of such conditions could be passed on to our \nbusiness in the form of higher costs for labor and materials, possible reductions in pharmaceutical industry-wide spending on research and development and acquisitions and higher costs of capital.\nThe emergence of a pandemic, and efforts to reduce its spread, could negatively impact our business and operations.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and pandemics, particularly as the patients we seek to treat suffer from serious diseases that may make them especially vulnerable. A pandemic, including a resurgence of COVID-19, may also have an adverse impact on our operations and supply chain as a result of (i) our or our third-party manufacturers’ employees or other key personnel becoming infected, (ii) preventive and precautionary measures that governments and we and other businesses, including our third-party manufacturers, are taking, such as border closures, prolonged quarantines and other travel restrictions, (iii) shortages of supplies necessary for the manufacture of ARIKAYCE, including as a result of government orders providing for the requisition of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies and equipment, and (iv) cold-chain storage and shipping limitations resulting from the need to prioritize delivery of vaccines, which could cause disruptions or delays in our ability to distribute ARIKAYCE due to lack of sufficient cold-chain storage and shipping capacity. Any of these circumstances could impact the ability of third parties on which we rely to manufacture ARIKAYCE or its components and our ability to perform critical functions, which could significantly hamper our ability to supply ARIKAYCE to patients. While we have experienced no disruption to date in our supply chain due to a pandemic, if we encounter delays or difficulties in the manufacturing process that disrupt our ability to supply ARIKAYCE, we may not be able to satisfy patient demand or we may experience a product stock-out, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe emergence of a pandemic could also require us to delay the start of new clinical trials or otherwise impair our ability to complete those trials. For instance, our ability to enroll patients and retain principal investigators and site staff could be impaired due to an outbreak in their geography or prioritization of hospital resources toward the outbreak, or as a result of quarantines and other travel restrictions that interrupt healthcare services. Furthermore, patients, investigators, or site staff may be unwilling or unable to comply with clinical trial protocols due to illness, concerns about a pandemic, or quarantines or other travel restrictions that impede their movement. Additionally, any interruption in the supply of the study drug might delay our ability to start or complete clinical trials. Significant delays in the timing and completion of our clinical trials are costly and could adversely affect our ability to satisfy our post-marketing requirements for ARIKAYCE and to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our product candidates.\nOur current and potential future use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning may not be successful and presents new risks and challenges to our business.\nWe currently integrate AI and machine learning in certain of our research and development activities, including identification of potential product candidates, and are seeking to further integrate AI and machine learning throughout our business. We are exploring additional opportunities to incorporate AI and machine learning into our processes for drug discovery, drug development, drug commercialization, and in connection with our enabling functions. For example, we are currently evaluating the use of AI to produce initial drafts of documents like clinical study reports. Such efforts may not be successful. Issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as AI and machine learning may cause us to experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, legal liability, and new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, and we may incur additional costs to resolve such issues. \nAs with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could undermine or slow its adoption, and therefore harm our business. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase our operating costs due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. The use of AI by us and our business partners may lead to novel and urgent cybersecurity risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and reputation as well as the operations of any of our business partners. We may also face increased competition from other companies that are using AI, some of whom may develop more effective methods than we and any of our business partners have, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, our efforts to develop, acquire or integrate these technologies will involve significant time, costs, and other resources, and may divert our management team’s attention and focus from executing on other elements of our strategy. Furthermore, uncertainties regarding developing legal and regulatory requirements and standards may require significant resources to modify and maintain business practices to comply with US and non-US laws concerning the use of AI, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, the value of ARIKAYCE and our product candidates could be materially diminished.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal, technical, scientific and factual questions, and our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our \nproprietary technology and to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, prevent third parties from infringing our patents, both domestically and internationally. We have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the US and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Any conclusions we may reach regarding non-infringement, inapplicability or invalidity of a third party’s intellectual property vis-à-vis our proprietary rights, or those of a licensor, are based in significant part on a review of publicly available databases and other information. There may be information not available to us or otherwise not reviewed by us that could render these conclusions inaccurate. Our competitors may also be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nAdditionally, patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented through litigation, either in district court, the US international trade commission (ITC) or US patent office (USPTO), or in analogous foreign courts and patent offices, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or reduce the term of patent protection for ARIKAYCE or our product candidates. US patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference or derivation proceedings, and US patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings, reissue, post-grant review and/or inter partes review in the USPTO. Our foreign patents have been and may be in the future subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office, which could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. See Intellectual Property—ARIKAYCE Patents in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our European patents that have been previously opposed.\nChanges in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the US and other countries may also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, including making it easier for competitors to challenge our patents. For example, the America Invents Act included a number of changes to established practices, including the transition to a first-inventor-to-file system and new procedures for challenging patents and implementation of different methods for invalidating patents.\nIf we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of ARIKAYCE and our product candidates could be materially diminished.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality and restrictive covenant agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors, collaborators, and other third parties and partners to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information or may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, third parties may independently develop or discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Regulators also may disclose information we consider to be proprietary to third parties under certain circumstances, including in response to third-party requests for such disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act or comparable laws. Additionally, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, continues to consider whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time whether and how the FDA’s disclosure policies may change in the future. Further, several states have limited or prohibited the use of post-employment non-compete agreements and the Federal Trade Commission is evaluating a federal-level prohibition on such agreements, which could increase the difficulty of protecting trade secrets and other proprietary information. There are similar risks outside the US, such as the risk that a foreign regulatory agency would make available information we consider to be proprietary to third parties or the public, and the risks arising from other factors making it difficult to protect trade secrets, such as prohibitions or restrictions on post-employment non-compete agreements and other rules and regulations. \nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could harm our business.\nThe legal systems of some foreign countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in such foreign jurisdictions. For example, certain foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be required to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. This legal environment could make it \ndifficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or in-licensed patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. \nThe drug research and development industry has a history of intellectual property litigation, and we could become involved in costly intellectual property disputes, which could delay or impair our product development efforts or prevent us from, or increase the cost of, commercializing ARIKAYCE or any other approved product candidate.\nThird parties may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their proprietary rights. Any existing third-party patents, or patents that may later issue to third parties, could negatively affect our commercialization of ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP, INS1201, or any other product candidate that receives regulatory approval. For instance, PAH is a competitive indication with established products, including other formulations of treprostinil. Our supply of treprostinil palmitil, the treprostinil prodrug present in TPIP, is dependent upon a single supplier. The supplier owns patents on its manufacturing process and crystalline drug product, and we have filed patent applications for TPIP; however, a competitor in the PAH or PH-ILD indication may claim that we or our supplier have infringed upon or misappropriated its proprietary rights. Moreover, in the event that we pursue approval of TPIP, or any other product candidate, via the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we will be required to file a certification of non-infringement or invalidity against any unexpired patents listed in the Orange Book for the third-party drug we reference as part of our regulatory submission. This certification process may lead to litigation and could also delay launch of a product candidate, if approved by regulators.\nIn the event of successful litigation or settlement of claims against us for infringement or misappropriation of a third party’s proprietary rights, we may be required to take actions including but not limited to the following:\n•Paying damages, including up to treble damages, royalties, and the other party’s attorneys’ fees, which may be substantial;\n•Ceasing development, manufacture, marketing and sale of products or use of processes that infringe the proprietary rights of others;\n•Expending significant resources to redesign our products or our processes so that they do not infringe the proprietary rights of others, which may not be possible, or may result in significant regulatory delays associated with conducting additional clinical trials or other steps to obtain regulatory approval; and/or\n•Acquiring one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may also have to undertake costly litigation or engage in other proceedings, such as interference or inter partes review, to enforce or defend the validity of any patents issued or licensed to us, to confirm the scope and validity of our or a licensor’s proprietary rights or to defend against allegations that we have infringed a third party’s intellectual property rights. Any proceedings regarding our intellectual property rights are likely to be time consuming and may divert management attention from operation of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nCertain of the agreements to which we are, or may become, a party relating to ARIKAYCE and our product candidates impose, or may in the future impose, restrictions on our business or other material obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our business could be adversely affected, including as a result of the loss of license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to various agreements related to ARIKAYCE and our product candidates, including licensing agreements with PARI and AstraZeneca, which we view as material to our business. For additional information regarding the terms of these agreements, see Business—License and Other Agreements in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These agreements impose a number of obligations on us and our business, including restrictions on our ability to freely develop or commercialize our product candidates and requirements to make milestone and royalty payments to our counterparties upon certain events. For example, under our license agreement with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca retains a right of first negotiation pursuant to which it may exclusively negotiate with us before we can negotiate with a third party regarding any transaction to develop or commercialize brensocatib, subject to certain exceptions. While this right of first negotiation is not triggered by a change of control, it may impede or delay our ability to consummate certain other transactions involving brensocatib.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, our counterparties may have the right to take action against us, up to and including termination of a relevant license. For instance, under our license agreement with AstraZeneca, AstraZeneca may terminate our license to brensocatib if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a product based on brensocatib, or we are subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency. Reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms and may materially harm our business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation \nGovernment healthcare reform could materially increase our costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in or revisions to laws and regulations that make gaining regulatory approval, reimbursement and pricing more difficult or subject to different criteria and standards may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. \nThere have been a number of legal challenges and certain changes to the ACA since it was enacted. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including, among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. Further, on February 10, 2021, the Biden Administration withdrew the federal government’s support for overturning the ACA. Changes to the ACA, to the Medicare or Medicaid programs, or to the ability of the federal government to negotiate or otherwise affect drug prices, or other federal legislation regarding healthcare access, financing or legislation in individual states, could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock. We may face similar challenges to gaining regulatory approval and sufficient reimbursement and pricing due to government healthcare reform in the EU, Japan and other jurisdictions where ARIKAYCE or any of our other product candidates are approved. The Trump Administration has discussed several changes to the reach and oversight of the FDA, which could affect its relationship with the pharmaceutical industry, transparency in decision making and ultimately the cost and availability of prescription drugs. Drug pricing is an active area for regulatory reform at both the federal and state levels, and additional significant changes to current drug pricing and reimbursement structures in the US could be forthcoming. It remains unclear how any new legislation or regulation might affect the prices we may obtain for ARIKAYCE or any of our product candidates for which regulatory approval is obtained.\nIf we are found in violation of federal or state “fraud and abuse” laws, we may be required to pay a penalty or may be suspended from participation in federal or state healthcare programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nIn the US, we are subject to various federal and state healthcare “fraud and abuse” laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other laws intended to reduce fraud and abuse in federal and state healthcare programs. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with all applicable requirements, these laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the US government, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected. Our reputation could also suffer. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nUnder the ACA and certain state laws, we are required to report information on payments or transfers of value to any US physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, or certified nurse-midwives (in each case who are not bona fide employees of the applicable manufacturer that is reporting the payment) and teaching hospitals, which is posted in searchable form on a public website. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties.\nSeveral states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. In addition to the federal government, some states, as well as other countries, including France, require the disclosure of certain payments to healthcare professionals. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), state, and foreign privacy laws may limit access to information identifying those individuals who may be prospective users or limit the ability to market to them. Some of these laws are new or ambiguous as to what is required to comply with their requirements, and we could be subject to penalties if it is determined that we have failed to comply with an applicable legal requirement. \nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws and trade control laws, as well as other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to negative publicity, civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The FCPA, UK Bribery Act and these other laws generally prohibit us, our employees and our intermediaries from making prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We have conducted various studies at a broad range of trial sites around the world. Certain of these jurisdictions pose a risk of potential FCPA violations, and we have relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the US Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and various non-US government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations and transfer pricing regulations (collectively, Trade Control laws).\nWe may not be effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock. Likewise, even an investigation by US or foreign authorities of potential violations of the FCPA other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities used in the production of ARIKAYCE and our product candidates involve the use of hazardous materials, which could expose us to damages, fines, penalties and sanctions and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our research and development program and manufacturing activities for ARIKAYCE and our product candidates involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. \nAlthough we strive to comply with all pertinent regulations, the risk of environmental contamination, damage to facilities or injury to personnel from the accidental or improper use or control of these materials remains. In addition to any liability we could have for any misuse by us of hazardous materials and chemicals, we could also potentially be liable for activities of our CMOs or other third parties. Any such liability, or even allegations of such liability, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We also could incur significant costs as a result of civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nInadequate funding for the FDA and other government agencies and/or potentially shifting priorities under the new administration could hinder the FDA's and/or those other government agencies' ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products, provide feedback on clinical trials and development programs, meet with sponsors and otherwise review regulatory submissions can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels; ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees; and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, among other factors. Average review times at the agency may fluctuate as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies on which our operations may rely is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. \nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also increase the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies or to otherwise respond to regulatory submissions, such as our NDA submission for brensocatib, which would adversely affect our business. For example the Trump Administration has discussed several changes to the reach and oversight of the FDA, which could affect its relationship with the pharmaceutical industry, transparency in decision making and ultimately the cost and availability of prescription drugs. Additionally, over the last several years, the US government has shut down multiple times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA and other government employees and stop critical activities. If funding for the FDA is reduced, FDA priorities \nchange, or a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, including our NDA submission for brensocatib, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have a history of operating losses, expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred losses each previous year of our operation, except in 2009, when we sold our manufacturing facility and certain other assets to Merck & Co, Inc. As of December 31, 2024, our accumulated deficit was $4.4 billion. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our consolidated net loss was $913.8 million, $749.6 million and $481.5 million, respectively. Our ability to generate revenue depends on the success of commercial sales of ARIKAYCE; however, we do not anticipate our revenue from the sale of ARIKAYCE will be sufficient for us to become profitable without reductions in our operating expenses. Despite commercialization of ARIKAYCE in the US, Europe and Japan, we expect to continue to incur substantial operating expenses, and resulting operating losses, for the foreseeable future as we:\n•Initiate or continue clinical studies of our product candidates;\n•Complete a post-marketing clinical trial of ARIKAYCE, consisting of the completed ARISE and ongoing ENCORE trials, as required by the FDA;\n•Seek to discover or in-license additional product candidates;\n•Support the sales and marketing efforts necessary for the continued commercialization of ARIKAYCE;\n•Scale-up manufacturing capabilities for future ARIKAYCE production, including the increase of production capacity at Patheon and process improvements in order to manufacture at a larger commercial scale;\n•Seek the approval of brensocatib in the US and other markets and, if approved, support the commercial launch of brensocatib and scale-up manufacturing capabilities for brensocatib;\n•Seek the approval of TPIP and other product candidates in various markets and, if approved, support the commercial launch of TPIP;\n•File, prosecute, defend, and enforce patent claims related to ARIKAYCE, brensocatib, TPIP, INS1201 and our other product candidates; and\n•Enhance operational, compliance, financial, quality and information management systems and hire more personnel, including personnel to support our commercialization efforts and development of our product candidates.\nEven if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to continue our operations, and any failure to obtain capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, reduce, or eliminate our development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since our inception. We expect to expend substantial financial resources on pre-commercialization activities and the regulatory approval process for brensocatib, to continue to commercialize ARIKAYCE and conduct the confirmatory post-marketing ENCORE trial, seek full regulatory approval for ARIKAYCE, as well as continue research and development of brensocatib, TPIP, and INS1201, as well as our other current and future product candidates. We may need to raise additional capital to fund these activities, including due to changes in our product development plans or misjudgment of expected costs, to fund corporate development, to maintain our intellectual property portfolio or for other purposes, including to resolve litigation. Our operating expenses and long-term investments were significantly higher in 2024 than in 2023, reflecting our continued investment in the build-out of our commercial organization to support global expansion activities for ARIKAYCE, preparation for the commercial launch of brensocatib if approved for the treatment of bronchiectasis, the manufacture of commercial inventory, which includes capital and long-term investments, and continued investment in research and development as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. We do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed, or, if available, whether the terms will be favorable. If adequate funds are not available to us when needed, we may be forced to delay, restrict or eliminate all or a portion of our development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes, a term loan and a royalty financing arrangement and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our financial position, prevent us from implementing our strategy, and dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.\nIn October 2022, we entered into a loan agreement (the Loan Agreement) with certain funds managed by Pharmakon and a revenue interest purchase agreement (the Royalty Financing Agreement) with OrbiMed. In October 2024, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (the A&R Loan Agreement) and amended the Royalty Financing Agreement.\nThe A&R Loan Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan of $350.0 million (in addition to the accrual and capitalization of $46.8 million of paid-in-kind interest under the Loan Agreement), which we drew in full in connection with our entry into the Loan Agreement (the Tranche A Term Loan). The A&R Loan Agreement amends the Loan Agreement to, among other items, add a new $150.0 million senior secured term loan tranche (the Tranche B Term Loan and, together with the Tranche A Term Loan, the Term Loans). The Term Loans bear interest at a fixed rate of 9.60% per annum. The A&R Loan Agreement extends the maturity date of the Term Loans to September 30, 2029, subject to acceleration to February 1, 2028 on the occurrence of certain prespecified events. As consideration for the provision of the Tranche B Term Loan, we agreed to pay Pharmakon a fee equal to 2.00% of the Tranche B Term Loan at the closing date of the Tranche B Term Loan and an additional exit fee of 2.00% of the amount of each prepayment or repayment of the Term Loans. The Term Loans will be repaid in eight equal quarterly payments starting on January 3, 2028.\nUnder the Royalty Financing Agreement, OrbiMed paid us $150.0 million in exchange for the right to receive, on a quarterly basis, royalties (the Royalty Financing) in an amount equal to 4.0% of ARIKAYCE global net sales prior to September 1, 2025 and 4.5% of ARIKAYCE global net sales on or after September 1, 2025, as well as 0.75% of brensocatib global net sales, if approved (the Revenue Interest Payments). In the event that OrbiMed has not received aggregate Revenue Interest Payments equal to or greater than $150.0 million on or prior to March 31, 2028, the royalty rate for ARIKAYCE will be increased for all subsequent fiscal quarters to a rate that, if applied retroactively, would have resulted in aggregate Revenue Interest Payments to OrbiMed for all fiscal quarters ended on or prior to March 31, 2028 equal to $150.0 million. In addition, we must make a one-time payment to OrbiMed in an amount that, when added to the aggregate amount of Revenue Interest Payments received by OrbiMed as of March 31, 2028, would equal $150.0 million. The total Revenue Interest Payments payable by us to OrbiMed are capped at 1.8x of the purchase price or up to a maximum of 1.9x of the purchase price under certain conditions.\nIn May 2021, we completed an underwritten offering of 0.75% convertible senior notes due in 2028 (the 2028 Convertible Notes). The 2028 Convertible Notes may be convertible into common stock at an initial conversion rate of 30.7692 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes. We sold $575.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes, including the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional 2028 Convertible Notes, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $559.3 million. Holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes may convert their 2028 Convertible Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2028, only under certain circumstances, which circumstances have existed each quarter since the third quarter of 2024. On or after March 1, 2028, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their 2028 Convertible Notes at any time. Upon conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we may deliver cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.\nOur debt service obligations and the degree to which we are leveraged could have negative consequences on our business, such as the following:\n•We may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures, and less flexible in responding to changing economic conditions;\n•Our ability to obtain financing in the future may be limited; \n•We may be required to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n•We may be placed at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources;\n•A substantial portion of our cash flows from operations in the future may be required for the payment of our interest or principal payments under the A&R Loan Agreement, Revenue Interest Payments under the Royalty Financing Agreement and the principal amounts of the 2028 Convertible Notes when they or any additional indebtedness become due, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes, including funds for clinical development or to pursue future business opportunities; and\n•We may elect to make cash payments upon conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes, which would reduce our available cash.\nOur ability to pay principal or interest on or, if desired, to refinance our indebtedness, including the A&R Loan Agreement, the Royalty Financing Agreement and the 2028 Convertible Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy any obligations under the A&R Loan Agreement, the Royalty Financing Agreement or the 2028 Convertible Notes or our obligations under any future indebtedness we may incur. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to delay, restrict or eliminate all or a portion of our development programs or commercialization efforts or refinance or obtain additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. If we do not meet our debt obligations, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nThe A&R Loan Agreement and the Royalty Financing Agreement each contain customary affirmative and negative covenants that restrict our operations, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to incur liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, engage in certain mergers and acquisitions or asset sales, and declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock. The A&R Loan Agreement includes certain customary events of default. If a default occurs and is continuing, we may be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the A&R Loan Agreement. The Royalty Financing Agreement gives OrbiMed the option (the Put Option) to terminate the Royalty Financing Agreement and to require us to repurchase future Revenue Interest Payments upon enumerated events such as a bankruptcy event, a payment default, an uncured material breach or a change of control. The triggering of the Put Option, including by our failure to comply with these covenants, could permit OrbiMed to declare certain amounts to be immediately due and payable. Further, if we are liquidated, Pharmakon’s and OrbiMed’s rights to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock. Any triggering of the Put Option or other event of default under the A&R Loan Agreement or Royalty Financing Agreement could significantly harm our financial condition, business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness in the future which would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in additional restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license assets or intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nWe may be unable to use certain of our net operating losses and other tax assets.\nWe have substantial tax loss carry forwards in the US (both federal and state), Ireland, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. In general, our net operating losses and tax credits have been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize these tax benefits. In particular, our ability to fully use certain US tax loss carry forwards and general business tax credit carry forwards recorded prior to December 2010 to offset future income or tax liability is limited under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Changes in the ownership of our stock, including those resulting from the issuance of shares of our common stock offerings or upon exercise of outstanding options, may limit or eliminate our ability to use certain net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards in the future.\nChanges in our effective income tax rate and future changes to US and non-US tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the US and various ex-US jurisdictions in which we operate globally. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable impacts on our effective tax rate, including changes in tax rates and laws, interpretations of existing laws, changes in accounting standards, changes in the jurisdiction of our pre-tax earnings and examinations of our tax filings.\nGoodwill impairment charges in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. We review the recoverability of goodwill annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable.\nThe impairment tests require us to make an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. An impairment could be recorded as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. Since a number of factors may influence determinations of fair value of goodwill, we are unable to predict whether impairments of goodwill will occur in the future, and there can be no assurance that continued conditions will not result in future impairments of goodwill. The future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment could include matters such as (i) a decrease in expected net earnings, (ii) adverse equity market conditions, (iii) a decline in current market multiples, (iv) a decline in our common stock price, (v) a significant adverse change in legal factors or the general business climate, and (vi) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. Any such impairment would result in us recognizing a non-cash charge in our consolidated financial statements, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock \nOur shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock for general corporate purposes and upon the conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes.\nIn the future, we may issue additional equity securities for capital raising purposes, in connection with hiring or retaining employees, to fund acquisitions, or for other business purposes. We have previously funded, and expect to continue to fund, acquisitions using shares of our common stock as consideration. In addition, we may issue shares of our common stock upon the conversion of our 2028 Convertible Notes. The conversion of some or all of the 2028 Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders to the extent we deliver shares upon their conversion. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2028 Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the \nconversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. The future issuance of any additional shares of common stock will dilute our current shareholders and may create downward pressure on the value of our shares. The potential for the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock pursuant to the 2028 Convertible Notes could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an “overhang” and in anticipation of which the market price of our stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could also hinder our ability to raise additional equity capital at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nThe market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, which could lead to shareholder litigation against us.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “INSM”. The market price of our stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, including those discussed herein, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, which have particularly affected the market prices for emerging biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies like us, and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance. \nHistorically, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, shareholders are more likely to institute securities and derivative class action litigation against the issuer of such stock. We previously faced a shareholder suit following a decline in our stock price. If any of our shareholders bring a lawsuit against us in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have insurance policies related to some of the risks associated with our business, including directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies; however, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient and our insurance carriers may not cover all claims in a given litigation. If we are not successful in our defense of claims asserted in shareholder litigation, those claims are not covered by insurance or they exceed our insurance coverage, we may have to pay damage awards, indemnify our executive officers, directors and third parties from damage awards that may be entered against them and pay our and their costs and expenses incurred in defense of, or in any settlement of, such claims. In addition, such shareholder suits could divert the time and attention of management from our business.\nCertain provisions of Virginia law, our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and arrangements between us and our employees could hamper a third party’s acquisition of us or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us.\nCertain provisions of Virginia law, our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and arrangements with our employees could hamper a third party’s acquisition of us or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us, or limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. These provisions or arrangements include:\n•The ability to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock without any further vote or action by the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of our common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of our common stock. In certain circumstances, such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.\n•The existence of a staggered board of directors in which there are three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms, thus expanding the time required to change the composition of a majority of directors.\n•The requirement that shareholders provide advance notice when nominating director candidates to serve on our board of directors.\n•The inability of shareholders to convene a shareholders’ meeting without the chairman of the board, the president or a majority of the board of directors first calling the meeting.\n•The prohibition against entering into a business combination with the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the 10% or greater owner first reached that level of stock ownership, unless certain criteria are met.\n•In addition to severance agreements with our officers and provisions in our incentive plans that permit acceleration of equity awards upon a change in control, a severance plan for eligible full-time employees that provides such employees with severance equal to six months of their then-current base salaries in connection with a termination of employment without cause upon, or within 18 months following, a change in control.\nUnder Virginia law, our board of directors may implement a shareholders’ rights plan or \"poison pill\" without shareholder approval. Our board of directors regularly considers this matter, even in the absence of specific circumstances or takeover proposals, to facilitate its future ability to quickly and effectively protect shareholder value.",
