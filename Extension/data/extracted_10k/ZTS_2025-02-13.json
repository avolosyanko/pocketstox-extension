Business.\nOverview \nZoetis Inc. is a global leader in the animal health industry, focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of medicines, vaccines, diagnostic products and services, biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health. We have a diversified business, commercializing products across eight core species: dogs, cats and horses (collectively, companion animals) and cattle, swine, poultry, fish and sheep (collectively, livestock); and within seven major product categories: parasiticides, vaccines, dermatology, anti-infectives, pain and sedation, other pharmaceutical and animal health diagnostics. For over 70 years, we have been innovating ways to predict, prevent, detect, and treat animal illness, and continue to stand by those raising and caring for animals worldwide - from veterinarians and pet owners to livestock producers.\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2012 and prior to that the company was a business unit of Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer). The address of our principal executive offices is 10 Sylvan Way, Parsippany, New Jersey 07054. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Zoetis,” “the company,” “we,” “us” or “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (2024 Annual Report) refer to Zoetis Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. In addition, unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Pfizer” in this 2024 Annual Report refer to Pfizer Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. \nOperating Segments\nThe animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostics market is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions. This is due to a variety of factors, including: \n•economic differences, such as standards of living in developed markets as compared to emerging markets; \n•cultural differences, such as dietary preferences for different animal proteins, pet ownership preferences and pet care standards; \n•epidemiological differences, such as the prevalence of certain bacterial and viral strains and disease dynamics; \n•treatment differences, such as utilization of different types of medicines and vaccines, as well as the pace of adoption of new technologies; \n•environmental differences, such as seasonality, climate and the availability of arable land and fresh water; and \n•regulatory differences, such as standards for product approval and manufacturing. \nAs a result of these differences, among other things, we organize and operate our business in two segments: \n•United States (U.S.) with revenue of $5,074 million, or 55% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024; and \n•International with revenue of $4,102 million, or 44% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. \nWithin each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio for both companion animal and livestock customers so that we can capitalize on local trends and customer needs. \nIn addition, our Client Supply Services (CSS) organization which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties, and our human health products, together represented approximately 1% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n1 |\n\n\nOur 2024 revenue for the U.S. and key international markets, together with the percentage of revenue attributable to companion animal and livestock products in those markets, is as follows:\n(MILLIONS OF DOLLARS)              Revenue        Companion Animal         Livestock\nUnited States                       $5,074                     80%               20%\nTotal International                 $4,102                     54%               46%\nAustralia                             $319                     53%               47%\nBrazil                                $414                     41%               59%\nCanada                                $277                     62%               38%\nChile                                 $123                     23%               77%\nChina                                 $270                     69%               31%\nFrance                                $156                     66%               34%\nGermany                               $225                     77%               23%\nItaly                                 $129                     78%               22%\nJapan                                 $147                     70%               30%\nMexico                                $169                     36%               64%\nSpain                                 $130                     60%               40%\nUnited Kingdom                        $314                     78%               22%\nOther Developed                       $564                     49%               51%\nOther Emerging                        $865                     42%               58%\n![alt  2224](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555280/000155528025000102/zts-20241231_g1.jpg)\nFor additional information regarding our performance in each of our operating segments and the impact of foreign exchange rates, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 4. Revenue and Note 19. Segment Information. Our 2024 reported revenue for each segment, by species, is as follows:\n2 |\n\n\nProducts \nOver the course of our history, we have focused on developing a diverse portfolio of animal health products that deliver solutions across the continuum of care. We refer to all products with the same primary active pharmaceutical or biological ingredient(s) as a single product line, even if such products include different brands, dosages, formulations or indicated species. For vaccines, we typically consider a group of vaccines as a single product line if they share the same brand. We have approximately 300 comprehensive product lines, including products for both companion animals and livestock within each of our major product categories.\nOur companion animal products help extend and improve the quality of life for pets; increase convenience and compliance for pet owners; and help veterinarians improve the quality of their care and the efficiency of their businesses. Growth in the companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics sectors is driven by increases in spending on pet care, economic development and related increases in disposable income. Companion animals are also living longer, deepening the human-animal bond, receiving increased medical treatment and benefiting from advances in animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. Companion animal products represented approximately 68% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOur livestock products focus on predicting, preventing, detecting and treating diseases, with the understanding that veterinarians and livestock producers must have the tools at their disposal to treat disease expeditiously, which in turn enables the sustainable production of safe, high-quality animal protein. Human population growth and increased standards of living continue to drive demand for increased production of quality animal protein. Population growth leads to greater consumption of natural resources, driving a need for innovative solutions to increase sustainability and productivity. As global food security takes on heightened importance, producers are tasked with facilitating a high quality, safe and reliable food supply. Livestock products represented approximately 31% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn addition, our CSS organization, which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties, and our human health products, together represented approximately 1% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nOn October 31, 2024, we completed the divestiture of our medicated feed additive product portfolio, certain water soluble products and related assets, and, as a result, our major product categories no longer include the category of medicated feed additives. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements— Note 5. Acquisitions and Divestitures.\nOur major product categories are: \n•parasiticides: products that prevent or eliminate external and internal parasites such as fleas, ticks, lice and worms;\n•vaccines: biological preparations that help prevent diseases of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts or induce a specific immune response;\n•dermatology: products that relieve itch associated with allergic conditions and atopic dermatitis;\n•anti-infectives: products that prevent, kill or slow the growth of bacteria, fungi or protozoa;\n•pain and sedation: products that alleviate pain, primarily associated with osteoarthritis and postoperative pain;\n•other pharmaceutical: antiemetic, reproductive and oncology products; and\n•animal health diagnostics: testing and analysis of blood, urine and other animal samples and related products and services, including point-of-care diagnostic products, instruments and reagents, rapid immunoassay tests, reference laboratory kits and services and blood glucose monitors. \nOur remaining revenue is derived from other non-pharmaceutical product categories, such as nutritionals, as well as products and services in biodevices, genetic tests and precision animal health.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we focus on the discovery and development of new chemical, biopharmaceutical and biological entities, as well as product lifecycle innovation, primarily through our research and development (R&D) group. Historically, a substantial portion of our products and revenue has been the result of product lifecycle innovation where we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing new claims, extending to additional species, developing more convenient formulations, modifications and combinations, and by expanding usage into more countries. For example, the first product in our ceftiofur line was an anti-infective approved for treating bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in cattle that was administered via intramuscular injection. Through follow-on studies and reformulations, we have expanded the product line into additional cattle claims and administration routes, as well as other species and regions. The ceftiofur product line currently includes the brands Excede®, Excenel®, Naxcel® and Spectramast®.\nThe following are examples of our first-in-class and/or best-in-class products that we have launched and products that we believe may represent platforms for future product lifecycle innovation (listed alphabetically): \n•Apoquel®, the first Janus kinase inhibitor for use in veterinary medicine, was approved in 2013 for the control of pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis and the control of atopic dermatitis in dogs at least 12 months of age. Since January 2014, we have launched Apoquel in many key markets globally. In 2021, a chewable version of Apoquel was approved in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (U.K.), and has since been approved in other key markets globally, including the U.S. in 2023 and China in 2024;\n•Core EQ Innovator®, the first and only vaccine for horses to contain all five core equine disease antigens - West Nile, Eastern and Western Equine encephalomyelitis, tetanus and rabies - in one combination, was approved in the U.S. in 2018 and in Canada in 2019;\n•Cytopoint®, the first canine monoclonal antibody (mAb) to help reduce the clinical signs of atopic dermatitis (such as itching) in dogs of any age, was licensed in the U.S. in 2016 (and was later granted an expanded indication to treat allergic dermatitis in 2018). The product has since been approved in many key markets globally. An injection given once every four to eight weeks, Cytopoint neutralizes interleukin-31, a protein that has been demonstrated to trigger itching in dogs;\n•Fostera® PCV MH was introduced in November 2013 in the U.S. and has since been approved in many key markets globally. It was developed to help protect pigs from porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) and enzootic pneumonia caused by M. hyopneumoniae (M. hyo). Fostera Gold PCV MH, the only vaccine to contain two PCV2 genotypes and long-lasting M. hyo coverage, was approved in the \n3 |\n\n\nU.S. and Canada in 2018 and has since been approved in many key markets globally. The Fostera/Suvaxyn® product line also includes Fostera/Suvaxyn PRRS, which was approved in the U.S. in 2015 and has since been approved in many key markets globally. This vaccine offers protection against both the respiratory and reproductive forms of disease caused by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus;\n•Librela®(bedinvetmab), the first and only injectable mAb therapy for monthly alleviation of osteoarthritis (OA) pain in dogs, was approved in the EU in 2020 and has since been approved in other key markets globally, including the U.S. in 2023 and China in 2024;\n•Poulvac® Procerta® HVT-ND, our first vector vaccine that helps protect against Marek’s disease and Newcastle disease, highly contagious viral infections affecting poultry, was approved in the U.S. in 2019. In 2020, we expanded our line of recombinant vector vaccines with the launch of Poulvac Procerta HVT-IBD, which helps protect against Marek's disease and provides early protection against the contemporary infectious bursal disease (IBD) viruses. We have since expanded Poulvac Procerta HVT-ND into other key markets globally. In 2022, we further expanded our line of recombinant vector vaccines with the launch of Poulvac Procerta HVT-IBD-ND in the U.S., which is an advanced trivalent vector vaccine that delivers powerful early protection against Marek's disease, infectious bursal disease and Newcastle disease in one dose;\n•ProHeart® 6 (moxidectin), a twice a year injection to prevent heartworm disease in dogs 6 months of age and older, was approved in the U.S. in 2021; In 2019, ProHeart® 12 (moxidectin), a once-yearly injection to prevent heartworm disease in dogs 12 months of age and older;\n•Protivity®, a modified-live bacterial vaccine that is effective in protecting healthy beef and dairy cattle against respiratory disease caused by Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis), was approved in the U.S. and Canada in 2022, the EU and Mexico in 2023 and the U.K. in 2024;\n•Revolution® Plus/Stronghold® Plus (selamectin/sarolaner), a topical combination product that treats ticks, fleas, ear mites, lice and gastrointestinal worms and prevents heartworm disease in cats, received EU approval in 2017 and has since been approved in other key markets globally, including the U.S., and received approval in 2024 in key markets globally for new claims related to the treatment and control of lone star tick infestations, flea tapeworm and efficacy against notoedres mange, making it the only parasiticide for cats on the market to defend against four types of ticks;\n•Simparica® (sarolaner) Chewables, a monthly chewable tablet for dogs to control fleas and ticks, was approved in the EU in 2015, the U.S. in 2016 and has since been approved in other key markets globally. Simparica Trio®, a triple combination parasiticide for dogs, was approved in the EU and Canada in 2019, the U.S. in 2020 and has since been approved in other key markets globally. In 2024, Simparica Chewables and Simparica Trio received U.S. approval for new claims related to the treatment and control of lone star tick infestations. This product is a key internal lifecycle innovation that combines flea and tick treatment (sarolaner) with the prevention of heartworm disease and treatment of gastrointestinal parasites;\n•Solensia® (frunevetmab), the first injectable mAb therapy for monthly alleviation of OA pain in cats, was approved in Switzerland in 2020 and has since been approved in other key markets globally, including the EU and the U.S.; and\n•Vanguard®/Versican® is a market leading vaccine line for dogs intended to help prevent a range of diseases. Since 2016, Zoetis has added new and innovative enhancements to this product line in the U.S. and other key markets with Vanguard crLyme, Vanguard Rapid Resp Intranasal, Vanguard B Oral, Vanguard CIV H3N2/H3N8 and Versican Plus Bb Oral.\nWe pursue the development of new vaccines for emerging infectious diseases, with an operating philosophy of “first to know and fast to market.” Examples of the successful execution of this strategy include the first SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine to help protect the health and well-being of more than 300 mammalian species living in zoos, aquariums, conservatories and other animal organizations around the world; the first equine vaccine for West Nile virus in the U.S. and EU; the first swine vaccine for pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in the U.S.; the first conditionally licensed vaccine against the pandemic H5N1 bird flu in the U.S. and EU, which we provided to the U.S. Department of Agriculture when it recommended our vaccine be used by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help protect California condors in 2023; a conditionally licensed vaccine to help fight porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in the U.S.; and the first conditionally licensed vaccine to help prevent the H3N2 type of canine influenza that emerged in the U.S. Because approximately 60% of infectious diseases in humans originate in animals (according to CDC) we take a \"One Health\" approach; vaccinating animals can help contain emerging infectious diseases and limit spread to other species including humans. Since 2020, the company has partnered with Colorado State University to increase our understanding of the potential use of immunomodulators in livestock that could reduce the need for antibiotics, as well as advance our understanding of the biology of key diseases affecting companion animals which could lead to new therapies that can treat chronic health conditions in pets. In 2024, the company started a collaboration with Blacksmith Medicines to discover and develop novel antibiotics for animal health and provide new options for our customers to treat life-threatening infections in livestock.\nAdditionally, the Pharmaq business of Zoetis is the global leader in vaccines and innovation for aquatic health products. By preventing and treating diseases, we believe these products contribute to an increase in animal welfare and an improvement in food safety while lessening the burden on the environment.\nZoetis enhanced the portfolio of its diagnostic products with the acquisition in 2018 of Abaxis, Inc. (Abaxis), a leading provider of veterinary point-of-care diagnostic instruments, including the VetScan® portfolio of benchtop and handheld diagnostic instruments and consumables. In 2023, the company enhanced its Vetscan Imagyst platform by adding artificial intelligence (AI) dermatology and AI fecal for equine, which uses a combination of image recognition technology, algorithms and cloud-based AI to deliver rapid testing results to veterinary clinics. In 2024, the company added AI urine sediment analysis to the Vetscan Imagyst platform and launched Vetscan OptiCellTM a cartridge-based, AI powered hematology analyzer that provides advanced Complete Blood Count (CBC) analysis. As Zoetis continues to develop additional innovative applications for Vetscan Imagyst, it plans to seamlessly integrate even more new capabilities into the platform, helping veterinarians provide the best possible care for animals. \nIn 2022, the company completed the acquisition of Jurox, an animal health company based in Australia, which brings the company a range of companion animal and livestock products and provides the company with future growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity and increased capabilities in Australia. Also in 2022, the company acquired Basepaws, a petcare genetics company that provides pet owners with genetic tests, analytics and early health risk assessments, which help pet owners and veterinarians understand an individual pet’s risk for disease and helps Zoetis identify solutions to complex diseases by informing our research and innovation.\n4 |\n\n\nIn 2023, the company completed the acquisition of PetMedix Ltd, a privately held research and development stage animal health biopharmaceutical company based in the U.K., which develops antibody-based therapeutics for companion animals. Also in 2023, the company completed the acquisition of adivo GmbH, a privately held research and development stage animal health biopharmaceutical company based in Germany. \nIn 2024, our two top-selling products and product lines, Simparica/Simparica Trio and Apoquel/Apoquel Chewable, contributed approximately 15% and 11%, respectively, of our revenue. Combined with our next three top-selling products and product lines, Cytopoint, Librela and our ceftiofur line, these five products and product lines contributed approximately 41% of our revenue. In 2024, our ten top-selling products and product lines contributed approximately 55% of our revenue. \nOur products and product lines that represented approximately 1% or more of our revenue in 2024, which comprise approximately 69% of our total revenue, are as follows (listed alphabetically by product category):\nCompanion animal products\nProduct / product line

Operations outside the U.S. accounted for 44% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. We continue to benefit from our past efforts to establish an early and direct presence in many emerging markets, such as Brazil, Chile, China and Mexico, and we believe we are one of the largest animal health medicines and vaccines businesses as measured by revenue across emerging markets as a whole.\nOur international businesses are subject, in varying degrees, to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. These include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange control regulations, expropriation and other restrictive government actions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors— Risks related to operating in foreign jurisdictions. \nSales and Marketing \nOur sales organization includes sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists. We also contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for many of our products. In regions where we do not maintain a direct commercial presence, we rely solely on distributors for these services. \nOur sales representatives visit our customers, including veterinarians and livestock producers, to provide information and to promote and sell our products and services. Our technical and veterinary operations specialists, who generally have advanced veterinary medicine degrees, provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management, training and education on many topics, including responsible product use. These direct relationships with customers allow us to understand the needs of our customers. Additionally, our sales representatives and technical and veterinary operations specialists partner with customers to provide training and support in areas of disease awareness and treatment protocols, including the use of our products. As a result of these relationships, our sales and consulting visits are typically longer, more meaningful and provide us with better access to customer decision makers as compared to those in human health. In certain markets, including the U.S., pet owners are taking a more active role in product purchasing decisions, and as a result we are increasingly investing in direct-to-consumer marketing efforts. As of December 31, 2024, our sales organization consisted of approximately 4,050 employees. \nOur companion animal and livestock products are primarily available by prescription through a veterinarian. In certain markets, we also sell certain products through retail and e-commerce outlets. We also market our products by advertising to veterinarians, pet owners and livestock producers.\nCustomers\nWe primarily sell our companion animal products to veterinarians or to third-party veterinary distributors that typically then sell our products to veterinarians, and in each case veterinarians then typically sell our products to pet owners. In certain markets, we also sell companion animal products through retail, including pharmacies, and e-commerce outlets. We sell our livestock products primarily to veterinarians and livestock producers, including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork and poultry operators, in addition to third-party veterinary distributors and retail outlets \n6 |\n\n\nwho then typically sell the products to livestock producers. Sales to our largest customer, a U.S. veterinary distributor, represented approximately 14% of total revenue for 2024.\nResearch and Development \nOur R&D operations are comprised of a dedicated veterinary medicine R&D organization, external alliances and other operations focused on the development, registration and regulatory maintenance of our products. In addition, we have R&D operations focused on diagnostics, devices, data, digital and other technological innovation. We incurred R&D expenses of $686 million in 2024, $614 million in 2023 and $539 million in 2022. \nOur R&D efforts are comprised of more than 300 programs and reflect our commitment to develop solutions for unmet needs and advance the current standards of care. We create new insights for predicting, preventing, detecting and treating health conditions that result in the development of new platforms of knowledge which become the basis for continuous innovation. Leveraging internal discoveries, complemented by external research collaborations, results in the delivery of novel vaccine, pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, biodevice and diagnostic products and services to help our customers face their toughest challenges. While the development of new chemical, biopharmaceutical and biological entities through new product R&D plays a critical role in our growth strategies, a significant share of our R&D investment (including regulatory functions) is focused on product lifecycle innovation. A commitment to continuous innovation, based on customer need, ensures we actively work to broaden the value of existing products by developing claims in additional species, more convenient formulations, routes of administration and combinations, and by expanding usage into more countries. We also create opportunities by integrating product offerings to optimize solutions based on the totality of customer need.\nWe prioritize our R&D spending on an annual basis with the goal of aligning our research and business objectives, and do not disaggregate our R&D operations by research stage or by therapeutic area for purposes of managing our business. We make our strategic investments in R&D based on four criteria: strategic fit and importance to our current portfolio; technical feasibility of development and manufacture; return on investment; and the needs of customers and the market. A centralized portfolio management function links development plans with financial systems to build a comprehensive view of the status of project progression and spend. This view facilitates our ability to set targets for project timing and goals for investment efficiency. The allocation of our R&D investment between product lifecycle innovation and new product development, in addition to our ability to leverage the discoveries of our existing R&D and other industries, supports a cost-effective, efficient, sustainable and relatively predictable R&D process.\nWe regularly enter into agreements with external parties that enable us to collaborate on research programs or gain access to substrates and technologies (such as new devices). Some of our external partnerships involve funding from a non-governmental organization or a government grant. We are generally responsible for providing technical direction and supplemental expertise for, as well as investment in, such external partnerships. Depending on the nature of the agreement, we may act as the commercialization partner for discoveries that originate during the period of collaborative research, or we may own or have exclusive rights to any intellectual property that enables the development of proprietary products or models.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed approximately 1,600 employees in our global R&D operations. Our R&D headquarters is located in Kalamazoo, Michigan. We have R&D operations co-located with manufacturing sites in Rutherford, Australia; Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium; Campinas, Brazil; Suzhou, China; Farum, Denmark; Olot, Spain; and in the following U.S. locations: Union City, California; Charles City, Iowa; Kalamazoo, Michigan; Durham, North Carolina; and Lincoln, Nebraska. We co-locate R&D operations with manufacturing sites to facilitate the efficient transfer of production processes from our laboratories to manufacturing. In addition, we maintain R&D operations in Sydney, Australia; Zaventem, Belgium; Beijing, China; Puchheim, Germany; Thane, India; Oslo, Norway; Hong Ngu, Vietnam; Con Tho, Vietnam; Cambridge, U.K.; and Fort Collins, Colorado, U.S. Each site is designed to meet the regulatory requirements for working with chemical or infectious disease agents, as appropriate.\nManufacturing and Supply Chain \nOur products are manufactured at sites operated by us and sites operated by third-party contract manufacturing organizations, which we refer to as CMOs. We have a global manufacturing network of 22 sites operated by us.\nOur global manufacturing network is comprised of the following sites: \nSite                    Location                   Site              Location             \nBuellton                California, U.S.           Olot              Spain                \nCampinas                Brazil                     Overhalla         Norway               \nCatania                 Italy                      Rathdrum          Ireland              \nCharles City            Iowa, U.S.                 Rutherford        Australia            \nDurham                  North Carolina, U.S.       San Diego         California, U.S.     \nFarum                   Denmark                    Suzhou            China                \nKalamazoo               Michigan, U.S.             Tallaght          Ireland              \nKlofta                  Norway                     Tullamore         Ireland              \nLincoln                 Nebraska, U.S.             Union City        California, U.S.     \nLouvain-la-Neuve        Belgium                    Wellington        New Zealand          \nMelbourne               Australia                  White Hall        Illinois, U.S.       \nWe own the majority of these sites, with the exception of our facilities in Buellton, California (U.S.), Durham, North Carolina (U.S.), Klofta (Norway), Melbourne (Australia), San Diego, California (U.S.), and Union City, California (U.S.), which are leased sites. In addition, a portion of our facilities in Tullamore (Ireland) is leased. \n7 |\n\n\nWe regularly evaluate the adequacy of our manufacturing capabilities. We are currently in the process of expanding these capabilities at certain existing sites. Additionally, we purchased a manufacturing site outside Atlanta, Georgia in 2023, where we plan to begin commercial production in the future. In 2024, we ceased all operations at our Weibern, Austria site, and completed the divestiture of our medicated feed additive product portfolio, certain water soluble products and related assets, which included sites manufacturing those products in Chicago Heights, Illinois (U.S.); Eagle Grove, Iowa (U.S.); Medolla, Italy; Salisbury, Maryland (U.S.); Suzhou, China; and Willow Island, West Virginia (U.S.).\nOur global manufacturing and supply chain is supported by a network of CMOs. As of December 31, 2024, this network was comprised of over 110 CMOs, including those centrally-managed as well as locally-managed CMOs. \nWe select CMOs based on several factors: (i) their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost; (ii) their access to niche products and technologies; (iii) capacity; and (iv) financial efficiency analyses. Our regional and global manufacturing teams seek to ensure that all of the CMOs we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality. \nWe purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of third-party suppliers. We utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain, primarily for shipping and logistics support. \nWe intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization, including Six Sigma and Lean capabilities, which are processes intended to improve manufacturing efficiency. We have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at our global manufacturing network sites, and we regularly inspect and audit our global manufacturing network and CMO sites. \nCompetition \nAlthough our business is the largest based on revenue in the animal health industry (which includes medicines, vaccines and diagnostics), we face competition in the regions in which we compete. Principal drivers of competition vary depending on the particular region, species, product category and individual product, and include new product development, quality, price, service and promotion to veterinary professionals, pet owners and livestock producers. \nOur primary competitors include animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostic companies such as Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health Inc., the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc.; Elanco Animal Health; and IDEXX Laboratories. There are also several new start-up companies working in the animal health area. In addition, we compete with hundreds of other producers of animal health products throughout the world.\nThe level of competition from generic products varies from market to market. Unlike in the human health market, there is no large, well-capitalized company focused on generic animal health products that exists as a global competitor in the industry. Historically, the reasons for this include the relatively smaller average market size of each product opportunity, the importance of direct distribution and education to veterinarians and livestock producers and the primarily self-pay nature of the business. In addition, companion animal health products are often directly prescribed and dispensed by veterinarians. Nonetheless, we continue to face increased competition from generic products and lower cost alternatives. For more information regarding the generic competition we have and expect to encounter as patents on certain of our key products expire, see Item 1. Business - Intellectual Property.\nThe importance of quality and safety concerns to veterinarians, pet owners and livestock producers also contributes to animal health brand loyalty. As a result, we believe that significant brand loyalty to products often continues after the loss of patent-based and regulatory exclusivity. \nIntellectual Property \nOur technology, brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, design and trade secret laws, as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property, as appropriate. \nOur product portfolio enjoys the protection of approximately 5,500 granted patents and 1,450 pending patent applications, filed in more than 50 countries, with a focus on our major markets, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and the U.S., as well as other countries with strong patent systems. Many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our in-house research and development, while other patents and patent applications in our portfolio were wholly or partially developed by third parties and are licensed to Zoetis. \nPatents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing (or sometimes the date of patent grant) and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained. Below is a summary of our recent and upcoming key patent expirations.\n•Patents relating to the active ingredient (tulathromycin) and formulation of Draxxin have expired in the majority of markets. Exceptions are the formulation patent that expires in November 2025 in Japan, and formulation and active ingredient patents in Brazil which expire in July and December 2025, respectively. Generic or other competing tulathromycin products are now marketed in most major markets as well as in many smaller markets. Additional marketing authorizations for generic tulathromycin products may be granted in various markets in the future. Sales of Draxxin have been negatively affected by generic competition in the markets where the patents have expired.\n•All patents relating to the active ingredient of Excede/Naxcel (ceftiofur crystalline free acid) have expired. The patents covering the commercial formulation of Excede in Japan and Brazil extend to September 2026 and August 2027, respectively, but the corresponding patents in the U.S. expired in July 2024, and those in Europe, Canada and Australia expired in September 2021. Generic versions of Excede have entered the market in Brazil, Mexico and Russia. \n•The patent for the active ingredient of Cerenia has expired in all countries and the formulation patents relevant to the injectable product line expire between 2025 and 2028. Generic versions of Cerenia injectable have been registered and marketed in Europe, Canada and Australia and we are aware that regulatory approval of at least one generic version of Cerenia injectable is currently being pursued in the U.S. \nZoetis typically enforces its patents vigorously as appropriate globally, including by filing infringement claims against other parties.\n8 |\n\n\nAdditionally, many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by seeking to require our employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement.\nWe seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have, or desire to have, a business presence for a particular product or service. We currently maintain more than 10,500 trademark applications and registrations in our market countries, identifying products and services dedicated to the care of companion animals and livestock. \nRegulatory \nThe sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each jurisdiction in which we market our products. To maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes, systems, and dedicated resources with end-to-end involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market. Our regulatory function actively engages in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their requirements, policies, and guidance documents that relate to animal health products. \nUnited States \nUnited States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal health pharmaceuticals in the U.S. is the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), housed within the FDA. Generally, manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA's basis for approving an animal drug application is documented in a Freedom of Information (FOI) Summary. Post-approval monitoring of products is required by law, with reports being provided to CVM's Office of Surveillance and Compliance. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are submitted in accordance with the legal and agency requirements. \nCVM also has regulatory oversight of medical devices (including certain in vitro diagnostics) intended for animal use and can take appropriate regulatory action if an animal device is misbranded or adulterated. Importantly, however, CVM exercises enforcement discretion and does not require pre-market review of animal medical devices. Animal medical device labeling should not be false or misleading, and such products must be adequately labeled for their intended use(s). But, there is no specific FDA regulation reflecting such requirements at this time.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Abaxis, our product portfolio includes human medical devices, specifically human in vitro diagnostics, which are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing medical device regulations (21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter H), including the Quality System Regulation (to be replaced by the Quality Management System Regulation in 2026), and the Center for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS) under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and its implementing regulations (42 CFR Part 493). Post-market surveillance is required, with reports provided to the FDA in accordance with agency requirements.\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary biological products is the USDA. The USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics is responsible for the regulation of animal health vaccines, including certain immunotherapeutics and certain diagnostic products. In December 2024, the Center for Veterinary Biologics and CVM published a charter that details how the two agencies work together to determine the appropriate agency to regulate the small number of animal biologicals for which jurisdiction may be unclear. This is in addition to a 2013 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that outlines which animal biologicals each agency would regulate.\nManufacturers of animal health biological products must show their products to be pure, safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act (VSTA) and its implementing regulations (9 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter E). Post-license monitoring of products is required. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are submitted in accordance with the agency requirements. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA). The main regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary pesticides is the EPA. The EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied topically to animals. The EPA and FDA determine regulatory oversight of pesticides and animal drugs based on an MOU between the two agencies signed in 1971 and revised in 1973. In February 2023, the EPA and FDA released a whitepaper that outlined potential approaches for updating the agencies' oversight of such animal health products.\nCurrently, manufacturers of animal health pesticides must show their products, when used according to specifications, will not cause “unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment” as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and its implementing regulations. Within the U.S., pesticide products that are registered by the EPA (including review and approval of product labeling) must also be registered by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies. \nForeign Trade Controls. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.\nZoetis is also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain U.S. government agencies, including the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Commerce Department, Customs and Border Protection within the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). As a global animal health company, we conduct business in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world. This includes supplying medicines and medical products for use in Iran and shipment of products to Iran, and conducting related activities, in accordance with a general license issued by OFAC and in line with our corporate policies. As previously disclosed, we acquired Platinum Performance (Platinum) in August 2019. During the integration process, after the closing of the acquisition, we discovered that Platinum had initiated certain transactions involving sales of food, medicine or devices to individuals or entities who may have been resident in or had ties to Iran. These sales were not conducted pursuant to a general license from OFAC and potentially violated the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations (ITSR) administered by OFAC. We submitted an initial voluntary disclosure to OFAC in February 2020 while our internal investigation was ongoing. After concluding our internal investigation, in December 2020, we submitted a final voluntary disclosure to OFAC and the U.S. Department \n9 |\n\n\nof Justice regarding these transactions. In July 2023, OFAC provided a No Action letter confirming a final determination that no further action would be taken in the matter. We do not anticipate any further correspondence from the Department of Justice as the statutory response period has lapsed without a response. In addition, we are subject to a wide variety of state level regulations in the United States covering topics such as the environment, animal welfare and privacy.\nOutside the United States / Global\nEU. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is the centralized medicines regulatory agency of the EU. The agency is responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by healthcare companies seeking centralized approval for use in the EU. The agency has a distinct veterinary review section. The Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) is responsible for scientific and technical review of the submissions for innovative pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals and vaccines. After the CVMP issues a positive opinion on the approvability of a product, the EU commission reviews the opinion and, if they agree with the CVMP, they grant the product market authorization. Once granted by the European Commission, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU and European Economic Area-European Free Trade Association states. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as those developed by means of recombinant DNA technology or novel therapeutic veterinary medicinal products. Products (other than those covered by the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure) can also be registered in the EU via the decentralized or the mutual recognition routes under the supervision of the Co-ordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CMDv). This co-ordination group is composed of one representative per member state from each national regulatory agency, including Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. A series of Regulations (including the Veterinary Medicinal Products Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2019/6)), Directives, Guidelines and EU Pharmacopeia Monographs provide the requirements for product approval in the EU. In general, these requirements are similar to those in the U.S., requiring demonstrated evidence of, safety, efficacy, and quality/consistency of manufacturing processes. We are also subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that requires us to meet enhanced requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the rights of data subjects to request correction or deletion of their personal data.\nCurrently, there is no EU-specific Regulation regarding veterinary medical devices or veterinary in vitro diagnostics. In Europe, such animal health products are reviewed by national agencies based on national requirements, where such requirements exist.\nUnited Kingdom. The making, updating and enforcing of U.K. legislation for veterinary medicinal products is the responsibility of the U.K.’s Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD).\nChina. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), a ministerial-level component of the State Council, drafts and implements policies related to agriculture, rural areas and rural residents, and regulates crop farming, animal husbandry, fisheries, agriculture mechanization and the quality of agriculture products. MARA is also the regulatory body responsible for the regulation and supervision of pharmaceuticals and biologicals for animal use. Regulatory requirements in China have become increasingly stringent, with MARA recently issuing new regulations and changes to the regulatory review process.\nBrazil. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply (MAPA) is the regulatory body in Brazil that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicated feed additives for animal use. MAPA's regulatory activities are conducted through the Secretary of Agricultural Defense and its Livestock Products Inspection Department. In addition, regulatory activities are conducted at a local level through the Federal Agriculture Superintendence. These activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products, as well as the submission, review and approval of pharmaceuticals, biologicals, and medicated feed additives. MAPA is one of the most active regulatory agencies in Latin America, having permanent seats at several international animal health forums, such as Codex Alimentarius, World Organization for Animal Health and Committee of Veterinary Medicines for the Americas. MAPA was also invited to be a Latin American representative at meetings of the International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH). Several normative instructions issued by MAPA have set regulatory trends in Latin America. \nAustralia. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) is an Australian government statutory authority established in 1993 to centralize the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products for the Australian marketplace. Previously each State and Territory government had its own system of registration. The APVMA assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration or a permit so they can supply their product to the marketplace. Applications undergo rigorous assessment using the expertise of the APVMA's scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations, Commonwealth government departments and state agriculture departments. If the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people, animals, the environment or international trade, the APVMA will register the product. As well as registering new agricultural and veterinary products, the APVMA receives and reviews adverse event information which may be submitted by registrants or members of the public. The APVMA also reviews registered products when particular concerns are raised about their safety and effectiveness. The review of a product may result in confirmation of its registration, or it may see registration continue with some changes to the way the product can be used. In some cases the review may result in the registration of a product being canceled and the product taken off the market. \nRest of world. Jurisdiction-specific regulatory laws may have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling, safety, efficacy, and manufacturers' quality control procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports. In certain regions and jurisdictions, regulatory agencies may generally refer to the FDA, USDA, EU and other international animal health entities, including the World Organisation for Animal Health and Codex Alimentarius, in establishing standards or regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals, immunotherapies and vaccines. \nAdvertising and promotion review. Promotion of regulated animal health products is controlled by laws and regulations in many jurisdictions. These laws and rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those product claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable regulatory agency. We conduct a review of promotional materials for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products.\nData Privacy Laws. Our business involves the collection, use, and processing of personal data from our customers. The global privacy landscape is rapidly evolving, with countries where we operate introducing and enforcing new privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Compliance with \n10 |\n\n\nthese laws is costly, complex and requires continuous updates to our privacy practices, systems and policies. Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant fines, penalties and reputational damage, as well as restrictions on our ability to process personal data. \nWe collect and process personal information of our employees worldwide, which includes sensitive data such as health information, financial data and personal identifiers. We must comply with local labor and data protection laws concerning the privacy of employee information. In some jurisdictions, employee privacy protections are stricter, and any failure to comply with such laws could result in penalties, litigation or damage to our employer brand. Any changes to international data transfer mechanisms, including the invalidation of established frameworks or imposition of new restrictions, could disrupt our ability to transfer data and impede our business operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors--Risks related to legal matters and regulation--Our operations and reputation may be impacted if we do not comply with continually changing laws and regulations regarding data privacy.\nGlobal policy and guidance\nJoint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The JECFA provides a risk assessment/safety evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products, exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs. We work with them to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in food-producing animals after treatment. This in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain. \nInternational Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH). VICH is a trilateral (EU-Japan-USA) program aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration. The objectives of the VICH are as follows:\n•Establish and implement harmonized technical requirements for the registration of veterinary medicinal products in the VICH regions, which meet high quality, safety and efficacy standards and minimize the use of test animals and costs of product development.\n•Provide a basis for wider international harmonization of registration requirements through the VICH Outreach Forum.\n•Monitor and maintain existing VICH guidelines, taking particular note of the VICH work program and, where necessary, update these VICH guidelines.\n•Ensure efficient processes for maintaining and monitoring consistent interpretation of data requirements following the implementation of VICH guidelines.\n•By means of a constructive dialogue between regulatory authorities and industry, provide technical guidance enabling response to significant emerging global issues and science that impact on regulatory requirements within the VICH regions.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 13,800 employees worldwide, which included approximately 6,700 employees in the U.S. and approximately 7,100 in other jurisdictions. We view the strength of our leadership team and our talented colleagues around the world as critical components of our past and future success. We remain committed to being a company our colleagues can be proud of and one where they can thrive. We achieve this by attracting, retaining and developing the best talent in the industry through our focus on workplace culture and engagement, inclusion, talent recruitment, development and retention, benefits and compensation, and employee well-being, health and safety. The Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing talent development, employee engagement programs and policies, and the Quality and Innovation Committee regularly reviews employee health and safety metrics.\nSome of our employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in particular jurisdictions, including a small number of employees in the U.S.\nWorkplace Culture and Employee Engagement\nWe have established the following Core Beliefs that are the foundation of the commitments we make to each other, our customers and our stakeholders every day:\n•Our Colleagues Make the Difference\n•Always Do the Right Thing\n•Customer Obsessed\n•Run It Like You Own It\n•We are One Zoetis \nWe value responsibility and integrity. Our Code of Conduct contains general guidelines for conducting business with the highest ethical standards. We are committed to an environment where open, honest communications are the expectation, not the exception. We have an Open Door Policy where colleagues are encouraged to present ideas, concerns, questions, issues or suggestions directly to any level of leadership within Zoetis, without fear of retaliation.\nWe assess colleague engagement and key drivers enabling organizational performance by regularly conducting employee engagement surveys. Our engagement rate, as measured by favorable responses to qualitative questions about alignment with Zoetis objectives and employment with Zoetis, was 86% in 2024. We are proud to continue to have an engagement rate in the high eighties for the last five years. Insights from the Company’s engagement survey are used to develop both company-wide and business function level organizational and talent development plans.\n11 |\n\n\nWe strive to create an environment where colleagues feel valued and cared for, as well as understand the important role we play in embracing diverse perspectives to improve the quality of our innovation, collaboration and relationships. We offer nine Colleague Resource Groups, which are an important catalyst to fostering an inclusive environment, while positively impacting our business and community. \nTalent Recruitment, Development and Retention\nWe employ a variety of career development, employee benefits, policies and compensation programs designed to attract, develop and retain our colleagues. Employee benefits and policies are designed for a variety of needs including generous parental leave policies and expanded adoption, fertility and surrogacy benefits for all colleagues equitably. We have internal programs designed to develop and retain talent, including a talent development portal, mentoring programs, career planning resources, leadership development programs, and performance management and training programs. In particular, our R&D team recruits scientists and research and development personnel from universities and scientific associations and forums and leverages a variety of R&D-specific talent tools. Our global voluntary attrition rate remained stable at 8% in 2024.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe strive to support our colleagues’ well-being and enable them to achieve their best. Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to support colleague well-being including physical and mental health, financial wellness, and family and lifestyle resources. We recognize the needs of our colleagues around the world and have developed comprehensive programs that vary by country and region to best address them. In the U.S., these benefits include flexible work arrangements, educational assistance, mental health support, and inclusive family-friendly benefits like fully paid parental leave, including for adoptions, parents of all genders and same sex partners, as well as fertility and surrogacy benefits. To support colleague well-being and work life balance, we continue to offer enhanced childcare benefits and flexible work arrangements to aid our colleagues in managing their work and family responsibilities. \nWe are proud of our continuing record as a top employer, as recognized by esteemed publications and organizations around the world.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nWe are committed to ensuring a safe working environment for our employees and our Global Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Policy standards define EHS performance requirements for all sites, procedures and recommended practices. Our sites have injury prevention programs, and we strive to build a best-in-class safety culture. Our procedures emphasize the importance of investigating causes of injuries and action plans to be implemented to mitigate potential recurrence. \nWe track health and safety performance metrics including total injury rate (TIR), lost time injury rate (LTIR), restricted work injuries and medical treatment injuries on a monthly basis for all manufacturing and research and development sites, as well as for U.S. offices, field force, fleet and logistics. Since 2018, we have tracked TIR and LTIR for all our operations worldwide. Our safety programs have resulted in strong safety performance, with TIR and LTIR rates being lower than the industry averages. \nInformation about our Executive Officers\nKristin C.

These laws and regulations govern matters such as the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; the generation, use, storage, handling, treatment, packaging, transportation, exposure to, and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, including recordkeeping, reporting and registration \n13 |\n\n\nrequirements; and the health and safety of our employees. Due to our operations, these laws and regulations also require us to obtain, and comply with, permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke our permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions. \nCertain environmental laws, such as the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on persons who disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment, including at third-party sites or offsite disposal locations, or those who currently own or operate (or formerly owned or operated) sites where such a release occurred. In addition to clean-up actions brought by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities, private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous materials on, from or otherwise relating to such a property. \nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We are also a party to proceedings in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation, or remedial measures to mitigate or remediate pollution. In connection with such proceedings, and otherwise, we are investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites, or financing other parties' completion of such activities. As a result, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2024 for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activities as follows:\n•environmental-related capital expenditures - approximately $5 million; and\n•other environmental-related expenditures - approximately $23 million.\nHowever, we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities relating to our current and former properties, or those liabilities associated with off-site disposal locations. Such liability could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, regulatory agencies are showing increasing concern over the impact of animal health products and livestock operations on the environment. This increased regulatory scrutiny may necessitate that additional time and resources be spent to address these concerns in both new and existing products. \nIn connection with past acquisitions and divestitures, we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us, or may require us in the future, to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites that we no longer own or operate. We have also entered into indemnification agreements in which we are being indemnified for various environmental cleanups; however, such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information, or may not be available at all. \nWhile we cannot predict with certainty our future capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance or remediation of contaminated sites, we currently have no reason to believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nAvailable Information\nThe company's internet website address is www.zoetis.com.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this 2024 Annual Report, any of the factors described below could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity, which could cause the trading price of our securities to decline.\nThis report contains “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and performance. We generally identify forward-looking statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “project,” “plan,” “predict,” “believe,” “seek,” “continue,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “objective,” “target,” “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “can have,” “likely” or the negative version of these words or comparable words or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of future performance, actions or events. Forward-looking statements are based on beliefs and assumptions made by management using currently available information. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, actions or events.\nIn particular, forward-looking statements include statements relating to our future actions, business plans or prospects, prospective products, product approvals or products under development, product and supply chain disruptions, R&D costs, timing and likelihood of success, future operating or financial performance, future results of current and anticipated products and services, strategies, sales efforts, expenses, production efficiencies, production margins, anticipated timing of generic market entries, integration of acquired businesses, anticipated impact or timing of divestitures, interest rates, tax rates, tariffs, changes in tax regimes and laws, foreign exchange rates, growth in emerging markets, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, plans related to share repurchases and dividends, government regulation, taxes and financial results. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and potentially inaccurate assumptions. However, there may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if management's underlying beliefs and assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by a forward-looking statement. You should not put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made.\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q and 8-K reports and our other filings with the SEC. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.\nRisks related to our business and the animal health industry\nThe animal health industry is highly competitive.\nWe believe many of our competitors are conducting R&D activities in areas served by our products and in areas in which we are developing products. Our competitors include standalone animal health businesses, start-up companies working in the animal health area and the animal health businesses of large pharmaceutical companies. These competitors may have access to greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources or have significant market share in particular areas. As a result, they may be able to devote more resources to researching, developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling their products, initiating or withstanding substantial price competition or more readily taking advantage of acquisitions, collaborations or other opportunities. In recent years, there has been an increase in consolidation in the animal health industry, which could result in existing competitors realizing additional efficiencies or improving portfolio bundling opportunities, thereby potentially increasing their market share and pricing power, which could lead to an increase in competition and a decrease in our revenue and profitability. We also face competition from lower-priced generic alternatives to our products that no longer have patent protection. See \"--Generic and other products may be viewed as more cost-effective than our products.\"\nTo the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor or we are forced to reduce, or are unable to raise, the price of any of our products in order to remain competitive, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \nOur results of operations are dependent upon the success of our top-selling products.\nIf any of our top-selling products or product lines experience issues, such as loss of patent protection, material product liability litigation, new or unexpected side effects (or an increased frequency of serious, expected adverse events), manufacturing or supply chain disruptions, regulatory proceedings or enforcement, labeling changes, public regulatory communications, negative publicity or social media attention, changes to veterinarian or customer preferences, and/or disruptive innovations or the introduction of competing and/or more effective products, our revenues could be negatively impacted, perhaps significantly. For example, our five top-selling products and product lines, Simparica/Simparica Trio, Apoquel/Apoquel Chewable, Cytopoint, Librela and our ceftiofur line, contributed approximately 41% of our revenue in 2024, and certain issues with these top-selling products and product lines could have a more significant impact to our results of operations.\nOur products are subject to unanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns.\nUnanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to our products, whether or not scientifically or clinically supported, which can lead to product recalls, label changes, public regulatory communications, negative publicity or social media attention, withdrawals or suspended or declining sales, as well as product liability and other claims. \nRegulatory actions based on these types of safety, quality or efficacy concerns could impact all or a significant portion of a product’s sales and could, depending on the circumstances, materially adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety, quality and efficacy of our products, and animal health products generally, by our customers, veterinarians and end-users, any concerns as to the safety, quality or efficacy of our products, whether actual or perceived, may harm our reputation or materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, regardless of whether such concerns are accurate.\n15 |\n\n\nOur business is subject to risk based on global economic and political conditions.\nMacroeconomic, business, political and financial disruptions, including public health crises or pandemics, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Certain of our customers and suppliers may be affected directly by economic downturns and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from customers or goods from our suppliers. If one or more of our large customers, including distributors, discontinue their relationship with us as a result of economic conditions, public health conditions, sanctions or otherwise, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In addition, economic concerns and geopolitical instability may cause shortages in veterinary healthcare workers or some pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet. Moreover, customers may seek lower price alternatives to our products if they are negatively impacted by the current poor economic conditions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the regional conflict in the Middle East, economic weakness in China, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as inflation, are examples of recent global economic conditions that could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. \nInfectious disease outbreaks, pandemics, sanctions, geopolitical instability and widespread fear of spreading disease through human contact can cause disruptions to or negatively impact our customers’, our suppliers’ and our distributors’ business operations, which could materially adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our exposure to credit and collectability risk and cybersecurity risk is higher in certain international markets, our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk and have defensive measures in place to prevent and mitigate cyberattacks, there can be no assurances that such procedures and measures will effectively limit such risks and avoid losses.\nGeneric and other products may be viewed as more cost-effective than our products.\nWe face competition from products produced by other companies, including generic alternatives to our products. We depend on patents and regulatory data exclusivity periods to provide us with exclusive marketing rights for some of our products. Patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing (or sometimes the date of patent grant) and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained. The extent of protection afforded by our patents varies from country to country and is limited by the scope of the claimed subject matter of our patents, the term of the patent and the availability and enforcement of legal remedies in the applicable country and potential legislative or regulatory changes to the underlying patent framework. As a result, we face competition from lower-priced generic alternatives to many of our products that no longer have patent protection. In certain circumstances, we have been forced to lower our prices and provide discounts or rebates in order to compete with generic products. Generic competitors are becoming more aggressive in terms of launching at risk before patent rights expire and, because of their pricing, are an increasing percentage of overall animal health sales in certain regions. For example, several companies have launched generic versions of our Rimadyl chewable and Draxxin products. In the years since the start of generic and other competition, sales of our Rimadyl chewable and Draxxin products have declined in the U.S., the largest market for these products, by 40% and 49%, respectively.\nIf animal health customers increase their use of new or existing generic products, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \nConsolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products.\nVeterinarians and livestock producers are our primary customers. In recent years, there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals. In addition, livestock producers, particularly swine and poultry producers, and our distributors, have seen consolidation in their industries. Furthermore, we have seen the expansion of larger cross-border corporate customers and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups (cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers). If these trends continue, these customers and distributors could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing. The resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in distribution channels for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share, margins and distribution of our products.\nIn most markets, companion animal owners typically purchase their animal health products directly from veterinarians. Companion animal owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal health products and, in some cases, veterinary services from sources other than veterinarians, such as internet-based retailers, “big-box” retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. Companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on veterinarians as they rely more on internet-based animal health information. Because we primarily market our companion animal products through the veterinarian distribution channel, any decrease in reliance on veterinarians by companion animal owners could reduce our market share for such products and materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal health products if human health products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.\nIn the U.S. and certain other markets, these and other competitive conditions have increased, and may continue to increase, our reliance on internet-based retailers, “big-box” retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels to sell our companion animal products. Over time we may be unable to sustain our current margins due to the increased purchasing power of such retailers as compared to traditional veterinary practices. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAn outbreak of infectious disease carried by animals could negatively affect the sale and production of our products.\nSales of our livestock products could be materially adversely affected by the outbreak of disease carried by animals, which could lead to the widespread death or precautionary destruction of animals as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animal protein. In addition, outbreaks of disease carried by animals may reduce regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of such products, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, which may reduce demand for our products due to reduced herd or flock sizes. In recent years, outbreaks of various diseases, including African Swine Fever, avian influenza and highly pathogenic avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (otherwise known as BSE or mad cow disease) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (otherwise known as PEDv), have impacted the animal health business. The discovery of additional or more severe cases of any of these, or new diseases may \n16 |\n\n\nresult in additional restrictions on animal proteins, reduced herd sizes, or reduced demand for animal protein, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious disease near our main production sites could require us to immediately halt production of our products at such sites or force us to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere.\nDisruptive innovations and advances in medical practices and technologies could negatively affect the market for our products.\nThe market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction and/or broad market acceptance of newly-developed or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products, including “green” or “holistic” health products or specially bred disease-resistant animals. In addition, technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products. Introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nImplementing new business lines or offering new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new business lines or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There may be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. We may invest significant time and resources in researching, developing, marketing, or acquiring new lines of business and/or offering new products and services. Initial timetables for the introduction and development or acquisition of new lines of business and/or the offering of new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may prove to be unachievable. Our lack of experience or knowledge, as well as external factors, such as compliance with new or evolving regulations, legislative changes, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the success of an acquisition or the implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. New business lines or new products and services within existing lines of business could affect the sales and profitability of existing lines of business or products and services. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the implementation or acquisition of new lines of business or the offering of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRestrictions and bans on the use of and/or consumer preferences regarding antibacterials in food-producing animals may become more prevalent.\nThe issue of the potential transfer of increased antibacterial resistance in bacteria from food-producing animals to human pathogens, and the causality of that transfer, continue to be the subject of global scientific and regulatory discussion. In some countries, this issue has led to government restrictions and bans on the use of specific antibacterials in some food-producing animals. These restrictions are more prevalent in countries where animal protein is plentiful and governments are willing to take action even when there is scientific uncertainty. Our total revenue attributable to antibacterials for livestock was approximately $950 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As a result of the divestiture of our medicated feed additive product portfolio, certain water soluble products and related assets, we anticipate our total revenues attributable to antibacterials for livestock will decrease.\nFor example, regulations regarding antibiotic usage in animals have been introduced in several markets, including the U.S., the EU, the U.K., China and Vietnam. In addition, certain jurisdictions like Italy have implemented the use of electronic prescriptions, which has caused more disciplined use of antibiotics and decreased the demand for our antibacterial products. Also, in certain markets, there has been an increase in consumer preference towards proteins produced without the use of antibiotics.\nWe cannot predict whether antibacterial resistance concerns will result in additional restrictions or bans, expanded regulations, public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in food-producing animals or increased consumer preference for antibiotic-free protein, any of which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nPerceived adverse effects linked to the consumption of food derived from animals that utilize our products or animals generally could cause a decline in the sales of such products.\nOur livestock business depends heavily on a healthy and growing livestock industry. If the public perceives a risk to human health from the consumption of the food derived from animals that utilize our products, there may be a decline in the production of such food products and, in turn, demand for our products. Furthermore, changing consumer preferences and increasing consumer interest in alternatives to animal-based protein and dairy products has driven the growth of plant-based substitutes. Any reputational harm to the livestock industry may also extend to companies in related industries, including our company. Adverse consumer views related to the use of one or more of our products, including vaccines, in livestock also may result in a decrease in the use of such products and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIncreased regulation or decreased governmental financial support relating to the raising, processing or consumption of food-producing animals could reduce demand for our livestock products.\nCompanies in the livestock industries are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations. If livestock producers are adversely affected by new regulations or changes to existing regulations, they may reduce herd sizes or become less profitable and, as a result, they may reduce their use of our products, which may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Also, many food-producing companies, including livestock producers, benefit from governmental subsidies, and if such subsidies were to be reduced or eliminated, these companies may become less profitable and, as a result, may reduce their use of our products. Furthermore, new or more stringent regulations could, directly or indirectly, impact the use of one or more of our products. More stringent regulation of the livestock industry or our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. \nWe may not successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form and manage alliances or divest businesses.\nWe pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, strategic alliances or divestitures of some of our businesses as part of our business strategy. We may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, due to regulatory constraints or limitations or other unforeseen factors that prevent us from realizing the expected benefits. We may be unable to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we may be unable to achieve expected sales, gross margin improvements or efficiencies. We may be subject to litigation or government investigations in connection with, or as a result of, acquisitions, dispositions, licenses or other alliances. While our evaluation of any \n17 |\n\n\npotential transaction includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions or fines resulting from an acquisition target's previous activities, inadequate controls, or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target’s legacy products. Any of these events could cause us to incur significant expenses and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nModification of foreign trade policy by the U.S. or other countries or the imposition of tariffs on imported goods may harm our business.\nChanges in trade laws, agreements and policies governing trade in and out of the territories and countries where our customers do business could negatively impact such customers’ businesses and adversely affect our operating results. A number of our customers, particularly U.S.-based livestock producers, benefit from free trade agreements. As well, international trade agreements or policies could harm our business and customers, and, as a result, negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, in response to U.S. tariffs affecting exports, some governments, including China, have instituted and may in the future institute tariffs on certain U.S. goods. While the scope and duration of these and any future tariffs remains uncertain, tariffs imposed by the U.S. or other governments on our products or the active pharmaceutical ingredients or other components thereof could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be negatively affected by weather conditions, natural disasters and the availability of natural resources.\nAdverse weather events and natural disasters may interfere with and negatively impact operations at our manufacturing sites, research and development facilities and office buildings, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, especially if such interruptions to regular operations are frequent or prolonged.\nWeather conditions, including excessive cold or heat, natural disasters, floods, droughts and other events, could negatively impact our livestock customers by impairing the health or growth of their animals or the production or availability of feed. Such events could also interfere with our livestock customers’ operations due to power outages, fuel shortages, damage to their farms or facilities or disruption of transportation channels, among other things. In the event of a natural disaster, adverse weather conditions, or a shortage of fresh water, veterinarians or livestock producers may purchase less of our products and our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, veterinary hospitals and practitioners depend on visits from and access to animals under their care. Veterinarians’ patient volume and ability to operate could be adversely affected if they experience natural disasters or adverse weather conditions, including floods, fires, earthquakes and hurricanes or other storms, or prolonged snow or ice, particularly in regions not accustomed to sustained inclement weather.\nClimate change could have a material adverse impact on our and our customers’ businesses.\nWe operate in many regions, countries and communities around the world where our businesses, our activities and the activities of our customers and suppliers, could be disrupted by climate change. Potential physical risks from climate change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency of wildfires and other natural disasters, rising sea levels, and a rising heat index, any of which could cause negative impacts to our and our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses. The physical changes caused by climate change may also prompt changes in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for our and our customers’ businesses. Climate change may negatively impact our customers’ operations, particularly those in the livestock industry, through climate-related impacts such as increased air and water temperatures, rising water levels and increased incidence of disease in livestock. In addition, concerns regarding greenhouse gas emissions and other potential environmental impacts from livestock production have led to some consumers opting to limit or avoid consuming animal products. If such events affect our customers’ businesses, they may purchase fewer Zoetis products, and our revenues may be negatively impacted. Such climate driven changes could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our business, and on our customers. \nThe impacts from climate change may also impact Zoetis’ and our suppliers’ manufacturing processes. For example, ample amounts of clean water are needed to produce our products, and the effects from climate change could result in water supply interruptions and low water quality. In addition, increased frequency of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions as a result of climate change may disrupt our manufacturing processes or our supply chain. These disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customer income.\nConcerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to alter their treatment recommendation in favor of lower-cost alternatives to our products. Also, feed, fuel and transportation and other key costs for livestock producers may increase or animal protein prices or sales may decrease. These trends could result in a decrease in sales of our companion animal products, especially in developed countries where there is a higher rate of pet ownership, inhibit our livestock product customers from paying us for products delivered or reduce spending on our products.\nOur business may be harmed if we are unable to retain and hire executive officers or other key personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel, including research, technical, sales, security, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location and work environment. From time to time there may be shortages of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees or lead to increased labor costs. In addition, we generally do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key personnel. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees, we may not be able to maintain or expand our operations, or our business could be otherwise adversely affected and could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by labor disputes, strikes or work stoppages.\nSome of our employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the risk of labor disputes, strikes, work stoppages and other labor-relations matters. We may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on similar or more favorable terms and may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future at our sites. We could experience a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, which \n18 |\n\n\ncould have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced revenue and net income. We may also experience difficulty or delays in implementing changes to our workforce in certain markets. In addition, labor problems at our suppliers, CMOs or other service providers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be required to write down goodwill or identifiable intangible assets.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), if we determine goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down these assets and record a non-cash impairment charge. As of December 31, 2024, we had goodwill of $2.7 billion and identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization, of $1.1 billion. Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of developed technology rights, brands, trademarks, license agreements, patents, acquired customer relationships and in-process R&D.\nDetermining whether an impairment exists and the amount of the potential impairment involves quantitative data and qualitative criteria that are based on estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment. Future events or new information may change management's valuation of an intangible asset in a short amount of time. The timing and amount of impairment charges recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income and write-downs recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets could vary if management's conclusions change. Any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nRisks related to manufacturing and supply\nManufacturing problems and capacity imbalances may cause product launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls or unanticipated costs.\nIn order to sell our products, we must be able to produce and ship our products in sufficient quantities. On December 31, 2024, we had a global manufacturing network consisting of 22 manufacturing sites located in 11 countries. We also employ a network of over 110 third-party CMOs. Many of our products involve complex manufacturing processes and are sole-sourced from certain manufacturing sites.\nMinor deviations in our or our suppliers' manufacturing or logistical processes, such as temperature excursions or improper package sealing, could result in delays, inventory shortages, unanticipated costs, product recalls, product liability and/or regulatory action. In addition, a number of factors could cause production interruptions, including:\n•the failure of us or any of our vendors or suppliers, including logistical service providers, to comply with applicable regulations and quality assurance guidelines, including any changes to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP);\n•the failure to accurately forecast demand for our products;\n•mislabeling;\n•construction delays;\n•equipment malfunctions;\n•shortages of materials;\n•labor problems, including any pandemic-related impacts; \n•delays in receiving any required governmental authorizations or regulatory approvals, including as a result of any prolonged shutdown of the U.S. government;\n•natural disasters and adverse weather conditions;\n•power outages;\n•criminal and terrorist activities;\n•changes in manufacturing production sites and limits to manufacturing capacity due to regulatory requirements, changes in types of products produced, shipping distributions or physical limitations; and\n•the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases at or near our production sites.\nThese interruptions could result in launch delays, inventory shortages, recalls, unanticipated costs or issues with our agreements under which we supply third parties, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic we experienced challenges in manufacturing certain products including Simparica Trio, and the component parts of certain products including Librela and Solensia, that have impacted our ability to meet customer demand. As a result, we had to take certain measures including placing limits on the amounts of product veterinarians could purchase and delayed the launch of the product in certain markets. \nOur manufacturing network, including our CMOs, may be unable to meet the demand for our products or we may have excess capacity if demand for our products changes. The unpredictability of a product's regulatory or commercial success or failure, the lead time necessary to construct highly technical and complex manufacturing sites, and shifting customer demand (including as a result of market conditions or entry of branded or generic competition) increase the potential for capacity imbalances. In addition, construction of sites is expensive, and our ability to recover costs will depend on the market acceptance and success of the products produced at the new sites, which is uncertain.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with products, materials and services, and are subject to increased labor and material costs and potential disruptions in supply.\nThe materials used to manufacture our products may be subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by changes in demand, weather conditions, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other factors. In addition, labor costs may be subject to volatility caused by the supply of labor, governmental regulations, economic climate and other factors. Increases in the demand for, availability or the price of, materials used to manufacture our products and increases in labor costs could increase the costs to manufacture our products, result in product delivery delays or shortages, and impact our ability to launch new products on a timely basis or at all. We may not be able to pass all or a material portion of any higher product, material, transportation or labor costs on to our customers, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n19 |\n\n\nCertain third-party suppliers are the sole or exclusive source of certain products, materials and services necessary for production of our products. We may be unable to meet demand for certain of our products if any of our third-party suppliers cease or interrupt operations, fail to renew contracts with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations to us.\nThere may be delays and additional costs due to changes to our existing manufacturing facilities and the construction of new manufacturing plants.\nAs part of our supply network strategy, we have invested and will continue to invest in improvements to our existing manufacturing facilities and in new manufacturing plants. In addition, certain of our existing manufacturing facilities are in the process of being upgraded. These types of projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, and require licensure and/or inspection by various regulatory authorities. Significant cost overruns or delays in completing these projects could have an adverse effect on our return on investment.\nRisks related to our research and development\nOur R&D, acquisition and licensing efforts may fail to generate new products and product lifecycle innovations.\nOur future success depends on both our existing product portfolio and our pipeline of new products, including new products that we may develop through joint ventures and products that we are able to obtain through license or acquisition. We commit substantial effort, funds and other resources to R&D, both through our own dedicated resources and through collaborations with third parties.\nWe may be unable to determine with accuracy when or whether any of our products now under development will be approved or launched, or we may be unable to develop, license or otherwise acquire product candidates or products. In addition, we cannot predict whether any products, once launched, will be commercially successful or will achieve sales and revenue that are consistent with our expectations. The animal health industry is subject to regional and local trends and regulations and, as a result, products that are successful in some of our markets may not achieve similar success when introduced into new markets. Furthermore, the timing and cost of our R&D may increase, and our R&D may become less predictable. If we are unable to generate new products or expand the use of our existing products, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nNew product R&D leverages discoveries of pharmaceutical and biotechnology R&D. We have and expect to continue to enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties to provide us with access to molecules, compounds and other technology for purposes of our business. Such agreements are typically complex and require time to negotiate and implement. If we enter into these arrangements, we may not be able to maintain these relationships or establish new ones in the future on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, any collaboration that we enter into may not be successful, and the success may depend on the efforts and actions of our collaborators, which we may not be able to control. If we are unable to access these technologies to conduct R&D on cost-effective terms, our ability to develop some types of new products could be limited.\nWe may experience difficulties or delays in the development and commercialization of new products.\nNew products may appear promising in development but fail to reach the market within the expected or optimal timeframe, or at all. In addition, product extensions or additional indications may not be approved by government regulators. Developing and commercializing new products subjects us to inherent risks and uncertainties, including (i) delayed or denied regulatory approvals or label changes, (ii) delays or challenges with producing products in accordance with regulatory requirements, on a commercial scale and at a reasonable cost; (iii) failure to accurately predict the market for new products; and (iv) efficacy, quality and safety concerns. In addition, a failure to continue to identify and develop products, both internally and through external sources, could impact our future success. Once necessary regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial success of any new product depends upon, among other things, its acceptance by veterinarians and end customers, and on our ability to successfully manufacture, market, and distribute products in sufficient quantities to meet actual demand. The inability to successfully bring a product to market could negatively impact our revenues and earnings.\nOur R&D relies on evaluations in animals, which may become subject to bans or additional restrictive regulations.\nThe evaluation of our existing and new medicines and vaccines for animals is required in order to develop and commercialize them. Animal testing in certain countries and states has been the subject of increased regulation, controversy and adverse publicity. Our licenses or permits for animal testing could be revoked or put on hold due to animal welfare events that may occur. Some organizations and individuals have attempted to ban animal testing or encourage the adoption of additional regulations applicable to animal testing and animal welfare. To the extent that the activities of such organizations and individuals are successful, our R&D, and by extension our operating results and financial condition, could be materially adversely affected. In addition, negative publicity about us or our industry could impact R&D projected timelines or harm our reputation or the reputation of our contract research organizations.\nRisks related to legal matters and regulation\nOur business is subject to substantial regulation.\nAs a global company, we are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations, including regulations relating to the research, development, quality assurance, manufacturing, importation, exportation, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, including our in vitro diagnostic products used in human health. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, the USDA and foreign equivalents. Our failure, or the failure of third parties we rely on, including CMOs, to comply with these regulatory requirements, allegations of such non-compliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in, among other things, inspectional observation notices, label changes, untitled or warning letters or other public regulatory communications or correspondence, fines, a partial or total shutdown of production in one or more of our facilities while an alleged violation is remediated, withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market, product seizures, injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims. Any one of these consequences could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we will not be able to market new products unless and until we have obtained all required regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction where \n20 |\n\n\nwe propose to market those products. Even after a product reaches market, it may be subject to re-review and may lose its approvals. We have changed, and may in the future change, the locations of where certain of our products are manufactured and, because of these changes, we may be required to obtain new regulatory approvals. Our failure to obtain approvals, delays in the approval process, including any delays resulting from any prolonged shutdown of the U.S. government, or our failure to maintain approvals in any jurisdiction, may prevent us from selling products in that jurisdiction until approval or reapproval is obtained, if ever.\nThe OFAC at the U.S. Treasury Department and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), and similar agencies in other countries and territories outside the U.S., administer certain laws and regulations that restrict its persons and, in some instances, extraterritorial persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to economic sanctions. Our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities, and individuals, and are constantly changing. For example, we sell limited humanitarian animal health products, including medicines, diagnostics and vaccines, to Russia and Iran, in compliance with economic sanctions affecting these countries. Violations of sanctions regulations may be punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees and agents. For example, in December 2020, we submitted a final voluntary disclosure to OFAC and the U.S. Department of Justice regarding certain transactions involving sales of food, medicine or devices to individuals or entities who may have been resident in or had ties to Iran potentially in violation of the ITSR administered by OFAC. The sales were made by our Platinum Performance business, which we acquired in August 2019. In July 2023, OFAC provided a No Action letter confirming a final determination that no further action would be taken in the matter. We do not anticipate further communication from the Department of Justice as the statutory response period has lapsed without a response.\nA failure to comply with the environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject, including any permits issued thereunder, may result in environmental remediation costs, loss of permits, fines, penalties or other adverse governmental or private actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or remedial measures. We cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental, health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous materials will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. \nThere has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state, national and international regulation aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. Such regulations apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or could have interests in the future. The EU adopted the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) that will require disclosure by EU entities, including certain EU subsidiaries of non-EU entities, regarding the risks and opportunities arising from environmental, social and corporate governance issues, and on the impact of companies' activities on people and the environment. Similarly, the State of California passed the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act that imposes broad climate-related disclosure obligations on certain companies doing business in California, including us. Any new regulation could take several forms that could result in additional costs in the form of investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations and taxes. Climate change regulation continues to evolve, and it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation.\nWe are also subject to chemical regulation in the United States and internationally. For example, governmental authorities in the EU and the United States are increasingly focused on preventing environmental contamination from per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which may be contained in certain of our products. Federal and state governments and regulatory agencies, like the European Chemicals Agency, are in various stages of considering and/or implementing laws and regulations requiring the reporting, restriction and/or phase-out of PFAS products (subject to applicable product exceptions).\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, or changes in tax laws and tariffs, nor can we determine the effect that additional laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could have on our business when and if promulgated. Changes in applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may incur substantial costs and receive adverse outcomes in litigation and/or other legal matters.\nOur operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by unfavorable results in pending or future litigation matters. In addition, changes in the interpretations of laws and regulations to which we are subject, or in legal standards in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could increase our exposure to liability. For example, in the U.S., attempts have been made to allow damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering in connection with the loss of, or injury to, a companion animal. If such attempts were successful, our exposure with respect to product liability claims could increase materially. We also sell certain in vitro diagnostic products used in human health that could increase the scope of our liability.\nLitigation matters, regardless of their merits or their ultimate outcomes, are costly, divert management's attention and may materially adversely affect our reputation and demand for our products. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of pending or future litigation matters. An adverse outcome of litigation or legal matters could result in our being responsible for significant damages. Any of these negative effects resulting from litigation matters could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products or of stolen, diverted or relabeled products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nThird parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or illegally compounded versions of our products that do not meet the exacting standards of our development, manufacturing and distribution processes. Counterfeit or illegally compounded medicines pose a significant risk to animal health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured and the lack of regulation of their contents. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or illegally compounded products which are alleged to be equivalent and/or which are sold under our brand name. We are aware of at least one pharmacy in Brazil that may be engaged in the practice of illegally compounding oclacitinib, the active \n21 |\n\n\npharmaceutical ingredient in our Apoquel product. We are also aware of some counterfeit versions of our Simparica and Apoquel products in Brazil and are coordinating with the local authorities. In addition, products stolen or unlawfully diverted from inventory, warehouses, plants or while in transit, which are not properly stored or which have an expired shelf life and which have been repackaged or relabeled and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact animal health and safety, our reputation and our business. Public loss of confidence in the integrity of vaccines and/or pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting, illegally compounding or theft could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial or other damages.\nOur products have been approved for use under specific circumstances for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions in specific species. There may be increased risk of product liability claims and other liability if veterinarians, livestock producers, pet owners or others attempt to use our products off-label, including the use of our products in species (including humans) for which they have not been approved. In addition, certain of our products are regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration as controlled substances because of their potential to be misused or abused by humans, which could expose us to liability. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those indications for which our products have been approved may not be effective, which could harm our reputation and lead to an increased risk of litigation. If we are deemed by a governmental or regulatory agency to have engaged in the promotion of any of our products for off-label use, such agency could request that we modify our training or promotional materials and practices and we could be subject to significant fines and penalties, and the imposition of these sanctions could also affect our reputation and position within the industry. Additionally, if we fail to maintain effective controls against diversion of our products that are classified as controlled substances, we could be subject to significant fines and penalties as well as reputational damage. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations and reputation may be impacted if we do not comply with continually changing laws and regulations regarding data privacy.\nWe collect and use personal data of our customers, employees and suppliers, including health information in our human health business, in a variety of ways. In addition, we have been investing in data and digital capabilities and have expanded our diagnostics portfolio. Our customers, employees and suppliers expect that we will adequately protect their data.\nOur collection, use, retention, storage, and sharing of personal data is subject to a variety of data privacy laws and regulations in the United States and other regions where we operate. The legal environment surrounding data privacy is demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing regulatory requirements.\nAs a global company, we are faced with the challenge of how to manage a patchwork of laws, rules, regulations and industry standards, including, but not limited to, a growing number of U.S state privacy laws, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, the U.K.'s General Data Protection Regulation, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law, China’s Personal Information Protection Law and India's Digital Personal data Protection (DPDP) Act. These laws and regulations vary across countries, are complex and can be subject to significant change. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant consequences for Zoetis. This includes substantial fines and penalties, regulatory investigations, and civil lawsuits with damages, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business. In addition, with the growing number of new privacy laws and regulatory requirement, the costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future.\nOur aspirations, goals and disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters expose us to numerous risks, including risks to our reputation.\nOur Driven to Care sustainability program includes various ESG aspirations and goals. These goal statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately report on these goals and objectives present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material negative impact, including on our reputation. Our ability to achieve any goal or objective is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (i) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (ii) evolving regulatory requirements and rulings affecting ESG and diversity standards or disclosures, (iii) our ability to recruit, develop and retain talent in our labor markets, (iv) the impact of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations and (v) potential negative publicity from diversity and inclusion matters. \nThe standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters and continue to evolve. Our processes and controls may not always align with evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards that may be required by the SEC, EU and other regulators may differ from those of others and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. If our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner or acquirer could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could also have similar negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\nRisks related to information technology\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our information technology systems from cyberattacks, breaches of security or misappropriation of data, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and subject us to significant financial and legal exposure.\nOur reputation as a global leader in animal health and our reliance on complex information systems and digital solutions make us inherently vulnerable to malicious cyber intrusion and attack. In addition, we have been investing in data and digital capabilities, including incorporating the use of certain AI capabilities into the development of new technologies and products, and have expanded our diagnostics portfolio, and as a result, there could be an increased likelihood of a cyberattack or breach of security that could negatively impact us or our customers. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyberattacks could include wrongful conduct by hostile foreign governments, industrial espionage, the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, and other means to \n22 |\n\n\nthreaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. In addition, despite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we (or our third party partners) may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information (including confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property and corporate strategic plans), defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. \nIn support of our flexible work environment, many of our workforce work either part-time or full-time remotely, which could increase risks associated with cybersecurity, information technology and systems which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe costs imposed on us as a result of a cyberattack or network disruption could be significant. Among others, such costs could include increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures, litigation, regulatory investigations, fines, and sanctions, lost revenues from business interruption, damage to the public’s perception regarding our ability to keep our information secure and significant remediation costs. As a result, a cyberattack or network disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe depend on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems to manage our operations, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our personnel, customers and suppliers around the world. System failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business, hurt our relationships with our customers, or delay our financial reporting. Such failures could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we depend on third parties and applications on virtualized (cloud) infrastructure to operate and support our information systems. These third parties include large established vendors, as well as many small, privately owned companies. Failure by these providers to adequately support our operations or a change in control or insolvency of these providers could have an adverse effect on our business, which in turn may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to successfully manage our online ordering sites.\nIn many markets around the world, such as the U.S. and Brazil, we provide online ordering sites to customers, often relying on third parties to host and support the application. The operation of our online business depends on our ability to maintain the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our online order-taking and fulfillment operations. Problems in any one or more of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition and could damage our reputation.\nRisks related to operating in foreign jurisdictions \nA significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions, including jurisdictions presenting a high risk of bribery and corruption, and are subject to the economic, political, legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business.\nOur international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following:\n•volatility in the international financial markets;\n•difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\n•theft or compromise of technology, data and intellectual property;\n•parallel trade in our products (importation of our products from EU countries where our products are sold at lower prices into EU countries where the products are sold at higher prices);\n•compliance with a wide variety of potentially changing and conflicting laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery and corruption-related laws globally;\n•political and social instability, including crime, civil disturbance, terrorist activities and armed conflicts;\n•trade restrictions and restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities, including restrictions administered by OFAC and the EU, in relation to our products or the products of farmers and other customers (e.g., restrictions on the importation of agricultural products from the EU to Russia);\n•government limitations on foreign ownership or government takeover or nationalization of our business; \n•imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties or other trade-related sanctions;\n•costs and difficulties and compliance risks in staffing, managing and monitoring international operations, including the use of overseas third-party goods and service providers;\n•longer payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk; and\n•additional limitations on transferring personal information between countries or other restrictions on the processing of personal information.\nWhile the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any of them could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Changes in any of these laws, regulations or requirements, or the political environment in a particular country, may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets, including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings.\nForeign exchange rate fluctuations and potential currency controls affect our results of operations, as reported in our financial statements. \nWe conduct operations in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. In 2024, we generated approximately 41% of our revenue in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the euro, Brazilian real, Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar and Chinese renminbi. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenue. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates, \n23 |\n\n\nincluding changes in countries with highly inflationary economies, between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations.\nWe also face risks arising from currency devaluations and the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. Cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls. We currently have substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place, including China, and, if we were to need to repatriate or convert such cash, these controls and restrictions may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. \nWe may not be able to realize the expected benefits of our investments in emerging markets and are subject to certain risks due to our presence in emerging markets, including political or economic instability and failure to adequately comply with legal and regulatory requirements.\nWe have been taking steps to increase our presence in emerging markets. Failure to continue to maintain and expand our business in emerging markets could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nSome countries within emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of local, regional or global economic, political or social instability or crisis. Furthermore, we have also experienced lower than expected sales in certain emerging markets due to local, regional and global restrictions on banking and commercial activities in those countries. In addition, certain emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially, which may impact our financial performance. For example, in the past, our revenue in certain emerging markets in Latin America has been adversely impacted by currency fluctuations and devaluations. \nIn addition, certain emerging markets have legal systems that are less developed or familiar to us. Compliance with myriad legal requirements is costly and time-consuming and requires significant resources. In the event we believe or have reason to believe our employees have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to investigation costs, potential penalties and other related costs which in turn could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations.\nRisks related to tax matters\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or foreign tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. \nThe multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The company’s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nFor example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is continuing to work on fundamental changes in the allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business (Pillar One), as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (Pillar Two). Global minimum tax legislation has been proposed and/or enacted in various jurisdictions. These two pillars combined represent a significant change in the international tax regime, and there is risk of an adverse impact to our effective tax rate as legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business. We continue to monitor pending OECD guidance and legislation enactment and implementation by individual countries.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate is subject to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our cross-border arrangements and subject us to additional tax, adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability. The company is also subject to the examination of its tax positions, tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. For example, as disclosed in Note 8. Tax Matters, in September 2024, the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report related to the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax. Based on current facts and circumstances, we disagree with the IRS' position and will defend our position taken on the 2018 U.S. Federal Income Tax return, however, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this or other examinations. If the company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or other material foreign jurisdictions, or if the company's tax positions are either not sustained upon examination or only partially sustained, the company’s operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks related to intellectual property \nThe alleged intellectual property rights of third parties may negatively affect our business.\nA third party may sue us, our distributors or licensors, or otherwise make a claim, alleging infringement or other violation of the third-party's patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, domain names or other intellectual property rights. The costs of defending an intellectual property action are often substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, even if we successfully defend such action. Moreover, even if we believe that we do not infringe a validly existing third-party patent, we may choose to license such patent, which would result in associated costs and obligations. We may also incur costs in connection with an obligation to compensate a distributor, licensor or other third party. The intellectual property positions of animal health medicines and vaccines businesses frequently involve complex legal and factual questions, and an issued patent does not provide the right to practice the patented technology or to develop, manufacture or commercialize the patented product. We cannot guarantee that a competitor or other third party does not have or will not obtain rights to intellectual property that, in the absence of a license, may prevent us from manufacturing, developing or marketing certain of our products, regardless of whether we believe such intellectual property rights are valid and enforceable, which may harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our intellectual property rights are challenged or circumvented, competitors may be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts.\nOur long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret, data protection, and domain name protection \n24 |\n\n\nlaws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. In addition, many of our vaccine products and other products are based on or incorporate proprietary information, including proprietary master seeds and proprietary or patented adjuvant formulations.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. The validity, enforceability, scope and effective term of our intellectual property can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings that differ between jurisdictions. Our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights also depends on the laws of individual countries and each country's practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property rights. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreements or other agreements pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, including because such agreements expire or are terminated, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are regularly party to patent litigation and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming, and if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business and financial condition. \nRisks related to our indebtedness \nWe have substantial indebtedness. \nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $6.7 billion of total unsecured indebtedness outstanding. In addition, we currently have agreements for a multi-year revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program, each with a capacity of up to $1.0 billion. While we currently do not have any amounts drawn under the credit facility nor any commercial paper issued under the commercial paper program, we may incur indebtedness under these arrangements in the future. \nWe may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important consequences, including: \n•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt; \n•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business development or other general corporate requirements, including dividends; \n•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; \n•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings may in the future be at variable rates of interest; \n•limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the animal health industry; \n•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other, less leveraged competitors; \n•impacting our effective tax rate; and \n•increasing our cost of borrowing. \nIn addition, the instruments governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default, which could result in the acceleration of all our debt. \nOur credit ratings may not reflect all risks of an investment in our senior notes. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, could affect the market prices of our securities and increase our borrowing costs.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. \nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness. \nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of material assets or operations, alter our dividend policy, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. \nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will depend on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries, including certain international subsidiaries, and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. \nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, may materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and liquidity and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or pay dividends on our common stock. \n25 |\n\n\nWe may not have the funds necessary to finance the change of control offer required by the indenture governing our senior notes.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control of Zoetis and a downgrade below investment grade by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. and S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior notes. However, we may not have sufficient funds available at the time of the change of control to finance the required change of control offer or restrictions in our then-existing debt instruments will not allow such repurchases. Our failure to purchase the senior notes as required under the indenture would result in a default under the indenture, which could have material adverse consequences for us and the holders of the senior notes.\nRisks related to our relationship with Pfizer\nPfizer's rights as licensor under the patent and know-how license could limit our ability to develop and commercialize certain products.\nUnder the Patent and Know-How License Agreement (Pfizer as licensor) Pfizer licenses to us certain of its intellectual property. If we fail to comply with our obligations under this license agreement and Pfizer exercises its right to terminate it, our ability to continue to research, develop and commercialize products incorporating that intellectual property will be limited. In addition, in circumstances where Pfizer has an interest in the licensed intellectual property in connection with its human health development programs, our rights to use the licensed intellectual property are restricted and/or, in limited instances, subject to Pfizer's right to terminate such license at will. These limitations and termination rights may make it more difficult, time-consuming or expensive for us to develop and commercialize certain new products, or may result in our products being later to market than those of our competitors. \nWe are dependent on Pfizer to prosecute, maintain and enforce certain intellectual property.\nUnder the Patent and Know-How License Agreement, Pfizer is responsible for filing, prosecuting and maintaining patents that Pfizer licenses to us. In the animal health field, Pfizer has the first right, and in some cases the sole right, to enforce such licensed patents, and in the human health field, subject to certain exceptions, Pfizer has the sole right to enforce the licensed patents. If Pfizer fails to fulfill its obligations or chooses to not enforce the licensed patents under this agreement, we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competitive products, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\n26 |",
