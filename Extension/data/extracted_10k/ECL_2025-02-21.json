We deliver sustainable solutions that help companies around the world achieve their business goals while reducing environmental impacts. We partner with customers around the world to reduce water and energy use as well as greenhouse gas emissions through our high-efficiency solutions. By partnering with our customers to help them do more with less through the use of our innovative and differentiated solutions, we aim to help our customers conserve more than 300 billion gallons of water annually by 2030. In 2023, we helped our customers conserve more than 226 billion gallons of water and avoid more than 3.8 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. \n​\nThe following description of our business is based upon our reportable segments as reported in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, which are located in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K. Operating segments that share similar economic characteristics and future prospects, including the nature of the products and production processes, end-use markets, channels of distribution and regulatory environment, have been aggregated into four reportable segments: Global Industrial, Global Institutional & Specialty, Global Healthcare & Life Sciences and Global Pest Elimination. \n​\n​\n​\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nGlobal Industrial\n​\nThis reportable segment consists of the Water, Food & Beverage and Paper operating segments, which provide water treatment and process applications, and cleaning and sanitizing solutions, primarily to large industrial customers within the manufacturing, food and beverage processing, transportation, chemical, primary metals and mining, power generation, global refining, petrochemical, pulp and paper industries. The underlying operating segments exhibit similar manufacturing processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics. Descriptions of the three operating segments which comprise our Global Industrial reportable segment follow below.\n​\nWater\n​\nWater serves customers across industrial and institutional markets. Within Water, our light industry markets include food and beverage, manufacturing and transportation, institutional clients including commercial buildings, hospitals, universities and hotels, and global high technology serving customers including data centers and microelectronics. Heavy industries served include power, chemicals and primary metals, mining and petroleum refining and fuels industry. \n​\nWater provides water treatment products and technology programs for cooling water, wastewater, boiler water and process water applications. In addition to these solutions, we offer specialty programs to the petroleum and fuels industry – refining process applications, fuels and feedstocks additives. Our cooling water treatment programs are designed to control challenges associated with cooling water systems — corrosion, scale and microbial fouling and contamination — in open recirculating, once-through and closed systems. Our wastewater products and programs focus on improving overall plant economics, addressing compliance issues, optimizing equipment efficiency and improving operator capabilities and effectiveness. We provide integrated chemical and digitally-based solutions, process improvements and mechanical component modifications to optimize boiler performance and control corrosion and scale build-up. Our programs assist in more effectively managing water use for plant processes by optimizing the performance of treatment chemicals and equipment in order to minimize costs and maximize returns on investment. \n​\nOur offerings include specialty products such as scale and corrosion inhibitors, antifoulants, pre-treatment solutions, membrane treatments, coagulants and flocculants, anti-foamers, hydrogen sulfide removal, cold flow improvers, lubricity inhibitors, crude desalting and reactive monomer inhibitors, as well as our 3D TRASARTM technologies, which combine chemistry, remote services and monitoring and control. We provide products and programs for water treatment and process applications aimed at combining environmental benefits with economic gains for our customers. Typically, water savings, energy savings and operating efficiency are among our primary sources of value creation for our customers, with product quality and production enhancement improvements also providing key differentiating features for many of our offerings. Our offerings are sold primarily by our corporate account and field sales employees.\n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading global suppliers of products and programs for chemical applications within the industrial water treatment and petroleum refining industries.\n​\nFood & Beverage\n​\nFood & Beverage provides cleaning and sanitation products and programs to facilitate the processing of products for human consumption. Food & Beverage provides detergents, cleaners, sanitizers, lubricants and animal health products, as well as cleaning systems, digitally-based dispensers, monitors and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products, primarily to dairy plants; dairy, swine and poultry farms; breweries and soft-drink bottling plants as well as meat, poultry and other food processors. Food & Beverage is also a leading developer and marketer of antimicrobial products used in direct contact with meat, poultry, seafood and produce during processing in order to reduce microbial contamination. Food & Beverage also designs, engineers and installs CIP (“clean-in-place”) process control systems and facility cleaning systems for its customer base. Water savings, energy savings, and operating efficiency are among our sources of value creation for our customers. Products for use in processing facilities are sold primarily by our corporate account and field sales employees, while products for use on farms are sold through dealers and independent, third-party distributors.\n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading global suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the dairy plant, dairy, swine and poultry farm, beverage/brewery, food, meat and poultry, and beverage/brewery processing industries.\n​\nPaper\n​\nPaper provides water and process applications for the pulp and paper industries, offering a comprehensive portfolio of programs that are used in all principal steps of the papermaking process and across all grades of paper, including graphic grades, board and packaging, and tissue and towel. While Paper provides its customers similar types of products and programs for water treatment and wastewater treatment as those offered by Water, Paper also offers two specialty programs that differentiate its offerings from Water—pulp applications and paper applications. Our pulp applications maximize process efficiency and increase pulp cleanliness and brightness in bleaching operations, as well as predict and monitor scaling potential utilizing on-line monitoring to design effective treatment programs and avoid costly failures. Our paper process applications focus on improving our customers’ operational efficiency, in part through water savings, energy savings and operating efficiency. Advanced digital sensing, monitoring and automation combine with innovative chemistries and detailed process knowledge to provide a broad range of customer solutions. Specialty products include flocculants, coagulants, dewatering aids and digester yield additives. Our offerings are sold primarily by our corporate account and field sales employees.\n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading global suppliers of water treatment products and process aids to the pulp and papermaking industry.\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nGlobal Institutional & Specialty\n​\nThis reportable segment consists of the Institutional and Specialty operating segments, which provide specialized cleaning and sanitizing products to the foodservice, hospitality, lodging, government, education and retail industries. The underlying operating segments exhibit similar manufacturing processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics. Descriptions of the two operating segments which comprise our Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment follow below.\n​\nInstitutional\n​\nInstitutional sells specialized cleaners and sanitizers for washing dishes, glassware, flatware, foodservice utensils and kitchen equipment (“warewashing”), plus specialized cleaners for various applications throughout food service operations, on-premise laundries (typically used by hotel and healthcare customers) and general housekeeping functions. We also sell food safety products and equipment, water filters, dishwasher racks and related kitchen sundries to the foodservice, lodging, educational and healthcare industries. Institutional also provides pool and spa treatment programs for hospitality and other commercial customers, as well as a broad range of janitorial cleaning and floor care products and programs to customers in hospitality, healthcare and commercial facilities. Institutional develops various digital monitoring and chemical dispensing systems which are used by our customers to efficiently and safely dispense our cleaners and sanitizers, and through these products, systems and our on-site sales and service expertise, develop better results for our customers including water savings, energy savings and operating efficiency. In addition, Institutional markets a lease program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance. Through our EcoSure Brand Protection business, Institutional also provides customized on-site evaluations, training and quality assurance services to foodservice and hospitality operations.\n​\nInstitutional sells its products and programs primarily through its direct field sales and corporate account sales personnel. Corporate account sales personnel establish relationships and negotiate contracts with larger multi-unit or “chain” customers. We also utilize independent, third-party foodservice, broad-line and janitorial distributors to provide logistics to end customers that prefer to work through these distributors. Many of these distributors also participate in marketing our product and service offerings to the end customers. Through our field sales personnel, we generally provide the same customer support to end-use customers supplied by these distributors as we do to direct customers.\n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading global suppliers of warewashing and laundry products and programs to the food service, hospitality and lodging markets.\n​\nSpecialty\n​\nSpecialty supplies cleaning and sanitizing products and related items primarily to regional, national and international quick service restaurant (“QSR”) chains and food retailers (i.e., supermarkets and grocery stores). Its products include specialty and general purpose hard surface cleaners, degreasers, sanitizers, polishes, hand care products and assorted cleaning tools and equipment which are primarily sold under the “Ecolab” and “Kay” brand names. QSR’s program also includes a lease program comprised of energy-efficient dishwashing machines, detergents, rinse additives and sanitizers, including full machine maintenance. Specialty’s cleaning and sanitation programs are customized to meet the needs of the market segments it serves and are designed to provide highly effective cleaning performance, promote food safety, reduce labor, water and energy costs and enhance user and guest safety. A number of dispensing options are available for products in the core product range. Specialty supports its product sales with training programs and technical support designed to meet the special needs of its customers.\n​\nBoth Specialty’s QSR business and its food retail business utilize their corporate account sales force which manages relationships with customers at the corporate and regional office levels (and, in the QSR market segment, at the franchisee level) and their field sales force which provides program support at the individual restaurant or store level. QSR customers are primarily supplied through third party distributors while most food retail customers utilize their own distribution networks. While Specialty’s customer base has broadened significantly over the years, Specialty’s business remains largely dependent upon a limited number of major QSR chains and franchisees and large food retail customers.\n​\nFood Safety Solutions supplies a digital platform that combines software, hardware and multiple services to automate kitchen procedures for efficiency and compliance. It also offers a unique variety of products, tools and equipment for food preparation, food rotation labeling, temperature management, cleaning and employee safety across all food service customers. \n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading suppliers of cleaning and sanitizing products to the global QSR market and the global food retail market. \n​\n​\n​\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nGlobal Healthcare & Life Sciences\n​\nThis reportable segment consists of the Healthcare and Life Sciences operating segments, which provide specialized cleaning and sanitizing products to the healthcare, personal care and pharmaceutical industries. The underlying operating segments exhibit similar manufacturing processes, distribution methods and economic characteristics. Descriptions of the two operating segments which comprise our Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment follow below.\n​\nHealthcare\n​\nHealthcare provides infection prevention solutions to acute care hospitals, surgery centers and medical device Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”). Healthcare’s proprietary infection prevention solutions (hand hygiene, hard surface disinfection, digital monitoring systems and instrument cleaning) are sold primarily under the \"Ecolab\" and “Anios” brand names to various departments within the acute care environment (Infection Control, Environmental Services, Central Sterile and Operating Room). Healthcare sells its products and programs principally through its field sales personnel and corporate account personnel but also sells through healthcare distributors. \n​\nWe believe we are one of the leading suppliers of infection prevention solutions in the United States and Europe. \n​\nLife Sciences\n​\nLife Sciences provides end-to-end cleaning and contamination control solutions to pharmaceutical and personal care manufacturers. These products are primarily sold under the “Ecolab” brand name, and include detergents, cleaners, sanitizers, disinfectants, surface wipes, as well as cleaning systems, electronic dispensers and chemical injectors for the application of chemical products. The Life Sciences portfolio includes premium fluid treatment and purification solutions with a broad range of unique products sold under the “Purolite” brand name, particularly focusing on biopharma purification solutions, active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API’s”) and high value industrial applications. The Life Sciences portfolio also includes decontamination systems and services utilizing hydrogen peroxide vapor, which are sold under the “Bioquell” brand name. The pharmaceutical clean room environment is the primary area that Ecolab and Bioquell products are utilized. Products and programs are sold primarily through our field sales and corporate account personnel, and to a lesser extent through distributors.\n ​\nLife Sciences is comprised of customers and accounts related to manufacturing in the following industries: pharmaceutical, animal health and medicine, blood purification and dialysis, biologic products, cosmetics and medical devices. Our tailored, comprehensive solutions and technical know-how focus on ensuring product quality, safety and compliance standards are met while improving operational efficiency in customers’ cleaning, sanitation and disinfection processes. We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of process purification solutions in Europe and North America and of contamination control solutions in Europe, with a growing presence in North America and other regions. \n​\n​\nGlobal Pest Elimination\n​\nThis reportable segment consists of the Pest Elimination operating segment. \n​\nPest Elimination\n​\nPest Elimination provides services designed to detect, prevent and eliminate pests, such as rodents and insects, in full-service and quick-service restaurants, food and beverage processors, hotels, grocery operations and other commercial segments including education, life sciences and healthcare.\n​\nIn addition to the United States, which constitutes our largest operation, we operate in various countries in Asia Pacific, Greater China, Western Europe, Latin America, and Africa.\n​\nWe believe Pest Elimination is a leading service provider of effective, high-quality pest elimination programs that deliver high quality outcomes to commercial segments in the geographies it serves.\n​\n​\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n​\nInternational Operations\n​\nWe directly operate in approximately 100 countries outside of the United States through wholly-owned subsidiaries or, in some cases, through a joint venture with a local partner. In certain countries, selected products are sold by our export operations to distributors, agents or licensees, although the volume of those sales is not significant in terms of our overall revenues. In general, our businesses conducted outside the United States are similar to those conducted in the United States.\n​\nOur business operations outside the United States are subject to the usual risks of foreign operations, including possible changes in trade and foreign investment laws, international business laws and regulations, tax laws, currency exchange rates and economic and political conditions. The profitability of our international operations is generally lower than the profitability of our businesses in the United States, due to (i) the additional cost of operating in numerous and diverse foreign jurisdictions with varying laws and regulations, (ii) higher costs of importing certain raw materials and finished goods in some regions, (iii) the smaller scale of international operations where certain operating locations are smaller in size, and (iv) the additional reliance on distributors and agents in certain countries which can negatively impact our margins. Proportionately larger investments in sales and technical support are also necessary in certain geographies in order to facilitate the growth of our international operations.\n​\nCompetition\n​\nIn general, the markets in which the businesses in our Global Industrial reportable segment compete are led by a few large companies, with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services. Our businesses in this segment compete on the basis of their demonstrated value, technical expertise, innovation, digital technology, chemical formulations, global customer support, detection equipment, monitoring capabilities, and dosing and metering equipment. Through the combination of our digitally enabled end-to-end water management and hygiene solutions, data-driven insights and personalized service, our Global Industrial businesses deliver outcomes that help our customers optimize water and energy use, improve productivity, advance food safety, and achieve sustainability and net zero goals, while optimizing total cost of operations.\n​\nThe businesses in our Global Institutional & Specialty and Global Pest Elimination reportable segments have two significant classes of competitors. First, we compete with a small number of large companies selling directly or through distributors on a national or international scale. Second, we have numerous smaller regional or local competitors which focus on more limited geographies, product lines and/or end-use customer segments. We believe we compete principally by providing superior value, premium customer support, training, service, and innovative and differentiated products to help our customers protect their brand reputation and improve their operational efficiency.\n​\nWithin the Global Healthcare & Life Sciences reportable segment, the Healthcare business competes geographically with companies primarily focused on a smaller range of product categories, with few globally scaled competitors. The Life Sciences business competes in the European market versus several mid-size and regional competitors and competes against two large and other mid-size or regional competitors in North America. Outside of North America and Europe competitors are much more fragmented and do not offer the same level of service or coverage as Ecolab. Our businesses in this segment compete by enabling our customers success through improved hygiene, digitally enabled programs in operating room and patient room space as well as a tailored approach to delivering key inputs that directly impact our customers patients globally.\n​\nSales\n​\nOur products, systems and services are primarily marketed in domestic and international markets by our Company-trained direct field sales personnel who also advise and assist our customers in the proper and most efficient use of the products and systems in order to meet a full range of cleaning and sanitation, water treatment and process chemistry needs. Independent, third-party distributors and, to a lesser extent, sales agents, are utilized in several markets, as described in the segment descriptions found above.\n​\nCustomers and Classes of Products\n​\nWe believe our business is not materially dependent upon a single customer. Additionally, although we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constituted 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues in 2024, 2023 or 2022, we do have customers and independent third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the affected earnings periods; however, we consider it unlikely that such an event would have a material adverse impact on our financial position. No material part of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination at the election of a governmental unit.\n​\nWe sold one class of products within the Global Institutional & Specialty reportable segment which comprised 10% or more of consolidated net sales in the last three years. Sales of warewashing products were approximately 12% of consolidated net sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n​\n\n\n7\n\n\n\nHuman Capital\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, Ecolab employed approximately 48,000 employees. The largest component of our workforce is more than 25,000 sales and service employees. Our innovation efforts are supported by approximately 3,000 research, development, engineering and digital experts. Approximately 44% of the employees are employed in North America, 21% in Europe, 12% in Latin America, 8% in Asia Pacific, 8% in India, Middle East and Africa, and 7% in Greater China. \n​\nWe believe that doing the right thing, the right way, is good for business. We believe that driving performance and growing fast, we can deliver a net positive impact in our own operations and what we deliver for our customers. We believe that Ecolab’s century-long growth, innovation and high performance have benefited from a workplace where individuals from all backgrounds are encouraged to reach their full potential. We believe in providing training and career development opportunities to all employees and in compensating and rewarding our employees equitably.\n​\nOur commitment to the safety of our employees, contractors, and customers is evident in the way we operate, the products we develop, and the customers we serve. In addition, we are committed to promoting the health and well-being of our employees, our customers, and their customers by contributing to programs and initiatives that enhance the quality of life in the communities where they work and live. In support of these overall objectives, key areas of focus include: \n​\nWorkplace Culture: With approximately 48,000 associates in more than 170 countries, Ecolab representatives engage daily with a diverse range of colleagues, customers, and communities. We are committed to developing a culture where all voices are heard and equitable employment opportunities are available to everyone. To sustain our success, we work to embed our values of inclusivity and engagement throughout our people processes, including recruitment, retention and development. \n​\nWe also have a vibrant and growing community of 11 Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that are open to all Ecolab associates, to help employees connect with colleagues, take part in career and leadership development experiences, and provide important insights that help advance our workplace culture. All employees are welcome and encouraged to join, participate, or become leaders and allies within any of our ERGs.\n​\nEmployee Training and Development: Ecolab’s growth has been characterized by a century of supporting customers by combining science, technology and innovation with the expertise of our associates. Beyond rigorous technical, functional, and business-specific training courses, our Global Corporate Flagship Development Programs for supervisors, managers and leaders are designed to deepen leadership capability and prepare potential successors for key leadership roles. \n​\nCompensation and Benefits: Ecolab has a market-competitive and performance-based pay philosophy, and we believe in compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are committed to rewarding and recognizing employees for their contributions to the success of the organization. This includes our global merit increase program and our short- and long-term variable pay programs, which include goals and targets that are tied to the success of the business. We test our pay and wage data against compensation surveys to align our pay with the competitive external market. In the U.S., we conduct pay equity studies, and we are in the process of expanding pay equity studies outside the U.S.\n​\nEcolab also provides market-competitive benefits based on country-specific needs and government requirements. While our benefits packages vary by market, they are designed to attract top talent and build long-term connections with our associates. Aligned to the applicable market and local regulations, elements of our benefits programs may include medical and dental insurance, retirement savings, employee stock purchase plan, paid time off, parental leave and adoption assistance, life and disability insurance, and employee assistance plans.\n​\nSafety, Health, and Wellness: At Ecolab, the safety of our employees and contractors is a top priority and is embedded into our company values. Our safety goals are simple: zero accidents, zero injuries, and zero violations. We communicate that this is a collective goal all employees commit to, own, and deliver on every day. Our leadership teams and a network of Safety, Health, and Environment professionals around the world support employees with robust safety programs, processes, and platforms. Understanding underlying and potential risks is a critical component to improving safety outcomes. Our Global Safety Dashboard tracks our performance on a range of leading and lagging safety indicators and helps us measure the effectiveness of our safety programs.\n​\n\n\n8\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a Be Well Program is available to U.S. employees and their families to empower, educate and support their personal journey to overall well-being by making positive lifestyle choices while creating a culture of wellness throughout Ecolab. Over the last few years, we’ve expanded our offerings to include comprehensive child and elder caregiver resources to help employees balance the demands of work and personal responsibilities. Wellness initiatives are also underway outside the U.S. aligned to country-specific needs and market practices.\n\n​\nPatents and Trademarks\n​\nWe own and license a number of patents, trademarks and other intellectual property. While we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents or trademarks and pursuing legal action, when appropriate, to prevent infringement, except for the items listed below, we do not believe our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark.\n​\n\n●   Trademarks related to Ecolab, Nalco and 3D TRASAR, which collectively are material to all of our reportable segments. The Ecolab, Nalco and 3D TRASAR trademarks are registered or applied for in all of our key markets and we anticipate maintaining them indefinitely.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nSeasonality\n​\nWe experience variability in our quarterly operating results due to seasonal sales volume and business mix fluctuations in our operating segments. Part II, Item 8, Note 20, entitled “Quarterly Financial Data” of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference. \n​\nInvestments in Equipment\n​\nWe have invested, and plan to continue to invest, in process control and monitoring equipment consisting primarily of systems used by customers to dispense our products as well as to monitor water systems. The investment in such equipment is discussed under the heading \"Investing Activities\" in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.\n​\nManufacturing and Distribution\n​\nWe manufacture most of our products and related equipment in Company-operated manufacturing facilities. Some products are also produced for us by third-party contract manufacturers. Other products and equipment are purchased from third-party suppliers. Additional information on product/equipment sourcing is found in the segment discussions above and additional information on our manufacturing facilities is located under Part I, Item 2. “Properties,” of this Form 10-K.\n​\nDeliveries to customers are made from our manufacturing plants and a network of distribution centers and third-party logistics service providers. We use common carriers, our own delivery vehicles, and distributors for transport. Additional information on our plant and distribution facilities is located under Part I, Item 2. “Properties,” of this Form 10-K.\n​\nRaw Materials\n​\nRaw materials purchased for use in manufacturing our products are inorganic chemicals, including alkalis, acids, biocides, phosphonates, phosphorous materials, silicates and salts; and organic chemicals, including acids, alcohols, amines, fatty acids, surfactants, solvents, monomers and polymers. Pesticides used by Pest Elimination are purchased as finished products under contract or purchase order from the producers or their distributors. We also purchase packaging materials for our manufactured products and components for our specialized cleaning equipment and systems. We purchase more than 10,000 raw materials, with the largest single raw material representing approximately four percent of raw material purchases. Our raw materials, with the exception of a few specialized chemicals which we manufacture, are generally purchased on an annual contract basis and are ordinarily available in adequate quantities from a diverse group of suppliers globally. When practical, global sourcing is used so that purchasing or production locations can be shifted to control product costs.\n​\nResearch and Development\n​\nOur research and development program consists principally of developing and validating the performance of new products, processes, techniques and equipment, improving the efficiency of those already existing, improving service program content, evaluating the environmental compatibility of products and technical support. Key disciplines include analytical and formulation chemistry, microbiology, data science and predictive analytics, process and packaging engineering, digital and remote monitoring engineering and product dispensing technology. Substantially all of our principal products have been developed by our research, development and engineering personnel. \n​\nWe believe continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position within the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers. \n​\n\n\n9\n\n\n\nJoint Ventures\n​\nOver time, we have entered into partnerships or joint ventures in order to meet local ownership requirements, to achieve quicker operational scale, to expand our ability to provide our customers a more fully integrated offering or to provide other benefits to our business or customers. During 2024, the impact on our consolidated net income of our joint ventures, in the aggregate, was approximately three percent. We will continue to evaluate the potential for partnerships and joint ventures that can assist us in increasing our geographic, technological and product reach.\n​\nEnvironmental and Regulatory Considerations\n​\nOur businesses are subject to various legislative enactments and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and public health. While we cooperate with governmental authorities and take commercially practicable measures to meet regulatory requirements and avoid or limit environmental effects, some risks are inherent in our businesses. Among the risks are costs associated with transporting and managing hazardous materials and waste disposal and plant site clean-up, fines and penalties if we are found to be in violation of law, as well as modifications, disruptions or discontinuation of certain operations or types of operations including product recalls and reformulations. Similarly, the need for certain of our products and services is dependent upon or might be limited by governmental laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations, including among others, air, water, chemical and product regulations, could impact the sales of some of our products or services. In addition to an increase in costs of manufacturing and delivering products, a change in production regulations or product regulations could result in interruptions to our business and potentially cause economic or consequential losses should we be unable to meet the demands of our customers for products.\n​\nAdditionally, although we are not currently aware of any such circumstances, there can be no assurance that future legislation or enforcement policies will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Environmental and regulatory matters most significant to us are discussed below.\n​\nIngredient Legislation: Various laws and regulations have been enacted by state, local and foreign jurisdictions pertaining to the sale of products which contain phosphorous, volatile organic compounds, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) or other ingredients that may impact human health or the environment. Under California Proposition 65, for example, label disclosures are required for certain products containing chemicals listed by California. Chemical management initiatives that promote pollution prevention through research and development of safer chemicals and safer chemical processes are being advanced by several states. \n​\nEnvironmentally preferable purchasing programs for cleaning products have been enacted in a number of states to date, and in recent years have been considered by several other state legislatures. Cleaning product ingredient disclosure legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress in each of the past few years but has not passed, and several states are considering further regulations in this area. In 2017, California passed the Cleaning Product Right to Know Act of 2017, that required ingredient transparency on-line and on-label by 2020 and 2021, respectively. The U.S. Government is monitoring “green chemistry” initiatives through a variety of initiatives, including its “Design for the Environment” (“DfE”)/“Safer Choice” program. DfE/Safer Choice has three broad areas of work (recognition of safer products on a DfE/Safer Choice label, development of best practices for industrial processes and evaluation of safer chemicals), and we are involved in these to varying degrees. Our Global Institutional and Global Industrial cleaning products are subject to the regulations and may incur additional stay-in-market expenses associated with conducting the required alternatives analyses for chemicals of concern. To date, we generally have been able to comply with such legislative requirements by reformulation or labeling modifications. Such legislation has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows to date.\n​\nTSCA: The nation’s primary chemicals management law, the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”), was updated with the passage of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (“LCSA”) in 2016. The LCSA modernizes the original 1976 legislation, aiming to establish greater public confidence in the safety of chemical substances in commerce and improve the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) capability and authority to regulate existing and new chemical substances. For Ecolab, the TSCA changes mainly impact testing and submission costs for new and existing chemical substances in the United States. As a result of reform and multiple administration changes, EPA reviews are resulting in the majority of new substances being regulated in some manner by the agency. As the agency continues to review existing chemistries, the likelihood that substances manufactured, imported, or processed by Ecolab may be subject to additional testing costs and/or risk management decisions is increasing. Future EPA risk evaluation decisions may result in the reduction or elimination of future uses for some products. Compliance with new requirements under TSCA are similar to the costs associated with REACH in the European Union, which is discussed below.\n​\nREACH: The European Union has enacted a regulatory framework for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (“REACH”), which aims to manage chemical safety risks. REACH established a European Chemicals Agency (“ECHA”) in Helsinki, Finland, which is responsible for evaluating data to determine hazards and risks and to manage this program for authorizing chemicals for sale and distribution in Europe. We met all REACH registration requirements. To help manage this program, we have been simplifying our product lines and working with chemical suppliers to comply with registration requirements. In addition, Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, India, Chile and Colombia and other countries have implemented or are implementing similar requirements. In addition, the European Green Deal will include the revision of chemical management regulation to achieve a circular economy and toxic-free environment (Chemical Strategy for Sustainability) which may impact sales in Ecolab’s raw material portfolio. Potential costs to us are not yet fully quantifiable but are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nGHS: In 2003, the United Nations adopted a standard on hazard communication and labeling of chemical products known as the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (“GHS”). GHS is designed to facilitate international trade and increase safe handling and use of hazardous chemicals through a worldwide system that classifies chemicals based on their intrinsic hazards and communicates information about those hazards through standardized product labels and safety data sheets (“SDSs”). As of 2024, most countries in which we operate have adopted or are expected to adopt GHS-related legislation. The primary cost of compliance revolves around reclassifying products and revising SDSs and product labels. We have met applicable deadlines and are working toward a phased-in approach to mitigate the costs of GHS implementation in remaining countries (e.g., Peru, Chile, India). We are also implementing updates, where applicable, of GHS revisions in countries where it is already present (e.g., US, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore). Potential costs to us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or on our financial position.\n​\nPesticide and Biocide Legislation: Various international, federal and state environmental laws and regulations govern the manufacture and/or use of pesticides. We manufacture and sell certain disinfecting, sanitizing and material preservation products that kill or reduce microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) on hard environmental surfaces, in process fluids and on certain food products. Such products constitute “pesticides” or “antimicrobial pesticides” under the current definitions of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), as amended by the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the principal federal statute governing the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides. We maintain several hundred product registrations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Registration entails the necessity to meet certain efficacy, toxicity and labeling requirements and to pay on-going registration fees. In addition, each state in which these products are sold requires registration and payment of a fee. In general, the states impose no substantive requirements different from those required by FIFRA. However, California and certain other states have adopted additional regulatory programs, and California imposes a tax on total pesticide sales in that state. While the cost of complying with rules as to pesticides has not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows to date, the costs and delays in receiving necessary approvals for these products continue to increase. Total fees paid to the EPA and the states to obtain or maintain pesticide registrations are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position.\n​\nIn Europe, the Biocidal Products Regulation established a program to evaluate and authorize marketing of biocidal active substances and products. We are working with suppliers and industry groups to manage these requirements and have met all relevant deadlines of the program by the timely submission of dossiers for active substances and biocide products. Anticipated registration costs, which will be incurred through the multi-year phase-in period, will be significant; however, these costs are not expected to significantly affect our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any one reporting period or our financial position. The same is true for emerging biocide regulations in Asia.\n​\nIn addition, Pest Elimination applies restricted-use pesticides that it generally purchases from third parties. That business must comply with certain standards pertaining to the use of such pesticides and to the licensing of employees who apply such pesticides. Such regulations are enforced primarily by the states or local jurisdictions in conformity with federal regulations. We have not experienced material difficulties in complying with these requirements. \n​\nFDA Antimicrobial Product Requirements: Various laws and regulations have been enacted by federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions regulating certain products manufactured and sold by us for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and foods. In the United States, these requirements generally are administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and EPA also may share in regulatory jurisdiction of antimicrobials applied to food. The FDA codifies regulations for these product categories in order to ensure product quality, safety and effectiveness. The FDA also has been expanding requirements applicable to such products, including proposing regulations for over-the-counter antiseptic drug products, which may impose additional requirements associated with antimicrobial hand care products and associated costs when finalized by the FDA.\n​\n​\n\n\n11\n\n\n\nMedical Device, Drug and Cosmetic Product Requirements: As a manufacturer, distributor and marketer of medical devices and human drugs, we also are subject to regulation by the FDA and corresponding regulatory agencies of the state, local and foreign governments in which we sell our products. These regulations govern the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical devices and medicinal products, including Advanced Pharmaceutical Ingredients (“API”), excipients and resins for biopharmaceutical processing. \n​\n\n●   In the United States, we are required to register with the FDA as a medical device, drug and cosmetic manufacturer, comply with post-market reporting (e.g., Adverse Event Reporting, MDR and Recall) requirements, and to comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Practice Guidelines (“GxPs”), which ensure that products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards and must be approved by the competent authorities.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\n\n●   Countries in the European Union require that certain products being sold within their jurisdictions obtain a “CE mark,” an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards, and be manufactured in compliance with certain requirements (e.g., Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (“MDR”), and ISO 13485). We have CE mark approval to sell various medical devices. Implementation of the MDR has required additional investments, including system, product, process, technical file and product improvements. Additionally, pharmaceutical products in the EU must comply with regulations such as the GxP guidelines.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\n\n●   In Australia, products must comply with the regulations set by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”). Medical devices must be included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (“ARTG”) and meet the Essential Principles for safety and performance. Therapeutic goods, including drugs and cosmetics, must adhere to specific standards and regulatory frameworks for safety, quality, efficacy, labelling, and claims.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\n\n●   Non-EU export markets are also subject to government regulation and country-specific rules and regulations.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nEquipment: Ecolab’s products are dispensed by equipment that is subject to state and local regulatory requirements, as well as being subject to UL, NSF, and other approval requirements. For certain digitally connected product offerings, Federal Communication Commission (“FCC”) and corresponding international requirements are applicable. We have both dedicated manufacturing facilities and third-party production of our equipment. We are developing processes to monitor and manage changing regulatory regimes and assist with equipment systems compliance. To date, such requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n​\nOther Environmental Legislation: Our manufacturing plants are subject to federal, state, local or foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations relating to discharge of hazardous substances into the environment and to the transportation, handling and disposal of such substances. The primary federal statutes that apply to our activities in the United States are the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. We are also subject to the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, which imposes certain reporting requirements as to emissions of hazardous substances into the air, land and water. The products we produce and distribute into Europe are also subject to directives governing electrical waste (WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU) and restrictive substances (RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU). Similar legal requirements apply to Ecolab’s facilities globally. We make capital investments and expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to promote employee safety and to carry out our announced environmental sustainability principles. To date, such expenditures have not had a significant adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Our capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety projects worldwide were approximately $56 million in 2024, $46 million in 2023 and $35 million in 2022. Approximately $60 million has been budgeted globally for projects in 2025. \n​\nClimate Change: Various laws and regulations addressing climate change are being implemented or considered at international, national, regional, and state levels, particularly focusing on reducing greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Notable regulations include California's 2023 GHG emissions reporting regulations addressing emissions, climate-related risks, and reduction claims, and the European Commission’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which became effective January 2024 and is applicable to both EU and certain non-EU companies with a phased introduction. We are or may become subject to many of these laws. We continue to monitor and evaluate these regulations and incorporate reporting and disclosure obligations as appropriate. \n​\nEcolab recognizes that climate change presents both risks and opportunities. We assess climate-related risks within our Enterprise Risk Management process, aligned with the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations. Our TCFD disclosures are available in our annual CDP Climate report on our website. Since our first TCFD-aligned climate risk assessment in 2021, we have continued to review and adapt our strategies to manage climate risks and leverage opportunities for customer impact. We also evaluate potential water-related risks in our operations, disclosing the results in our Growth and Impact Report. Future analyses will explore nature-related risks linked to climate and water, aligned with the Task Force on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (“TNFD”) recommendations. \n​\nAs a corporate policy, we support a balanced approach to reducing GHG emissions while sustaining economic growth. We have established climate related goals to further our commitment. In 2019, we announced goals to reduce operational GHG emissions by half by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050, in alignment with the UN Global Compact’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C. In 2020, we further committed to move to 100% renewable energy by 2030 and set a science-based target (“SBT”) for Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions. In 2024, our net zero target for Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) validation was \n\n\n12\n\n\n\napproved, including a near term Scope 3 target. Our near-term SBT aims to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% from 2018 levels, and Scope 3 emissions by 25% from 2022 levels, by 2030.\n​\nIn 2023, we invested $63 million and $5.7 million in capital and operating environmental program expenses, respectively. The investments resulted in a reduction of total energy consumption by almost 5.7 billion BTUs; reduction of emissions by 700 metric tons CO2e; and over 153 million gallons (~580,000 cubic meters) of water savings from reduction and recycling projects. These reductions are calculated using direct measurements (such as meter readings and utility reports for water) and best-practice methodologies, with 2018 as the baseline year.\n​\nBeyond our operations, we help customers in over 170 countries reduce their energy and GHG emissions through high-efficiency solutions in cleaning, sanitation, water, paper, and energy services. Our 2030 goals include: customer GHG emissions reduction of 6.0 million metric tons; water stewardship to restore over 50% of our water withdrawal and achieve Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard certification in high-risk watersheds; and water conservation to reduce net water withdrawals by 40% per unit of production and help customers conserve over 300 billion gallons of water annually.\n​\nThe science of sustainability is evolving. For factors that may affect our sustainability initiatives, goals, and targets, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K, entitled “Risk Factors.”\n​\nEnvironmental Remediation and Proceedings: Along with numerous other potentially responsible parties (“PRP”), we are currently involved with waste disposal site clean-up activities imposed by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) or state equivalents at 16 sites in the United States. Additionally, we have similar liability at six sites outside the United States. In general, under CERCLA, we and each other PRP that actually contributed hazardous substances to a Superfund site are jointly and severally liable for the costs associated with cleaning up the site. Customarily, the PRPs will work with the EPA to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. \n​\nBased on an analysis of our experience with such environmental proceedings, our estimated share of all hazardous materials deposited on the sites referred to in the preceding paragraph, and our estimate of the contribution to be made by other PRPs which we believe have the financial ability to pay their shares, we have accrued our best estimate of our probable future costs relating to such known sites. In establishing accruals, potential insurance reimbursements are not included. The accrual is not discounted. It is not feasible to predict when the amounts accrued will be paid due to the uncertainties inherent in the environmental remediation and associated regulatory processes.\n​\nWe have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances, including multi-party lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services. While we do not believe that any of these suits will be material to us based upon present information, there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have, either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n​\nWe have also been named as a defendant in lawsuits where our products have not caused injuries, but the claimants wish to be monitored for potential future injuries. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such tort claims or the involvement we or our products might have in such matters in the future, and there can be no assurance that the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not require significant expenditures. In each of these chemical exposure cases, our insurance carriers have accepted the claims on our behalf (with or without reservation) and our financial exposure should be limited to the amount of our deductible; however, we cannot predict the number of claims that we may have to defend in the future and we may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance.\n​\nOur worldwide net expenditures for contamination remediation were approximately $0.7 million in 2024, $0.3 million in 2023 and $1.4 million in 2022. Our worldwide accruals at December 31, 2024 for probable future remediation expenditures, excluding potential insurance reimbursements, totaled approximately $19.6 million. We review our exposure for contamination remediation costs periodically and our accruals are adjusted as considered appropriate. While the final resolution of these issues could result in costs below or above current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period, we believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \n​\n​\nAvailable Information.\n​\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC at https://www.sec.gov.\n​\nGeneral information about us, including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments and exhibits to those reports, are available free of charge through our website at https://investor.ecolab.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with, or furnish them to, the SEC.\n​\nIn addition, the following governance materials are available on our web site at https://investor.ecolab.com/governance/corporate-governance: (i) charters of the Audit, Compensation & Human Capital Management, Finance, Governance, and Safety, Health & Environment Committees of our Board of Directors; (ii) our Board's Corporate Governance Principles; and (iii) our Code of Conduct.\n​\nWe include our website addresses throughout this report for reference only.

These statements include expectations concerning items such as:\n​\n\n●   amount, funding and timing of cash expenditures relating to our restructuring and other initiatives, as well as savings from such initiatives\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   future cash flows, access to capital, targeted credit rating metrics and impact of credit rating downgrade\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   adequacy of cash reserves\n-----------------------------\n\n●   uses for cash, including dividends, share repurchases, debt repayments, capital investments and strategic business acquisitions\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   global economic and political environment\n---------------------------------------------\n\n●   long-term potential of our business\n---------------------------------------\n\n●   impact of changes in exchange rates and interest rates, including the assessment and management of associated risks\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   customer retention rate\n---------------------------\n\n●   bad debt experience, non-performance of counterparties and losses due to concentration of credit risk\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   disputes, claims and litigation\n-----------------------------------\n\n●   environmental contingencies\n-------------------------------\n\n●   impact and cost of complying with laws and regulations\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   sustainability targets\n--------------------------\n\n●   returns on pension plan assets\n----------------------------------\n\n●   contributions to pension and postretirement healthcare plans\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   amortization expense\n------------------------\n\n●   impact of new accounting pronouncements\n-------------------------------------------\n\n●   income taxes, including tax attributes, valuation allowances, unrecognized tax benefits, permanent reinvestment assertions and goodwill deductibility\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   recognition of share-based compensation expense\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n●   payments under operating leases\n-----------------------------------\n\n●   future benefit plan payments\n--------------------------------\n\n●   market position\n-------------------\n​\nWithout limiting the foregoing, words or phrases such as “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will be,” “will continue,” “is anticipated,” “we believe,” “we expect,” “estimate,” “project” (including the negative or variations thereof), “intends,” “could,” or similar terminology, generally identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may also represent challenging goals for us. These statements, which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning various future events, are based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those of such forward-looking statements. We caution that undue reliance should not be placed on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. For a further discussion of these and other factors which could cause results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statement, see Item 1A of this Form 10-K, entitled “Risk Factors.” Except as may be required under applicable law, we undertake no duty to update our forward-looking statements.\n​\nForward-looking and other statements in this document may also address our sustainability initiatives, goals, targets and progress, and the inclusion of such statements is not an indication that these contents are necessarily material to investors or required to be disclosed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future and performance against our goals and targets may differ from such forward-looking statements in such event.\n​\n​\n\n\n15",

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n​\nThe following are important factors which could affect our financial performance and could cause our actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Form 10-K. See the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” set forth above. \n​\nWe may also refer to this disclosure to identify factors that may cause results to differ materially from those expressed in other forward-looking statements including those made in oral presentations, including telephone conferences and/or webcasts open to the public.\n​\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\" and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before making an investment decision. The risks described below are not the only risks or uncertainties we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, or results of operations. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your original investment. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks and uncertainties described below.\n​\nAdditionally, macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, including public health crises, escalating global conflicts, supply chain disruptions, labor market constraints, rising rates of inflation and high interest rates may amplify many of the risks discussed below to which we are subject. The extent of the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, including public health crises, on our financial and operating performance depends significantly on the duration and severity of such macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact and any changes in consumer behaviors as a result thereof.\n​\nEconomic & Operational Risks\n​\nOur results are impacted by general worldwide economic factors.\n​\nOver the past year, global interest rates aimed at curbing inflation, as well as implications of geopolitical situations in Europe, the Middle East and China, have resulted in economic and demand uncertainty. Previously, the COVID pandemic, geopolitical instability and other global events have resulted in supply chain challenges, inflation, high interest rates, foreign currency exchange volatility, and volatility in global capital markets, which have affected our business and could have a material adverse impact on our business in the future. Countries such as Argentina and Turkey have experienced economic upheaval and similar upheaval in other countries with Ecolab operations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows by negatively impacting economic activity, including in our key end-markets, and by further weakening the local currency versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in reduced sales and earnings from our foreign operations, which are generated in the local currency, and then translated to U.S. dollars.\n​\nOur results depend upon the continued vitality of the markets we serve.\n​\nEconomic downturns, and in particular downturns in our larger markets including the foodservice, hospitality, travel, health care, food processing, refining, pulp and paper, mining and steel industries, can adversely impact our customers, and we may find it difficult to restore margins by maintaining pricing due to easing inflation from slowing economic growth. Recently, the war and energy crisis in Europe have resulted in a more challenging macroeconomic environment with significantly impacted costs and demand. Previously, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the demand for our products and services provided to customers in the full-service restaurant, hospitality, lodging and entertainment industries. In prior years, a weaker global economic environment has also negatively impacted certain of our other end-markets. During these periods of weaker economic activity, our customers and potential customers may reduce or discontinue their volume of purchases of cleaning and sanitizing products and water treatment and process chemicals, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\n​\nOur significant non-U.S. operations expose us to global economic, political and legal risks that could impact our profitability.\n​\nWe have significant operations outside the United States, including joint ventures and other alliances. We conduct business in more than 170 countries and, in 2024, approximately 47% of our net sales originated outside the United States. There are inherent risks in our international operations, including: \n​\n\n●   exchange controls and currency restrictions;\n------------------------------------------------\n\n●   currency fluctuations and devaluations;\n-------------------------------------------\n\n●   tariffs and trade barriers;\n-------------------------------\n\n●   export duties and quotas;\n-----------------------------\n\n●   changes in the availability and pricing of raw materials, energy and utilities;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in local economic conditions;\n-----------------------------------------\n\n●   changes in laws and regulations, including the imposition of economic or trade sanctions affecting international commercial transactions;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   difficulties in managing international operations and the burden of complying with international and foreign laws;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   requirements to include local ownership or management in our business;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   economic and business objectives that differ from those of our joint venture partners;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n16\n\n\n\n\n●   exposure to possible expropriation, nationalization or other government actions;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   unsettled political conditions, military action, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, force majeure, war or other armed conflict, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict and other hostilities in the Middle East; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   countries whose governments have been hostile to U.S.-based businesses.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nFollowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the United States’ and other countries’ sanctions against Russia, we have limited our Russian business to operations that are essential to life, providing minimal support for our healthcare, life sciences, food and beverage and certain water businesses, and we may further narrow our presence in Russia depending on developments in the conflict or otherwise. While our operations in Russia and areas experiencing conflict are not material to our business and financial results, the escalation of these conflicts, or the imposition of additional sanctions by the United States, may also heighten many other risks disclosed in our report on Form 10-K, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including increased inflation, constraints on the availability of commodities, supply chain disruption and decreased business spending; disruptions to our or our business partners’ global technology infrastructure, including through cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; claims, litigation and regulatory enforcement; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy; terrorist activities; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; reputational risk; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets.\n​\nAdditionally, changes in international trade policies by governments around the world, including the imposition or continuation of tariffs, could materially and adversely affect our business. In 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs on certain imports from China and other countries, resulting in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. In February 2025, the U.S. proposed a 25% additional tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% additional tariff on imports from China. These tariffs, any new tariffs or policies imposed by governments around the world, or any resulting retaliatory measures, to the extent implemented, could increase our costs, reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations.\n​\nFurther, our operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and non-U.S. laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, as well as U.S. and non-U.S. economic sanctions regulations. We have internal policies and procedures relating to such laws and regulations; however, there is risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the misconduct or reckless acts of employees or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Violations of such laws and regulations could result in disruptive investigations, significant fines and sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n​\nAlso, because of uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of laws and regulations and the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights, we face risks in some countries that our intellectual property rights and contract rights would not be enforced by local governments. We are also periodically faced with the risk of economic uncertainty, which has impacted our business in some countries. Other risks in international business also include difficulties in staffing and managing local operations, including managing credit risk to local customers and distributors.\n​\nOur overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social, legal and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n​\nWe may experience business disruption if we fail to execute organizational change and management transitions.\n​\nOur continued success will depend on the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and certain other key employees, particularly those with sales and sales management responsibilities, to drive business growth, development and profitability. Our operations could be materially and adversely affected if for any reason we are unable to successfully execute organizational change and management transitions at leadership levels.\n​\nWe are subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\n​\nWe rely to a large extent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. The size and complexity of our information technology systems and those of strategic vendors make them vulnerable to failure, malicious intrusion and random attack. Acquisitions have resulted in further de-centralization of systems and additional complexity in our systems infrastructure. Likewise, data security breaches by employees or others with permitted access to our systems or to the systems of strategic vendors pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks. While we have continually matured our security program and capabilities and have had no material incidents to date, cyber threats continue to evolve and there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent cybersecurity attacks or breaches in our systems or in the systems of strategic vendors, including cloud providers, that could cause reputational damage, business disruption or legal and regulatory costs; could result in third-party claims; could result in compromise or misappropriation of our intellectual property, trade secrets or sensitive information; or could otherwise materially adversely affect our business, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Certain of our customer offerings include digital components, such as remote monitoring of certain customer operations. A breach of those remote monitoring systems could expose customer data giving rise to potential third-party claims and reputational damage. There may be other related challenges and risks as we complete implementation of our ERP system upgrade.\n​\n\n\n17\n\n\n\nOur results could be materially and adversely affected by difficulties in securing the supply of certain raw materials or by fluctuations in the cost of raw materials.\n​\nThe prices of raw materials used in our business fluctuate, and in recent years we have experienced periods of significant increased raw material costs. Changes in raw material prices, unavailability of adequate and reasonably priced raw materials or substitutes for those raw materials, or the inability to obtain or renew supply agreements on favorable terms has materially and adversely affected our business and can in the future materially and adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, volatility and disruption in economic activity and conditions could disrupt or delay the performance of our suppliers and thus impact our ability to obtain raw materials at favorable prices or on favorable terms, which may materially and adversely affect our business.\n​\nOur increasing reliance on artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies in our products, services, and operations presents several risks that could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n​\nWe are increasingly incorporating AI capabilities into the development of technologies and our business operations, and into our products and services. AI technology is complex and rapidly evolving, and may subject us to significant competitive, legal, regulatory, operational and other risks, including the following:\n​\n\n●   Operational and Technical Risks: AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving. Flaws in AI algorithms, training methodologies, or datasets may lead to unintended consequences, such as operational disruptions, erroneous decision-making, or data loss. These issues could impair the effectiveness of our AI systems and result in significant operational challenges. Additionally, software we purchase or lease from third-party vendors could become inoperable (via attack from a bad actor, network failure, code error, etc.), such that it adversely impacts Ecolab’s ability to deliver products or services to its customers, resulting in financial losses, legal liabilities, and damages to our reputation.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Legal and Regulatory Risks: The legal and regulatory landscape for AI is still developing and varies across jurisdictions. Compliance with evolving AI regulations may impose significant costs, limit our ability to incorporate AI capabilities, and expose us to legal liabilities. Additionally, new regulations could conflict with our current AI practices, requiring costly changes to our development and deployment strategies.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Reputational Risks: The use of AI raises social and ethical concerns, which could harm our reputation if not managed responsibly. Incidents related to AI, such as biased outcomes or privacy breaches, could lead to negative publicity and reduce public trust in our AI solutions.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Competitive Risks: Our competitors may develop and implement AI technologies more effectively, gaining a competitive advantage. If we fail to keep pace with advancements in AI, our market position could be weakened, adversely affecting our business performance.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Financial Risks: The development, testing, and deployment of AI systems are resource-intensive and may increase our operational costs. There is no assurance that our investments in AI will yield the anticipated benefits or that customers will adopt our AI-enhanced offerings, potentially impacting our financial results.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Cybersecurity Risks: AI systems can be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, such as data breaches and unauthorized access. These threats could result in financial losses, legal liabilities, and damage to our reputation.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nWe are committed to developing and using AI responsibly, but there can be no guarantee that we will successfully mitigate all associated risks. Any failure in our AI initiatives could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n​\nSevere public health outbreaks not limited to COVID-19 may adversely impact our business.\n​\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a rapid and significant negative impact on the global economy, including a significant downturn in the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries. Measures taken to alleviate the pandemic (such as stay-at-home orders and other responsive measures) significantly impacted our restaurant and hospitality customers and negatively affected demand for our products and services in these segments, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Besides the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, public health outbreaks such as Zika virus, Avian Flu, SARS and H1N1 influenza. A prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease such as these could result in a significant downturn in the foodservice, hospitality and travel industries and also may result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end markets. Any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and materially and adversely affect our business.\n​\n\n\n18\n\n\n\nStrategic Risks\n​\nIf we are unsuccessful in integrating acquisitions our business could be materially and adversely affected.\n​\nWe seek to acquire complementary businesses as part of our long-term strategy. There can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or succeed at effectively managing the integration of acquired businesses. If the underlying business performance of such acquired businesses deteriorates, the expected synergies from such transactions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate new businesses into our existing businesses, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n​\nIf we are unsuccessful in executing on key business initiatives, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\n​\nWe continue to execute key business initiatives as part of our ongoing efforts to improve our efficiency and returns. In particular, we are making supply chain investments to secure supply and add new capacity in our Life Sciences business. Additionally, we are continuing implementation of our ERP system upgrades, which are expected to continue in phases over the next several years. These upgrades, which include sales, supply chain and certain finance functions, are expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transactional processes. These upgrades involve complex business process design and a failure of certain of these processes could result in business disruption. We are also undertaking restructuring programs including the One Ecolab initiative leveraging our digital technologies to realign the functional work done in many countries into global centers of excellence. This program is discussed along with other restructuring activities under Note 3 of this Form 10-K. If the projects in which we are investing or the initiatives which we are pursuing are not successfully executed, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could materially and adversely be affected.\n​\nOur growth depends upon our ability to compete successfully with respect to value, innovation and customer support.\n​\nWe have numerous global, national, regional and local competitors. Our ability to compete depends in part on providing high quality and high value-added products, technology and service. We must also continue to identify, develop and commercialize innovative, profitable and high value-added products for niche applications and commercial digital applications. We have made significant investments in commercial digital product offerings, and our culture and expertise must continue to evolve to develop, support and profitably deploy commercial digital offerings, which are becoming an increasingly important part of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish our technology development goals or that technological developments by our competitors, including in the area of artificial intelligence, will not place certain of our products, technology or services at a competitive disadvantage in the future. In addition, certain of the new products that we have under development will be offered in markets in which we do not currently compete, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in those new markets. If we fail to introduce new technologies or commercialize our digital offerings on a timely and profitable basis, we may lose market share and our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n​\nConsolidation of our customers and vendors could materially and adversely affect our results.\n​\nCustomers and vendors in the foodservice, hospitality, travel, healthcare, energy, life sciences, food processing and pulp and paper industries, as well as other industries we serve, have consolidated in recent years and that trend may continue. This consolidation could have a material adverse impact on our ability to retain customers and on our pricing, margins and consolidated results of operations.\n​\nWe enter into multi-year contracts with customers that could impact our results.\n​\nOur multi-year contracts with some of our customers include terms affecting our pricing flexibility. There can be no assurance that these restraints will not have a material adverse impact on our margins and consolidated results of operations.\n​\nLegal, Regulatory & Compliance Risks\n​\nOur business depends on our ability to comply with laws and governmental regulations and meet our contractual commitments and failure to do so could materially and adversely impact our business; and we may be materially and adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\n​\nOur business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the environment, including evolving climate change standards, and to the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and use of our products as well as to the conduct of our business generally, including employment and labor laws and anti-corruption laws. Furthermore, increasing public and governmental awareness and concern regarding the effects of climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions and will likely result in further environmental and climate change laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations exposes us to potential financial liability and increases our operating costs. A violation of these laws and regulations could expose us to financial liability that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Regulation of our products and operations continues to increase with more stringent standards, causing increased costs of operations and potential for liability if a violation occurs. The potential cost to us relating to environmental and product registration laws and regulations is uncertain due to factors such as the unknown magnitude and type of possible contamination and clean-up costs, the complexity and evolving nature of laws and regulations, and the timing and expense of compliance. Changes to current laws (including tax laws), regulations and policies could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Changes to labor and employment laws and regulations, as well as related rulings by courts and administrative bodies, could materially and adversely affect our operations and expose us to potential financial liability.\n\n\n19\n\n\n\nDefense of litigation, particularly certain types of actions such as antitrust, patent infringement, personal injury, product liability, breach of contract, wage hour and class action lawsuits, can be costly and time consuming even if ultimately successful, and if not successful could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n​\nA chemical spill or release could materially and adversely impact our business. \n​\nAs a manufacturer and supplier of chemical products, there is a potential for chemicals to be accidentally spilled, released or discharged, either in liquid or gaseous form, during production, transportation, storage or use. Such a release could result in environmental contamination as well as a human or animal health hazard. Accordingly, such a release could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n​\nPotential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the separation and split-off of our Upstream Energy business could materially and adversely affect our business and financial statements.\n​\nWith respect to the separation and subsequent split-off of our Upstream Energy business, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with ChampionX Holding Inc. and ChampionX Corporation (f/k/a Apergy Corporation and taken together with ChampionX Holding Inc., “ChampionX”) as well as certain other agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and our relationship with ChampionX going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and certain other obligations of each party and could lead to disputes between ChampionX and us. If we are required to indemnify ChampionX under the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial related liabilities. In addition, with respect to the liabilities for which ChampionX has agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the indemnity rights we have against ChampionX will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that ChampionX will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business and our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n​\nExtraordinary events may significantly impact our business.\n​\nThe occurrence of (a) litigation or claims, (b) the loss or insolvency of a major customer or distributor, (c) repeated or prolonged federal government shutdowns or similar events, (d) war (including acts of terrorism or hostilities which impact our markets), (e) natural or manmade disasters, (f) water shortages or (g) severe weather conditions affecting our operations or the energy, foodservice, hospitality and travel industries may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n​\nWhile we have a diverse customer base and no customer or distributor constitutes 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues, we do have customers and independent, third-party distributors, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for the affected earnings periods. \n​\nGovernment shutdowns can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows by disrupting or delaying new product launches, renewals of registrations for existing products and receipt of import or export licenses for raw materials or products.\n​\nWar (including acts of terrorism or hostilities), natural or manmade disasters, water shortages or severe weather conditions, including the effects of climate change, affecting the energy, foodservice, hospitality, travel, health care, food processing, pulp and paper, mining, steel and other industries can cause a downturn in the business of our customers, which in turn can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In particular, the U.S. Gulf Coast is a region with significant refining, petrochemicals and chemicals operations which provide us raw materials, as well as being an important customer base for our Water operating segment. Hurricanes or other severe weather events impacting the Gulf Coast, such as the winter freeze in Texas and the Gulf Coast in February 2021, can materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable cost, or at all, and could adversely affect our business with our customers in the region.\n​\nOur commitments, goals, targets, objectives and initiatives related to sustainability, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks.\n​\nWe have developed, and will continue to establish, goals, targets, and other objectives related to sustainability matters, including our sustainability goals in alignment with the United Nations Global Compact’s Business Ambition for 1.5⁰C and our commitments to science-based targets addressing Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, discussed in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K, entitled “Business.” Achieving these goals and commitments will require evolving our business, capital investment and the development of technology that might not currently exist. We might incur additional expense or be required to recognize impairment charges in connection with our efforts. These commitments, goals, targets and other objectives reflect our current plans and there is no guarantee that they will be achieved. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these commitments, goals, targets, and objectives expose us to operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated commitment, goal, target, or objective is subject to factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control, including the pace of changes in technology, the availability of requisite financing, and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards.\n​\nOur business may face increased scrutiny from the investment community, other stakeholders, regulators, and the media related to our sustainability activities, including our commitments, goals, targets, and objectives, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, or as an acquiror could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our commitments, goals, targets, and objectives, to \n\n\n20\n\n\n\ncomply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have operational, reputational, financial and legal impacts.\n​\nFinancial Risks\n​\nIf the separation and split-off of our Upstream Energy business or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the divestiture are determined to be taxable in whole or in part, we and our stockholders may incur significant tax liabilities.\n​\nIn connection with the separation and split-off of our Upstream Energy business that was consummated on June 3, 2020, we obtained opinions of outside tax counsel that the related merger and exchange offer will qualify as tax-free transactions to us and our stockholders, except to the extent that cash was paid to Ecolab stockholders in lieu of fractional shares. We have not sought or obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on the tax consequences of these transactions. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, which may disagree with the opinion. Even if the merger and exchange offer otherwise qualified as tax-free transactions, they may become taxable to us if certain events occur that affect either Ecolab or ChampionX Corporation. While ChampionX Corporation has agreed not to take certain actions that could cause the transactions not to qualify as tax-free transactions and is generally obligated to indemnify us against any tax consequences if it breaches this agreement, the potential tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us if we were not entitled to indemnification or if the indemnification obligations were not fulfilled. If the merger or exchange offer were determined to be taxable, we could be subject to a substantial tax liability, and each U.S. holder of our common stock who participated in the exchange offer could be treated as exchanging the Ecolab shares surrendered for ChampionX Corporation shares in a taxable transaction.\n​\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could materially and adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.\n​\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. We are also impacted by actions taken to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which represents a coalition of member countries, and the European Commission which influence tax policies in countries where we operate. In particular, the OECD has coordinated negotiations among more than 140 jurisdictions with the goal of achieving consensus on various substantial changes to the international tax framework, including a 15% global minimum taxation regime (“Pillar Two”). Pillar Two took effect in several jurisdictions in which we operate starting in 2024 and will increase the burden and costs of our tax compliance. We continue to monitor these legislative developments, which based on information available, have not had material impacts to the 2024 financial statements. In addition, we are impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by the IRS or other taxing authorities in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\n​\nFuture events may impact our deferred tax position, including the utilization of foreign tax credits and undistributed earnings of international affiliates that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n​\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for deferred tax liabilities based on available evidence. This process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between future projected operating performance and actual results. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this determination, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence as of the end of each reporting period. Future adjustments (either increases or decreases), to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance are determined based upon changes in the expected realization of the net deferred tax assets. The realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carry-back or carry-forward periods under the tax law. Due to significant estimates used to establish the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Changes to the valuation allowance or the amount of deferred tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. Further, should we change our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of the undistributed earnings of international affiliates, a deferred tax liability may need to be established.\n\n​\nOur indebtedness may limit our operations and our use of our cash flow, and any failure to comply with the covenants that apply to our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial statements.\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $7.6 billion in outstanding indebtedness, with approximately $1.5 billion in the form of floating rate debt. Our debt level and related debt service obligations may have negative consequences, including:\n​\n\n●   requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes such as acquisitions and capital investment;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\n\n●   reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions;\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\n\n●   exposing us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates. For example, a one percentage point increase in the average interest rate on our floating rate debt at December 31, 2024 would increase future interest expense by approximately $15 million per year; and\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\n\n●   increasing our cost of funds and materially and adversely affecting our liquidity and access to the capital markets should we fail to maintain the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n​\nIf we add new debt, the risks described above could increase.\n\n\n21\n\n\n\nWe incur significant expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and may be required to report losses resulting from the impairment of goodwill or other assets recorded in connection with the Nalco and Purolite transactions and other acquisitions. \n​\nWe expect to continue to complete selected acquisitions and joint venture transactions in the future. In connection with acquisition and joint venture transactions, applicable accounting rules generally require the tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business to be recorded on the balance sheet of the acquiring company at their fair values. Intangible assets other than goodwill are required to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and this expense may be significant. Any excess in the purchase price paid by the acquiring company over the fair value of tangible and intangible assets of the acquired business is recorded as goodwill. If it is later determined that the anticipated future cash flows from the acquired business may be less than the carrying values of the assets and goodwill of the acquired business, the assets or goodwill may be deemed to be impaired. In this case, the acquiring company may be required under applicable accounting rules to write down the value of the assets or goodwill on its balance sheet to reflect the extent of the impairment. This write-down of assets or goodwill is generally recognized as a non-cash expense in the statement of operations of the acquiring company for the accounting period during which the write down occurs. As of December 31, 2024, we had goodwill of $7.9 billion which is maintained in various reporting units, including goodwill from the Nalco and Purolite transactions. If we determine that any of the assets or goodwill recorded in connection with the Nalco and Purolite transactions or any other prior or future acquisitions or joint venture transactions have become impaired, we will be required to record a loss resulting from the impairment. Impairment losses could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.\n​\n​",
