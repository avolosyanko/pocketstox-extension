      "text": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nBioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BioMarin, we, us or our) is a global biotechnology company dedicated to translating the promise of genetic discovery into medicines that make a profound impact on the life of each patient. The San Rafael, California-based company, founded in 1997, has a proven track record of innovation with eight commercial therapies and a strong clinical and preclinical pipeline. Using a distinctive approach to drug discovery and development, BioMarin pursues treatments that offer new possibilities for patients and families around the world navigating rare or difficult to treat genetic conditions. \nRecent Developments\nIn 2024, we achieved $2.9 billion in total revenues, including a significant contribution from our ongoing expansion of VOXZOGO, and we continued making important advancements in our product development pipeline. In the first half of 2024, we focused on value creation through working to accelerate growth, optimize efficiencies and drive operational excellence, including progress in executing on key strategic priorities first outlined in January 2024. We also completed a strategic portfolio assessment of research and development programs to determine which we believe have the strongest combination of scientific merit, opportunity for commercial success and potential value creation for stockholders. In September 2024, we held an Investor Day, during which we provided an overview of our new corporate strategy focused on innovation, growth, and value commitment. Our new strategy includes, among other things, our plans to expand VOXZOGO for the treatment of conditions beyond achondroplasia, our initiatives to drive sustained growth of the Enzyme Therapies portfolio (ALDURAZYME, BRINEURA, NAGLAZYME, PALYNZIQ and VIMIZIM), and our decision to focus on the United States (U.S.), Germany and Italy with respect to ROCTAVIAN. We also announced our updated commercial organizational model, which starting in 2025, is structured around three business units: Skeletal Conditions, Enzyme Therapies and ROCTAVIAN. Please see the disclosures below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these recent developments.\nCommercial Products\n\nCommercial Products                          Indication                                              2024 Net Product Revenues (in millions of U.S. Dollars)\nVIMIZIM (elosulfase alpha)                   Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IVA                                                     $739.8                     \nVOXZOGO (vosoritide)                         Achondroplasia                                                                      $735.1                     \nNAGLAZYME (galsulfase)                       MPS VI                                                                              $479.6                     \nPALYNZIQ (pegvaliase-pqpz)                   Phenylketonuria (PKU)                                                               $355.0                     \nALDURAZYME (laronidase)                      MPS I                                                                               $183.9                     \nBRINEURA (cerliponase alfa)                  Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2)                                        $169.1                     \nKUVAN (sapropterin dihydrochloride)          PKU                                                                                 $120.9                     \nROCTAVIAN (valoctocogene roxaparvovec)       Severe Hemophilia A                                                                  $26.0                     \nVIMIZIM \nVIMIZIM is an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of MPS IVA, a lysosomal storage disorder. MPS IVA is a disease characterized by deficient activity of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase (GALNS) causing excessive lysosomal storage of certain complex carbohydrates known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. This excessive storage causes a systemic skeletal dysplasia, short stature, and joint abnormalities, which limit mobility and endurance. Malformation of the chest impairs respiratory function, and looseness of joints in the neck cause spinal instability and potentially spinal cord compression. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, corneal clouding, and heart disease. Initial symptoms often become evident in the first five years of life. The disease substantially limits both the quality and length of life of those affected. \nVIMIZIM is approved for marketing in the U.S., the European Union (EU) and other international markets.\nVOXZOGO\nVOXZOGO is a once daily injection analog of C-type Natriuretic Peptide (CNP) for the treatment of achondroplasia, the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans. In patients with achondroplasia, endochondral bone growth, an essential process by which bone tissue is created, is negatively regulated due to a gain of function mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3). VOXZOGO acts as a positive regulator of the signaling pathway downstream of FGFR3 to promote endochondral bone growth.\nVOXZOGO is approved for marketing in the U.S. and Japan for the treatment of achondroplasia in children with open growth plates of all ages, in the EU for the treatment of children with open growth plates aged four months and older, and in other markets, including Australia and Brazil, for patients in various age ranges.\nWe continue to research VOXZOGO’s safety and effectiveness in children with achondroplasia while also advancing development across our CANOPY clinical program with VOXZOGO for the treatment of conditions beyond achondroplasia, including hypochondroplasia, idiopathic short stature, Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, and SHOX deficiency. Please see “Research and Development Programs – VOXZOGO” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nPlease see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks related to VOXZOGO in the U.S. and international markets.\nNAGLAZYME\nNAGLAZYME is a recombinant form of N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase (arylsulfatase B) indicated for patients with MPS VI. MPS VI is a debilitating life-threatening genetic disease for which no other drug treatment currently exists and is caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase B, an enzyme normally required for the breakdown of GAGs. Patients with MPS VI typically become progressively worse and experience multiple severe and debilitating symptoms resulting from the build-up of carbohydrate residues in tissues in the body. These symptoms include: inhibited growth, spinal cord compression, enlarged liver and spleen, joint deformities and reduced range of motion, skeletal deformities, impaired cardiovascular function, upper airway obstruction, reduced pulmonary function, frequent ear and lung infections, impaired hearing and vision, sleep apnea, malaise and reduced endurance.\nNAGLAZYME is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets.\nPALYNZIQ\nPALYNZIQ is a PEGylated recombinant phenylalanine (Phe) ammonia lyase enzyme, which is delivered through subcutaneous injection to reduce blood Phe concentrations. PALYNZIQ is our second approved treatment for PKU. PKU is caused by a deficiency of activity of an enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), which is required for the metabolism of Phe. Phe is an essential amino acid found in all protein-containing foods. Without sufficient quantity or activity of PAH, Phe accumulates to abnormally high levels in the blood, resulting in a variety of serious neurological complications, including severe mental retardation and brain damage, mental illness, seizures and other cognitive problems. As a result of newborn screening efforts implemented in the 1960s and early 1970s, virtually all PKU patients under the age of 40 in developed countries have been diagnosed at birth. PKU can be managed by a Phe-restricted diet, which is supplemented by nutritional replacement products, like formulas and specially manufactured foods; however, it is difficult for most patients to adhere to the strict diet to the extent needed for achieving adequate control of blood Phe levels.\nPALYNZIQ is approved for marketing in the U.S. for adult patients with PKU who have uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L on existing management. PALYNZIQ is also approved for marketing in the EU, Australia, and Brazil for patients ages 16 and older who have inadequate blood Phe control (blood Phe concentrations greater than 600 micromol/L) despite prior management with available treatment options.\nIn the U.S., PALYNZIQ is only available through the PALYNZIQ Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program, which is required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to mitigate the risk of anaphylaxis while using the product. Notable requirements of our REMS program include the following:\n•prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the REMS program and completing training;\n•prescribers must prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine with PALYNZIQ;\n•pharmacies must be certified with the REMS program and must dispense PALYNZIQ only to patients who are authorized to receive it;\n•patients must enroll in the REMS program and be educated about the risk of anaphylaxis by a certified prescriber to ensure they understand the risks and benefits of treatment with PALYNZIQ; and\n•patients must have auto-injectable epinephrine available at all times while taking PALYNZIQ.\nWe are also seeking to expand PALYNZIQ into the 12 to 17 age group and completed enrollment of the Phase 3 study in 2024. \nPlease see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks posed by the REMS program.\nBRINEURA\nBRINEURA is a recombinant human tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) for the treatment of patients with CLN2, a form of Batten disease. CLN2 is an incurable, rapidly progressive disease that typically ends in patient death by 10-12 years of age. Patients are initially healthy but begin to decline at approximately the age of three. BRINEURA is the first treatment approved to slow the progression of loss of ambulation in children with CLN2 disease and was one of the first therapies to go through an accelerated review procedure in the EU.\nBRINEURA is administered via intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion and intended to be used in combination with a delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. Please see “Government Regulation – Regulation of Approved Products – Combination Products and Companion Diagnostics” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on combination products.\nBRINEURA is approved for marketing in the U.S. and in the EU for children of all ages and in other international markets.\nALDURAZYME\nALDURAZYME is a highly purified protein that is designed to be identical to a naturally occurring form of the human enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, a lysosomal enzyme normally required for the breakdown of GAGs. MPS I is a progressive and debilitating life-threatening genetic disease that is caused by the deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. Patients with MPS I typically become progressively worse and experience multiple severe and debilitating symptoms resulting from the build-up of carbohydrate residues in all tissues in the body. These symptoms include: inhibited growth, delayed and regressed mental development (in the severe form of the disease), enlarged liver and spleen, joint deformities and reduced range of motion, impaired cardiovascular function, upper airway obstruction, reduced pulmonary function, frequent ear and lung infections, impaired hearing and vision, sleep apnea, malaise and reduced endurance.\nWe developed ALDURAZYME through collaboration with Sanofi. Under our collaboration agreement with Sanofi, we are responsible for manufacturing ALDURAZYME and supplying it to Sanofi. We receive payments ranging from 39.5% to 50% on worldwide net ALDURAZYME sales by Sanofi depending on sales volume. Sanofi and BioMarin are members of BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, a 50/50 limited liability company (the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC) that: (1) holds the intellectual property relating to ALDURAZYME and other collaboration products and licenses all such intellectual property on a royalty-free basis to Sanofi and BioMarin to allow us to exercise our rights and perform our obligations under the agreements related to the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, and (2) engages in research and development activities that are mutually selected and funded by Sanofi and us.\nALDURAZYME is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets. \nKUVAN\nKUVAN is a proprietary synthetic oral form of 6R-BH4, a naturally occurring enzyme co-factor for PAH, indicated for patients with PKU. KUVAN is the first drug for the treatment of PKU, which is an inherited metabolic disease. We believe that approximately 30% to 50% of those with PKU could benefit from treatment with KUVAN.\nKUVAN is approved for marketing in the U.S., the EU and other international markets (excluding Japan). In certain international markets, KUVAN is also approved for, or is only approved for, the treatment of primary BH4 deficiency, a different disorder than PKU.\nGeneric versions of KUVAN are available in several countries around the world, including multiple generic versions in the U.S. and the EU. Several generic versions of KUVAN have also been approved either centrally by the European Commission (EC) or on a country-by-country basis throughout the EU. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks posed by generic versions of KUVAN in the U.S. and international markets.\nROCTAVIAN \nROCTAVIAN is an adeno associated virus (AAV5) vector gene therapy designed to restore factor VIII plasma concentrations in patients with severe hemophilia A. Hemophilia A, also called factor VIII deficiency or classic hemophilia, is a genetic disorder caused by missing or defective factor VIII, a clotting protein. People living with hemophilia A are not able to form blood clots efficiently and are at risk for excessive bleeding from modest injuries, potentially endangering their lives. People with severe hemophilia often bleed spontaneously into their muscles or joints. \nROCTAVIAN was conditionally approved by the EC in August 2022 and approved by the FDA in the U.S. in June 2023. Please see “Government Regulation – Adaptive Pathways” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on conditional marketing authorizations.\nIn 2024, we announced that we will focus commercial, research and manufacturing activities in three prioritized countries, including the U.S., Germany and Italy as part of our updated ROCTAVIAN strategy.\nPlease see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks related to the commercialization of ROCTAVIAN.\nResearch and Development Programs\nWe have multiple clinical and preclinical product candidates in various stages of development that are intended to address the root causes of genetic conditions with a significant unmet medical need. Generally, our development programs have well-understood biology and provide an opportunity to be first-to-market or offer a substantial benefit over existing treatment options. A summary of our key clinical stage programs is provided below. \nVOXZOGO\nWe are advancing development across our CANOPY clinical program with VOXZOGO for the treatment of hypochondroplasia, idiopathic short stature, Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, and SHOX deficiency. In 2024, we began enrollment in the pivotal Phase 3 registration-enabling study for the treatment of hypochondroplasia.\nBMN 333\nBMN 333 is a longer-acting CNP in development for the treatment of multiple growth disorders, including achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia. We initiated the first-in-human study of BMN 333 in January 2025. \nBMN 349\nBMN 349 is an oral therapeutic in development for the treatment of liver disease associated with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. We completed the single-ascending dose phase of the first-in-human study and dosing in the multiple-ascending dose phase of the study began in December 2024. \nBMN 351\nBMN 351 is our next-generation oligonucleotide in development for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). We completed enrollment into the first and second dose cohorts in late 2024. \nManufacturing\nWe manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) for ALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME, PALYNZIQ, VOXZOGO, and ROCTAVIAN in our production facilities located in Novato, California. We also have a commercial-scale gene therapy manufacturing facility, located in Novato, California. We manufacture the API for BRINEURA and VIMIZIM in our manufacturing facility in Shanbally, Cork, Ireland. Our Novato and Shanbally facilities have been inspected and have demonstrated compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EC and health agencies in other countries. We also have installed aseptic filling and drug product packaging capabilities at the Shanbally site, which received EU approval in 2024. Additional regulatory inspections of this new drug product filling facility are planned and/or anticipated over the coming months.\nWe contract with third parties to manufacture PALYNZIQ and KUVAN API. Additionally, most of our drug product manufacturing (which includes vials, syringes, tablets, and powder) is performed externally by contract manufacturers. The volume mix will change as drug product filing operations initiate and expand in the Shanbally site. Packaging operations are effectively split between installed capacity at the Shanbally site and several contract manufacturers. We expect to continue to contract with outside service providers for certain manufacturing services, including drug substance, drug product, and packaging operations for our products. All of our facilities and those of any third-party manufacturers will be subject to periodic inspections confirming compliance with applicable law and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial sale. Third-party manufacturers’ facilities are subject to periodic inspections to confirm compliance with applicable law and must be cGMP certified. We believe that our current agreements with third-party manufacturers and suppliers provide for ample operating capacity to support the anticipated clinical and commercial demand for these products. In certain instances, there is only one approved contract manufacturer for certain aspects of the manufacturing process. In such cases, we attempt to prevent disruption of supplies through supply agreements, maintaining safety stock and other appropriate strategies.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials and supplies required to produce our products and product candidates are available in some instances from one supplier and in other instances from multiple suppliers. In those cases where raw materials are only available through one supplier, such supplier may be either a sole source (the only recognized supply source available to us) or a single source (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We have adopted policies to attempt, to the extent feasible, to minimize our raw material supply risks, including maintenance of greater levels of raw materials inventory and implementation of multiple raw materials sourcing strategies, especially for critical raw materials. Although to date we have not experienced any significant delays in obtaining any raw materials from our suppliers, we cannot provide assurance that we will not face shortages from one or more of them in the future. Please see the risk factor, “Supply interruptions may disrupt our inventory levels and the availability of our products and product candidates and cause delays in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, or harm our business by reducing our revenues.” described in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales and Marketing\nWe have established a commercial organization, which starting in 2025, is primarily structured around three business units: Skeletal Conditions, Enzyme Therapies and ROCTAVIAN. This organization, which includes a sales force, supports our product lines directly in the U.S., Europe, South America and certain other significant markets. For other selected markets, we have signed agreements with other companies to act as distributors of all our products, other than ALDURAZYME. Most of these agreements generally grant the distributor the right to market the product in the territory and the obligation to secure all necessary regulatory approvals for commercial or named patient sales. Additional markets are being assessed at this time and additional agreements may be signed in the future.\nSanofi has the exclusive right to distribute, market and sell ALDURAZYME globally and is required to purchase its requirements exclusively from us.\nIn the U.S., our products (other than ALDURAZYME) are marketed through our commercial teams, including sales representatives and supporting staff members, who promote our products directly to physicians in specialties appropriate for each product. Outside of the U.S., our sales representatives and supporting staff members market our products (other than ALDURAZYME). We believe that with moderate changes in 2025, including changes in connection with the reorganization of the commercial organization described above, the size of our sales force will be appropriate to effectively reach our target customers in markets where our products are directly marketed. The launch of any future products, if approved, will likely require expansion of our commercial organization, including our sales force, in the U.S. and international markets.\nWe utilize third-party logistics companies to store and distribute our products. Moreover, we use third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support-related services, to assist with our commercial activities. \nCustomers\nCustomers for our products (other than ALDURAZYME) include a limited number of specialty pharmacies and end-users, such as hospitals and non-U.S. government agencies. We also sell our products (other than ALDURAZYME) to our authorized distributors and to certain larger pharmaceutical wholesalers globally, which act as intermediaries between us and end-users and generally do not stock significant quantities of our products. However, in certain countries, governments place large periodic orders for our products. The timing of these orders can be inconsistent and can create significant quarter to quarter variation in our revenue. PALYNZIQ is currently distributed in the U.S. pursuant to the REMS program through a limited number of certified specialty pharmacies. During 2024, 25% of our net product revenue was generated by two customers. Sanofi is our sole customer for ALDURAZYME and is responsible for distributing, marketing, and selling ALDURAZYME to third parties.\nCompetition\nCommercial Products\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Within the industry, there are many public and private companies, including pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies that have or may soon initiate programs for the same indications that our products and product candidates are intended to treat. Furthermore, universities and non-profit research organizations may have research programs, both early-stage and clinical, in the same disease areas. Our larger competitors may have advantages over us due to greater financial or scientific resources, lower labor and other costs, or higher headcount and more robust organizational structures, while smaller competitors may have advantages over us due to lower overhead costs, being more nimble, or being able to focus on a narrower set of indications or development programs. Our competitors have considerable experience in drug manufacturing, preclinical and clinical research and development, regulatory affairs, marketing, sales, and distribution. They pursue broad patent portfolios and other intellectual property to protect the products they are developing. Their products may outcompete ours due to one or more factors, including faster progress through preclinical \nand clinical development, lower manufacturing costs, superior safety and efficacy, lower pricing, stronger patent protection, and better marketing, sales, and distribution capabilities. In this event, our products and product candidates, if approved, could fail to gain significant market share, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOther than ROCTAVIAN and KUVAN, as described below, our products have no direct approved competition currently on the market in the U.S. or the EU; however, other companies are in the development phase with new and generic products. Our products and product candidates have potential competition from products under development either using similar technology to our programs or different treatment strategies. The following is a summary of some of the primary possible future competitors for our products and product candidates, but the information below may not include all potential competition.\nVOXZOGO\nVOXZOGO, for the treatment of achondroplasia, could have competition from clinical stage products under development by Ascendis Pharma A/S, QED Therapeutics, Inc. (a subsidiary of BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.), Ribomic Inc., Tyra Biosciences Inc., and preclinical product candidates from other companies, including Abbisko Therapeutics Co Ltd, C-Biomex Co., Ltd, Changchun GeneScience Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Immunoforge, Co. Ltd., Novo Nordisk A/S, Peptron Inc., Prolynx Inc., and SiSaf Ltd. \nALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME, and VIMIZIM\nIn the mucopolysaccharidosis field, several companies are researching treatments using small molecules, gene therapy, and other novel technologies. ALDURAZYME, for the treatment of MPS I, has potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from ArmaGen, Inc., JCR Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd (acquired by ArmaGen, Inc.)., Orchard Therapeutics Plc and RegenxBio Inc. and earlier stage product candidates, including product candidates from Denali Therapeutics Inc. and Immusoft Corporation. NAGLAZYME, for the treatment of MPS VI, has potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from Inventiva S.A. and Paradigm Biopharmaceuticals Limited and other potential candidates in earlier stages. VIMIZIM, for the treatment of MPS IVA, has potential competition from preclinical product candidates from Esteve Pharmaceuticals, S.A., and RegenxBio Inc. and other potential candidates in earlier stages.\nBRINEURA\nBRINEURA, for the treatment of CLN2, has potential competition from preclinical product candidates from Lexeo Therapeutics, Inc., RegenxBio Inc. and the Roche Group.\nPALYNZIQ and KUVAN\nThere are currently no other approved, non-generic drugs on the market in the U.S. or the EU for the treatment of PKU. However, generic versions of KUVAN are available in several countries around the world, including multiple generic versions in the U.S. and the EU. Several generic versions of KUVAN have also been approved either centrally by the EC or on a country-by-country basis throughout the EU. Please see “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks posed by generic versions of KUVAN in the U.S. and international markets. PALYNZIQ and KUVAN also have potential competition from clinical stage product candidates from Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc., Jnana Therapeutics Inc. (a subsidiary of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), PTC Therapeutics, Inc., SOM Innovation Biotech, S.A., SChoia Pharma Inc., and Synlogic, Inc. and earlier stage product candidates, including, but not limited to, product candidates from Evox Therapeutics Limited, Tessera Therapeutics, Inc., and Pluvia Biotech. Other companies are also developing gene therapy product candidates for PKU.\nROCTAVIAN\nROCTAVIAN, a gene therapy for the treatment of adults with severe hemophilia A, has potential competition from marketed recombinant factor VIII replacement therapies, including products marketed by Bayer AG, CSL Behring, Novo Nordisk A/S, Pfizer, Inc., Sanofi S.A., and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, and a novel bispecific antibody marketed by the Roche Group. In addition, ASC Therapeutics, Inc., Pfizer, Inc., and the Roche Group are developing novel gene therapy product candidates, and the Roche Group and Sanofi S.A. are developing novel non-factor replacement product candidates for the treatment of hemophilia A.\nResearch and Development Programs\nVOXZOGO\nVOXZOGO, for the treatment of hypochondroplasia, could have competition from clinical stage products under development by Ascendis Pharma A/S and QED Therapeutics, Inc. (a subsidiary of BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.), and a preclinical product candidate from Tyra Biosciences Inc.\nVOXZOGO, for the treatment of idiopathic short stature could have competition from marketed branded and generic human growth hormones, clinical stage products (marketed for other indications) under development by Ascendis Pharma A/S, and Novo Nordisk A/S, and additional clinical stage products by Anhui Anke Biotechnology (Group) Co., Ltd. and Changchun GeneScience Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.\nVOXZOGO, for the treatment of Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, and SHOX deficiency could have competition from marketed branded and generic human growth hormones, clinical stage products (marketed for other indications) under development by Ascendis Pharma A/S and Novo Nordisk A/S, an additional clinical stage product from Changchun GeneScience Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., and a preclinical product candidate from Cavalry Biosciences.\nBMN 333\nBMN 333, for the treatment of achondroplasia could have competition from clinical stage products under development by Ascendis Pharma A/S, QED Therapeutics, Inc. (a subsidiary of BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.), Ribomic Inc., Tyra Biosciences Inc., and preclinical product candidates from other companies, including Abbisko Therapeutics Co Ltd, C-Biomex Co., Ltd, Changchun GeneScience Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Immunoforge, Co. Ltd., Novo Nordisk A/S, Peptron Inc., Prolynx Inc., and SiSaf Ltd. \nBMN 333, for the treatment of hypochondroplasia, could have competition from clinical stage products under development by Ascendis Pharma A/S and QED Therapeutics, Inc. (a subsidiary of BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.), and a preclinical product candidate from Tyra Biosciences Inc.\nBMN 349\nBMN 349, for the treatment of liver disease associated with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, could have competition from Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.\nBMN 351\nBMN 351, for the treatment of DMD, could have competition from marketed oligonucleotide and gene therapy products by Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., steroids by Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., PTC Therapeutics, Inc., and Santhera Pharmaceuticals Holdings AG, and an epigenetic therapy by Italfarmaco S.p.A. In addition, BMN 351 could have potential competition from clinical product candidates for exon 51 skipping amenable DMD by Dyne Therapeutics, Inc. and PepGen, Inc., and gene therapy product candidates from Regenxbio, Inc. and Solid Biosciences, Inc.\nPatents, Proprietary Rights and Regulatory Exclusivity\nOur success depends on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and also creates barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through: filing new patent applications; prosecuting existing applications; licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications; and pursuing, litigation, administrative challenges or other types of proceedings to protect our patents and intellectual property rights. For example, in January 2025, we initiated legal action against Ascendis Pharma A/S at the Unified Patent Court (UPC) in Munich, Germany, for infringement of our patent covering long-acting variants of CNP. Furthermore, we seek to protect our ownership of know-how, trade secrets and trademarks through an active program of legal mechanisms including registrations, assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations and licenses.\nU.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest application was filed. U.S. patents that were issued on applications filed before June 8, 1995, may be effective until 17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the 20-year date. In some cases, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic or, in the case of the U.S., because of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) delays in prosecuting the application. In the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act), a patent that covers a drug approved by the FDA may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to five years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The duration and extension of the term of foreign patents varies in accordance with local law. In the EU, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) are available to extend a patent term up to five years to compensate for patent protection lost during regulatory review. Although all EU Member States must provide SPCs, SPCs must be applied for and granted on a country-by-country basis. Limited exceptions apply to the protection conferred by the SPC.\nThe table below lists our active patents and patent applications of primary importance for our products other than ALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME and KUVAN by territory, general subject matter (including composition, methods of treatment and approved use, methods of production and purification, pharmaceutical compositions and clinical formulations) and latest expiry date. With respect to ALDURAZYME and NAGLAZYME, the last of our patents expired in November 2020 and November 2023, respectively. One or more patents with the same or earlier expiry dates may fall under the same general subject matter and are not listed separately in the table below. We continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the U.S. and other \nterritories covering various aspects of our products that may, if issued, extend patent exclusivity beyond the expiration dates listed in the table below.\n\nProduct                                         Territory                                                              Patent No(s).

candidates. Certain of our product candidates are in therapeutic areas that have been the subject of many years of extensive research and development by academic organizations and third parties who may control patents or other intellectual property that they might assert against us, should one or more of our product candidates in these therapeutic areas succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and thereafter be commercialized. We continually evaluate the intellectual property rights of others in these areas in order to determine whether a claim of infringement may be made by others against us. Should we determine that a third party has intellectual property rights that could impact our ability to freely market a compound we consider a number of factors in determining how best to prepare for the commercialization of any such product candidate. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the stage of development of our product candidate and whether we and our outside counsel believe the intellectual property rights of others are valid, whether we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, whether a license is available upon commercially reasonable terms, whether we will seek to challenge the intellectual property rights of others, and the likelihood of and liability resulting from an adverse outcome should we be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nGovernment Regulation\nRegulation by governmental authorities in the U.S., European countries and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, commercialization, pricing and reimbursement of our products. Our industry is subject to significant federal, state, local and non-U.S. regulation. Our products require approval from the FDA, the EC (on the basis of the scientific opinions issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)) and corresponding agencies in other countries before they can be marketed. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. and foreign requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (NDAs) or Biologics License Applications (BLAs), warning or untitled letters, investigations, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension or withdrawal of marketing, production or distribution authorizations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.\nApproval Process in the U.S. and EU\nSatisfaction of FDA and EU pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. and the EU typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the applicable regulatory agency of an application (e.g., an IND in the U.S. or a CTA in the EU), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which marketing approval is sought. On January 31, 2022, Regulation EU No 536/2014 (CTR) became fully \napplicable in the EU. The CTR established a centralized application procedure where one of the National Competent Authorities (NCA) of the Member States where the trial will take place takes the lead in reviewing certain aspects of the application, while the other NCAs have a lesser involvement than they had under the previous regime established by Directive 2001/20/EC (CTD). The CTD indeed introduced the first set of harmonized rules on clinical trials in the EU but resulted in a patchwork of different national regimes. The CTR was adopted with a view to introducing a more uniform set of the rules across the EU for the authorization of clinical trials. Such authorization still involves the national regulatory authorities and Ethics Committees of each of the EU Member States where the trial is to be conducted. However, the relevant procedures have now been streamlined with a view to facilitating a swifter and more seamless authorization and deployment of multi-center trials occurring in more than one EU Member State. More specifically, the CTR allows sponsors to rely on one single submission for CTAs regardless of the number of Member States where the trial takes place and based on a single harmonized application. Furthermore, under the CTR, deadlines for regulatory approvals are shortened with a view to accelerating the authorization process. The CTR also established an EU Portal which will act as a single-entry point for submission of data and information relating to clinical trials. Until January 30, 2025, the CTD will continue to apply in parallel to the CTR for a transitional period. From January 31, 2025 all trials will have to comply with the CTR.\nPreclinical tests include laboratory evaluation, as well as animal studies, to assess the characteristics and potential pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with FDA and/or EU and national regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices (GLP). The results of preclinical testing, along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol are reviewed by the applicable regulatory agency as part of an IND or CTA. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND or CTA is submitted. Until the CTA or IND is approved or becomes effective following a waiting period, and appropriate reviews have been satisfactorily completed by the applicable Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or Ethics Committees, we may not start the clinical trial in the relevant jurisdiction.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with applicable regulations, good clinical practices (GCP), as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and to the relevant regulatory agency in the EU as part of a new CTA.\nThe regulatory agencies may order the temporary halt or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if they believe that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB/Ethics Committee may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB/Ethics Committee’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials that are deployed to support NDAs, BLAs or Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Typically, we undertake a three-phase human clinical testing program as follows:\n•Phase 1 - the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness.\n•Phase 2 - usually involves trials in a limited patient population, to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations.\n•Phase 3 - undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites.\nAfter completion of the required clinical testing, an application is prepared and submitted to the applicable regulatory agency. Approval of the application by the applicable regulatory agency is required before marketing of the product may begin. In the European Economic Area (i.e., the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) (the EEA), there are two types of marketing authorizations (MA), namely: (i) the “Union” MA, which is issued by the EC through the so-called “centralized procedure”, based on the positive opinion of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), and results in a single marketing authorization that is valid across the EEA; and (ii) “National MAs,” which are issued by the competent NCAs and only cover their respective territory. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products such as: (i) medicinal products derived from certain biotechnology processes, (ii) designated orphan medicinal products, (iii) medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other auto-immune dysfunctions, viral diseases; and (iv) Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines). The NDA, BLA or MAA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing, a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls and proposed labeling, among other things. In the U.S., each NDA or BLA is subject to a significant user fee at the time of submission, unless a waiver is granted by the FDA. Similarly, in the EU, the submission of an MAA is subject to the payment of fees, a waiver of which may be obtained only under limited circumstances. The FDA and the EMA initially review the applications for a threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The regulatory agency may request additional information rather than accepting an application for filing or validation. Once the submission is accepted, the applicable agency begins an in-depth review. For the FDA, the review period for standard review applications for new molecular \nentities is typically ten months from the date the company files the application and, for priority review of drugs, that is, drugs that the FDA determines address a significant unmet need and represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, the review period is typically six months from the date the company files the application. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information submitted during the review or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. After the FDA evaluates the information provided in the NDA/BLA, it issues an approval letter, or a complete response letter. A complete response letter outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed and the NDA/BLA has been resubmitted, the FDA will re-initiate review. If it is satisfied that the deficiencies have been addressed, the FDA will issue an approval letter.\nUnder the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days. This excludes so-called clock stops, during which additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. At the end of the review period, the CHMP provides an opinion to the EC. If the opinion is favorable, the EC may then adopt a decision to grant marketing authorization. In the event of a negative opinion, the company may request a re-examination of the application within 15 days of receipt of the negative opinion. The company then has 60 days to provide the CHMP with detailed grounds for requesting the re-examination. Within 60 days of providing this information, the CHMP must re-examine its opinion. The EC follows the recommendation of the CHMP in almost all cases. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of an MAA in no more than 150 days. This is usually when the product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation.\nDuring the review period, the FDA and/or the European authorities may typically inspect one or more clinical sites and/or the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP regulations and may equally inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured to ensure compliance with cGMPs regulations. Neither the FDA nor the EC will approve the product unless compliance is satisfactory and the application contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.\nFast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval\nThe FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the FDA’s fast track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.\nIn addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drug’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.\nUnder the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug, including a fast track drug, for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of a Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit of the drug. Failure to conduct a required post-approval study with due diligence, including with respect to the conditions specified by the FDA, or confirm a clinical benefit through a post-marketing study will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA) added provisions related to the accelerated approval pathway. Pursuant to FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval. FDORA also requires the FDA to specify conditions of any required post-approval study, which may include milestones such as a target date of study completion and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval studies and any conditions required by the FDA not later than 180 days following approval and not less frequently than every 180 days thereafter until completion or termination of the study. FDORA enables the FDA to initiate enforcement action for \nthe failure to conduct with due diligence a required post-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.\nBreakthrough Therapy Designation\nThe FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.\nAdaptive Pathways\nThe EMA has an adaptive pathways approach which allows for early and progressive patient access to a medicine in cases of high medical need. To achieve this goal, several approaches are envisaged including for example identifying small populations with severe disease where a medicine’s benefit-risk balance could be favorable or making more use of real-world data where appropriate to support clinical trial data. The adaptive pathways concept applies primarily to treatments in areas of high medical need where it is difficult to collect data via traditional routes and where large clinical trials would unnecessarily expose patients who are unlikely to benefit from the medicine. The approach builds on regulatory processes already in place within the existing EU legal framework. These include: scientific advice; compassionate use; the conditional MA; patient registries and other pharmacovigilance tools that allow collection of real-life data and development of a risk-management plan for each medicine.\nA conditional MA may be granted prior to the submission of comprehensive clinical data if the benefit of the immediate availability on the market of the product is deemed to outweigh the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. In emergency situations, a MA for such medicinal products may be granted also where comprehensive pre-clinical or pharmaceutical data have not been provided. Under this procedure a MA can be granted as soon as sufficient data becomes available to demonstrate that the drug's benefits outweigh its risks, with safeguards and controls in place post-authorization. This procedure can also be combined with a rolling review of data during the development of a promising medicine, to further expedite its evaluation. Conditional MAs are typically subject to obligations that are reviewed annually. These include the obligation to complete ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, with a view to confirming that the risk-benefit balance is favorable. Conditional MAs are valid for one year and are renewable.\nPRIME Program\nThe EMA launched its PRIME regulatory program to enhance support for the development of therapies that target an unmet medical need. The initiative focuses on drugs that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients with no treatment options. These therapies are considered priority medicines within the EU. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early, proactive and enhanced support to drug developers to optimize the generation of robust data on a therapy’s benefits and risks and enable accelerated assessment of drug applications.\nRegulation of Approved Products \nProduct Marketing and Promotion\nA marketing approval authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The FDA and European authorities closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of commercial products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising (which is prohibited in the EU for prescription products such as our products), off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. For further detail, please see \"Post-Approval Regulatory Requirements\" below.\nRegulation of Manufacturing Standards\nThe FDA as well as other regulatory agencies around the world, regulate and inspect the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to granting approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA and other agencies such as the EC we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. We also must adhere to cGMP regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA and other regulatory agencies through their facilities inspection program. The FDA and other regulatory agencies around the world conduct regular, periodic visits to reinspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval.\nCombination Products and Companion Diagnostics\nCombination products are defined by the FDA as products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. For example, in the EU, if a device intended to administer a medicinal product is sold together with such medicinal product in such a way that they form a single integral product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, that single integral product is regulated as a medicinal product. In addition, the relevant general safety and performance requirements established for medical devices by EU medical devices legislation apply to the device component of such combination products. A number of our products qualify as combination products and are regulated under the applicable framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under such framework as well.\nIf use of an in vitro diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of a drug or biologic involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Approval and clearance of a companion diagnostic also requires a high level of coordination between the drug or biologic manufacturer and device manufacturer, if different companies. Most companion diagnostics require approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements.\nPost-Approval Regulatory Requirements\nFollowing approval, the FDA and the regulatory authorities around the world will impose certain post-approval requirements related to a product. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, such as special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Similar rules apply outside of the U.S. For example, products approved in the EU may be subject to post-authorization requirements such as the obligation to perform post-authorization efficacy studies (PAES) or post-authorization safety studies (PASS) imposed as conditions to the MA, or other Risk Minimization Measures (RMMs), such as educational programs or controlled access programs, which may sometimes vary from one EU Member State to another. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. Moreover, if a company obtains original approval for a product via an accelerated approval pathway, the company will be typically required to conduct a post-marketing confirmatory trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit in support of full approval. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study with due diligence could result in the withdrawal of the marketing approval for a product.\nCommercial products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require a submission to and approval by the FDA or the EC, as applicable, before the change can be implemented. An NDA/BLA, PMA, or MAA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and similar procedures and actions apply in reviewing NDA/BLA, PMA, or MAA supplements as in reviewing NDAs/BLAs, PMAs, and MAAs.\nAdverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following marketing approval. Either the FDA or the EC/EMA may also require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control as well as the manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug, device, and biological product manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, the EMA/NCAs, during which the inspectors audit manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, prescription drug manufacturers in the U.S. must comply with applicable provisions of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act and provide and receive product tracing information, maintain appropriate licenses, ensure they only work with other properly licensed entities and have procedures in place to identify and properly handle suspect and illegitimate products. Similarly, in the EU, stringent rules have been introduced to fight medicine falsifications and to ensure that the trade in medicines is subject to rigorous controls. Measures required to ensure that include: a unique identifier and an anti-tampering device on the outer packaging of drugs, stringent rules on import of active pharmaceutical ingredients and record-keeping requirements for wholesale distributors.\nApproval Regulation Outside of the U.S. and the EU\nFor marketing outside the U.S. and the EU, we are subject to non-U.S. regulatory requirements governing human clinical testing and marketing approval for our products. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, can differ from those in the U.S. and the EU and may require us to perform additional preclinical or clinical testing. The amount of time required to obtain necessary approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or EC approval. In many countries outside of the U.S., approvals for pricing, coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans, are also required.\nOther Regulation\nExclusivity for Biologics in the U.S.\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, the PPACA), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” to or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilars are licensed based on FDA’s findings of safety, purity, and potency for a previously FDA-licensed product called a reference product. There must be no differences in route of administration, dosage form, and strength to rely on a given reference product, and there can be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one comparative clinical study sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed, absent a waiver from the FDA. A biosimilar also may meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability such that it can be substituted for a reference product without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider. For licensure as an interchangeable biosimilar, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient, and for a product that is administered more than once to an individual, that the risk of switching in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. The first biosimilar product was approved under the BPCIA in 2015, and the first interchangeable product was approved in 2021. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. A reference biologic is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product during which no biosimilar referencing such biologic can be licensed by FDA, and no such biosimilar application relying on the reference product can be submitted for four years from the date of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product is eligible for exclusivity precluding marketing of interchangeable biosimilars referencing the same reference product for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar to be approved, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is not patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar’s application has been approved if the interchangeable applicant has been sued under the BPCIA and any related patent litigation is ongoing within the 42-month period.\nData Exclusivity and Market Exclusivity in the EU\nThe EU provides opportunities for market and data exclusivity for all products containing a New Active Substance, or NAS (such as a chemical, biological or radiopharmaceutical substance not previously authorized as a medicinal product in the EU), which have been granted an MA. These products receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial MA of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.\nOrphan Drug Designation\nOrphan drug designation is granted by the FDA and the EC to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which in the U.S. is defined as having a prevalence of less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or as a condition that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the costs of development of said drug will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the EU, orphan drug designation is available if a sponsor can establish: that the medicine is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU, which is equivalent to around 250,000 people or fewer, or (2) a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives derived from the orphan status, it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicinal product in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these criteria, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application and, in the EU, it must be maintained until the time of the granting of the MA. Orphan designation is indeed lost in the EU if it is established that the product no longer meets the orphan criteria at the time a MA is granted for such product.\nOrphan drug designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives approval for the indication for which it has designation, the relevant regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same condition, except in limited circumstances, for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU (extendable to twelve years for medicines that have complied with an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006) and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process are available in the EU, including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. Among the benefits of orphan drug designation in the U.S. are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA/BLA application user fee. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights obtained upon approval of an orphan-designated drug may be lost under certain conditions, such as if the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. A competitor may also demonstrate that its proposed product is “clinically superior” to a product with orphan drug exclusivity, allowing for approval and market entry of the same drug for the same condition during the first product’s orphan drug exclusivity period. In the EU, a MA may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the regulatory exclusivity period with the consent of the MA holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the MA holder of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. A MA may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the second applicant can establish that its medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the criteria for its designation as an orphan medicine are no longer satisfied, for example if the original orphan medicinal product has become sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.\nHealthcare Reform\nThe U.S. federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry, including legislation that seeks to directly or indirectly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors “Government healthcare reform could increase our costs and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.”\nIn addition, in the EU, EMA, the EC and other comparable regulatory authorities continue to propose and pass legislation and issue additional guidelines that may affect the applicable legislative framework. In particular, the EU pharmaceutical legislation is currently the subject of a review process, in the context of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe initiative, launched by the EC in November 2020. The EC’s proposal for a revision of several legislative instruments related to medicinal products (potentially reducing the duration of regulatory exclusivity, revising the eligibility for expedited pathways, etc.) was published on April 26, 2023. The proposed revisions remain to be agreed and adopted by the European Parliament and European Council. The proposals may be substantially revised before adoption. The revisions may, however, have a significant impact on our activities in the long term.\nOther Regulatory Requirements\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback, false claims, patient data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. The PPACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback and certain other criminal healthcare fraud statutes such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and \nprescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. The PPACA amended the statute so that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn are used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, certain types of advanced practice nurses and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. \nThe majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states while other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Other states require submission or disclosure of certain pricing information and/or notifications and information about price increases that exceed a specified threshold. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, states including California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include significant penalties, including administrative and criminal sanctions, civil monetary penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, exclusion of a company from federal healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, criminal fines, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, curtailment of operations and imprisonment.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any non-U.S. government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Similar laws exist in other countries, such as the U.K., that restrict improper payments to public and private parties. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. In the EU, for example, harmonized rules prohibit gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind to Health Care Professionals (HCPs) unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. Similarly, strict rules apply to hospitality at sales promotion events. Based on these rules, a body of industry guidelines and sometimes national laws in force in individual EU Member States has been introduced to fight improper payments or other transfers of value to HCPs, and in general inducements that may have a broadly promotional character. Historically, pharmaceutical companies have been the target of FCPA and other anti-corruption and similar investigations, as well as of wide media attention, sometimes resulting in significant penalties, image and other costs for such companies.\nPricing and Reimbursement\nBecause the course of treatment for patients using our products is expensive, sales of our products depend, in significant part, on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement offered by third-party payers, including government payers and private insurance plans. Governments may regulate access to, prices of or reimbursement levels for our products to control costs or to affect levels of use of our products, and private insurers may be influenced by government reimbursement methodologies.\nThird-party payers carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs, examine their medical necessity, and review their cost effectiveness. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third-party payer, the insurance plan and other factors. One payer’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage for the product. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payer will pay for the product. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not necessarily mean that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain high enough price levels to realize sufficient revenues from our investment in product development. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nOutside of the U.S. our products are paid for by a variety of payers, with governments being the primary source of payment. Reimbursement in the EU and many other territories must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until pricing and/or reimbursement is approved. In many countries the government closely regulates drug pricing and reimbursement and often has a significant discretion in determining whether a product will be reimbursed at all and, if it is, how much will be paid. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of our products. Payers in many countries use a variety of cost-containment measures that can include referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set their own price, mandatory price cuts and rebates. This international patchwork of price regulation has led to different prices across countries and some cross-border trade in our products from markets with lower prices. Even after a price is negotiated, countries frequently request or require adjustments to the price and other concessions over time.\nGovernment Pricing and Reimbursement Programs for Marketed Drugs in the U.S.\nMedicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare\nFederal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. CMS administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the drug manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under abbreviated new drug applications (referred to as ANDAs), the minimum rebate amount is 13% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) for the quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. For innovator products (i.e., drugs that are marketed under NDAs or BLAs), the minimum rebate amount is generally the greater of 23.1% of the AMP for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator and non-innovator products may also be subject to an additional inflation rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s AMP for a given quarter exceeds the AMP for a previous baseline quarter. For many years, the total rebate amount for a unit of a drug was capped at 100% of the AMP; however, effective January 1, 2024, this cap was eliminated, which means that a manufacturer could pay a rebate amount on a unit of the drug that is greater than the average price the manufacturer receives for the drug.\nThe terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information. CMS may also impose penalties against a manufacturer that is notified by CMS about a “misclassification”, defined as an incorrectly reported drug attribute (for example, an erroneous classification of non-innovator rather than innovator), and fails to correct the error within 30 days. The penalties include monetary penalties and/or suspension of the drug from Medicaid coverage until the error is corrected. CMS may also suspend a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate agreement if a manufacturer fails to submit the required pricing reports or fails to correct a misclassification within 90 calendar days after receiving notice from CMS.\nA manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s drugs and biological products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain safety net healthcare providers no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. \nManufacturers are required to report pricing information to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) on a quarterly basis. HRSA has also issued regulations relating to the calculation of the ceiling price as well as imposition of civil monetary penalties for each instance of knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity. There is ongoing litigation that may restrict the number of third-party contract pharmacies that can dispense drugs that manufacturers sell to 340B covered entities and who qualifies as patients of these 340B covered entities. The outcome of this litigation may change the scope of the 340B program in coming years. \nFederal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of drugs that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and hospital outpatient departments for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), manufacturers are also required to provide quarterly rebates for certain single-source drugs and biologics (including biosimilars) covered under Medicare Part B with prices that increase faster than the rate of inflation, and in November 2024, CMS finalized regulations pertaining to the Medicare Part B inflation rebates. This requirement started on January 1, 2023, for drugs approved on or before December 1, 2020, and begins six quarters after a drug is first marketed for all other drugs. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.\nMedicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for individuals at least 65 years of age and certain people with disabilities. Enrollees in Part D plans, after they meet a deductible, pay a co-insurance of 25% until they reach the out-of-pocket limit, after which they have no co-insurance. The out-of-pocket limit is $2,000 in 2025 and is to be adjusted for inflation thereafter. Each manufacturer of drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs, in order for these drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D, is required to enter into a Medicare Part D manufacturer discount agreement with HHS and provide a discount on those drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D enrollees. The discount is 10% of Part D enrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs above the deductible and below the out-of-pocket limit, and 20% once the out-of-pocket limit has been reached. The IRA also requires manufacturers to provide annual Medicare Part D rebates for single-source drugs and biological products with prices that increase faster than the rate of inflation, and in November 2024, CMS finalized regulations pertaining to Medicare Part D inflation rebates.\nThe IRA also allows the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to directly negotiate the selling price of a statutorily specified number of drugs and biologics each year that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D. The negotiated price may not exceed a statutory ceiling price. Only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can qualify for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. For 2026, the first year in which negotiated prices become effective, CMS selected 10 high-cost Medicare Part D products in 2023, negotiations began in 2024, and the negotiated maximum fair price for each product has been announced. CMS has selected 15 additional Medicare Part D drugs for negotiated maximum fair pricing in 2027. For 2028, an additional 15 drugs, which may be covered under either Medicare Part B or Part D, will be selected, and for 2029 and subsequent years, 20 Part B or Part D drugs will be selected. A drug or biological product that has an orphan drug designation for only one rare disease or condition will be excluded from the IRA's price negotiations requirements, but loses that exclusion if it has designations for more than one rare disease or condition, or if is approved for an indication that is not within that single designated rare disease or condition, unless such additional designation or such disqualifying approvals are withdrawn by the time CMS evaluates the drug for selection for negotiation.\nU.S. Federal Contracting and Pricing Requirements\nManufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), which is administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for the manufacturer’s covered drugs to be eligible for purchase by these agencies and also in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement of the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (FCP), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP) for the prior government fiscal year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions.\nThe accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for significant civil monetary penalties per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions, and civil penalties under the Federal False Claims Act if such failures are knowing.\nDisclosure of Clinical Trial Information\nSponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial are then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. In certain circumstances, disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. In the EU there is an increasing trend requiring public disclosure of development data, in particular clinical trial data. These data were traditionally regarded as Confidential Commercial Information (CCI); however, under policies adopted in the EU, clinical study data submitted to the EMA in MAAs, including preclinical data, and patient level data, may be subject to public disclosure. This is confirmed in the CTR, the new EU legislation on clinical trials, according to which clinical trial applications and all the related documentation are uploaded and stored in the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) which is managed by the EMA. Confirming the transparency principle, the CTR provides that the information stored in such system is publicly accessible unless confidentiality is justified on the basis of a limited set of exceptions. These exceptions, which are to be interpreted narrowly in the EU, include the protection of CCI, in particular through taking into account the status of the MA for the applicable product; however, CCI is overridden in those cases where the authorities conclude that there is an overriding public interest in disclosure. Case law of the Court of Justice of the EU has also confirmed the absence of a general presumption of confidentiality over documents containing clinical and preclinical data provided to the EMA in support of a MAA.\nPediatric Indications\nIn the U.S., under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 (PREA), most NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indication(s) in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by statute or regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted; the orphan drug exemption, however, does not apply where the product is a molecularly-targeted oncology drug. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides sponsors of NDAs with an additional six-month period of market exclusivity for all unexpired patent or non-patent exclusivity on all forms of the drug containing the active moiety if the sponsor submits results of pediatric studies specifically requested by the FDA under BPCA within required timeframes. The BPCA provides sponsors of BLAs an additional six-month extension for all unexpired non-patent market exclusivity on all forms of the biological containing the active moiety pursuant to the BPCA if the conditions under the BPCA are met.\nIn the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree to a PIP with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a deferral or waiver is granted by the EMA on request by the applicant (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP requirement also applies when a MA holder intends to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicinal product that has already been authorized. The MAA for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Once all the studies and measures agreed have been conducted in accordance with the PIP, products are eligible for a six -month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two -year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is granted subject to specific conditions. These conditions include that the applicant demonstrates having complied with all the measures contained in the PIP, that the summary of product characteristics, and if appropriate the package leaflet, reflects the results of studies conducted in compliance with such PIP, and that the product is authorized in all Member States. The rewards for conducting studies in the pediatric population can be granted irrespective of the fact that the information generated in compliance with the agreed PIP fails to lead to the authorization of a pediatric indication.\nPrivacy and Security Legislation\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal or sensitive data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, and industry standards related to data privacy, security, and protection. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (EU GDPR), the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (UK) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (UK GDPR).\nThe legislative and regulatory environments regarding privacy and data protection are continually evolving and developing, in response to increasing global attention. In the U.S., for example, we are subject to the CCPA along with the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA). The CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collecting, using, and disclosing personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for \ncivil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, the CPRA, effective January 1, 2023, expanded the CCPA. The CPRA, among other things, gives California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expands the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law.\nOther jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. Several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. Additionally, we are, or may become, subject to various U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws which require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.\nWe are also subject to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation GDPR, which requires that personal data is only collected for specified, explicit and legal purposes as set out in the GDPR or local laws, and the data may then only be processed in a manner consistent with those purposes. The personal data collected and processed must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is collected and processed, it must be held securely, not transferred outside of the EEA (unless certain steps are taken to ensure an adequate level of protection), and must not be retained for longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data to implement adequate technical measures in order to ensure the most appropriate level of security which may vary depending on different factors such as the categories of processed personal data, the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In addition, the GDPR requires companies processing personal data to take certain organizational steps to ensure that they have adequate records, policies, security, training and governance frameworks in place to ensure the protection of data subject rights, including as required to respond to complaints and requests from data subjects. For example, the GDPR requires us to make more detailed disclosures to data subjects, requires disclosure of the legal basis on which we can process personal data, provides for conditions under which a valid consent for processing can be obtained, requires the appointment of a data protection officer where sensitive personal data (i.e., health data) is processed on a large scale, imposes mandatory data breach notification throughout the EEA and imposes additional obligations when contracting with service providers or partners. In addition, to the extent a company processes, controls or otherwise uses “special category” of personal data (including patients’ health or medical information, genetic information and biometric information), more stringent rules apply, further limiting the circumstances and the manner in which a company is legally permitted to process that data.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 3,040 employees worldwide, of whom 1,472 were in operations, 635 were in research and development, 458 were in sales and marketing and 475 were in administration. Of the 3,040 employees as of December 31, 2024, 1,917 employees were in the U.S. and Canada, and 1,123 employees were outside of North America, including 920 in Europe and the Middle East, 131 in Latin America and 72 in Asia Pacific. We also leverage temporary workers to fill short-term positions for our business and manufacturing needs. A significant portion of our employee base in the U.S. and Ireland works onsite supporting manufacturing and laboratory operations. \nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nAt BioMarin, prejudice, racism and intolerance are unacceptable. We are committed to removing barriers to employment and embedding fairness and opportunity across all aspects of our organization, including hiring, promotion and development practices. At the direction of BioMarin's senior leadership team, our human resources department has implemented policies, processes, and programs to improve inclusion at all levels of the organization. In addition, the Corporate Governance and Nominating and Compensation Committees of our Board of Directors regularly receive reports on our initiatives and offer valuable insights and recommendations to management in addition to providing appropriate oversight. As part of our ongoing governance review, we are evaluating the potential impact of the presidential executive orders issued in early 2025 regarding diversity, equity and inclusion on our policies, processes and programs as well as our business.\nAs of December 31, 2024, racial and ethnic minorities represented 51% of our employees in the U.S. Globally, 50% of our workforce were women and 50% of our positions at director-level and above were held by women. We are committed to continuing our ongoing efforts to eliminate barriers to employment, and support diversity by expanding our talent search for all positions, including leadership. \nEquality, inclusiveness and belonging are central to BioMarin's culture, and we work to make our company a place where every employee feels heard, respected and valued. We believe encouraging and incorporating ideas from employees with different backgrounds helps us better serve our patients, achieve our business goals and objectives and provide employees with a fulfilling work experience. We also continue to support our employee resource groups that build community for all employees, including those from underrepresented populations. Our Foundational and Advanced Diversity, Equity and Inclusion training empowers every employee to champion inclusion with opportunities for deeper learning and growth. Furthermore, through mentorship and leadership development programs, we cultivate our talent and create pathways for employees to thrive.\nCompensation, Benefits and Well-being\nWe offer competitive compensation and benefits in order to attract and retain excellent employees and support their overall well-being. Our total rewards compensation package includes market-competitive salary, the potential to earn bonuses or sales commissions, equity, healthcare benefits, retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, wellness programs such as subsidized access to fitness centers and onsite fitness facilities, an Employee Assistance Program and other mental health services. \nWe believe employees should be paid for the value of their work, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or other protected characteristics. To this end, we benchmark and tie compensation to market data as well as to an employee’s experience, function, and performance. We regularly review our workforce compensation practices and strive for equity. Specifically, we partner with independent, third-party experts to conduct a regular and detailed pay equity assessment to determine whether gender and race/ethnicity have a significant impact on pay levels across the organization. This pay equity analysis is conducted on an employee’s total compensation, including base pay, bonus and equity. If we identify any pay gap across the organization, we typically make adjustments to mitigate such gaps. Our managers also receive training in how to recognize and prevent discrimination in hiring, performance management and compensation decisions. \nProfessional Growth and Development\nWe help our employees develop the skills and capabilities to support BioMarin’s growth and innovation. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide them with a wide range of development opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual and self-directed learning, mentoring, mobile coaching and external development. We offer our employees career-specific training and resources and support development opportunities through company sponsored programs in addition to our tuition reimbursement program. We also provide our high-potential employees with a variety of leadership coaching and management programs.\nPatient and Community Connections\nWe are striving to support our local communities around the world by developing programs that inspire and enrich both our patient populations and the areas where we live and work. We actively engage with underrepresented populations through a variety of outreach and programs. We collaborate with Biotech Partners, a non-profit organization in the San Francisco Bay Area focused on helping students who are underrepresented in the biotechnology field to gain experience through classroom instruction and paid internships. In addition, we award annual scholarships to students living with rare disease through our Rare Scholars program.\nOther Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in October 1996.

      "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. We operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other risks and uncertainties, including those that we do not currently consider material, may impair our business. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the value of our securities to decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nOur success depends on our ability to manage our growth and execute our corporate strategy.\nIn 2024, we announced our new corporate strategy for focused on innovation, growth, and value commitment, which includes, among other things, the acceleration or discontinuation of certain programs, the expansion of our pipeline, update to our commercial organizational model, and cost transformation. If we are unable to successfully execute our strategy, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAs part of the strategy, we have announced that we are advancing VOXZOGO for the treatment of conditions beyond achondroplasia, including hypochondroplasia, idiopathic short stature, Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, and SHOX deficiency. VOXZOGO addresses larger patient populations than most of our other products, and product candidates that we are currently developing or may license or acquire in the future may be intended for similarly larger patient populations than we have historically targeted. In order to continue development of such product candidates and marketing of products with larger markets, we will need to continue expanding our operations. To manage expansion effectively, we need to continue to develop and improve our research and development capabilities, manufacturing and quality capacities, sales and marketing capabilities, financial and administrative systems and standard processes for global operations. For example, strong demand for VOXZOGO in certain markets outpaced our projections in the past, and we have previously faced challenges meeting demand despite sufficient materials. While supply constraints have eased and we expect to have the ability to meet estimated demand and support ongoing clinical programs, we may face challenges meeting demand in the future. Our staff, financial resources, systems, procedures or controls may be inadequate to support our operations and may increase our exposure to regulatory, competitive, and corruption risks and our management may be unable to manage successfully current or future market opportunities or our relationships with customers and other third parties.\nIn addition, there is no guarantee that our corporate strategy will generate its expected benefits and the costs associated with implementing such strategy may be greater than anticipated. The execution of such strategy may also adversely affect our internal programs and initiatives as well as our ability to recruit and retain skilled and motivated personnel. If we are unable to execute on our corporate strategy or realize its expected benefits, then our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. \nIf we fail to develop new products and product candidates or compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint ventures, licenses or other collaboration opportunities, our ability to continue to expand our product pipeline and our growth and development would be impaired.\nOur future growth and development depend in part on our ability to successfully develop new products from our development activities. The development of biopharmaceutical products is very expensive and time intensive and involves a great degree of risk. The outcomes of research and development programs are inherently uncertain and may not result in the commercialization of any products.\nOur competitors compete with us to attract organizations for acquisitions, joint ventures, licensing arrangements or other collaborations. To date, several of our former and current product programs have been acquired through acquisitions and several of our former and current product programs have been developed through licensing or collaborative arrangements, such as ALDURAZYME, KUVAN and NAGLAZYME. These collaborations include licensing proprietary technology from, and other relationships with, academic research institutions. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to identify additional opportunities and to successfully enter into partnering or acquisition agreements for those opportunities. If our competitors successfully enter into partnering arrangements or license agreements with academic research institutions, we will then be precluded from pursuing those specific opportunities. Because each of these opportunities is unique, we may not be able to find a substitute. Several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have already established themselves in the field of genetic diseases. These companies have already begun many drug development programs, some of which target diseases that we are also targeting or may target in the future, and have already entered into partnering and licensing arrangements with academic research institutions, reducing the pool of available opportunities.\nUniversities and public and private research institutions also compete with us. While these organizations primarily have educational or basic research objectives, they may develop proprietary technology and acquire patents that we may need for the development of our product candidates. We will attempt to license this proprietary technology, if available. These licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions, joint venture \nand other collaboration opportunities, we may be limited in our ability to develop new products and to continue to expand our product pipeline.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce or fail to achieve such goals, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed or never occur and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings. From time to time, we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions. The actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates or the milestones may never be achieved, in many cases for reasons beyond our control. If we do not meet development milestones as publicly announced, the commercialization of our products may be delayed or never occur and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.\nIf we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenues could be adversely affected.\nOur competitors may develop, manufacture and market products that are more effective or less expensive than ours. They may also obtain regulatory approvals for their products faster than we can obtain them (including those products with orphan drug designation, which may prevent us from marketing our product entirely for seven years, along with other regulatory exclusivities that could block approval) or commercialize their products before we do. With respect to VOXZOGO, other companies are developing, and may in the future develop, products for treatment for achondroplasia that, if approved, could potentially compete with VOXZOGO even during the period of orphan drug exclusivity, for example by using an alternative formulation or a different delivery technology. As we commercialize our products, we have faced and may continue to face intense competition from other pharmaceutical companies, some of which may have more extensive resources and/or established relationships in the communities we seek to treat. If we do not compete successfully, our revenues would be adversely affected, and we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product.\nWe also face competition from generic versions of our products. For example, generic versions of KUVAN are available in several countries around the world, including in the U.S. and the European Union (EU), which has adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our revenues from KUVAN. Competitors launching generic versions of our products independently establish the price of such products and determine the types of discounts or rebates they will offer parties that purchase or pay for the product. Generic competition often results in decreases in the net prices at which branded products can be sold. After any introduction of a generic product, a significant percentage of the prescriptions written for our branded products will likely be filled with the generic product. Certain U.S. state laws allow for, and in some instances in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician mandate, the dispensing of generic products rather than branded products when a generic version is available. We expect that the approval and launch of generic versions of our products and the approval and launch of branded products that compete with our products will continue to have a negative impact and could have a material adverse effect on our sales of our products and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. \nIf we fail to obtain and maintain an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for our products by third-party payers, the sales of our products would be adversely affected or there may be no commercially viable markets for our products.\nThe course of treatment for patients using our products is expensive. We expect that most families of patients will not be capable of paying for our treatments themselves. For most of our products, we expect patients to need treatment for extended periods, and for some products throughout the lifetimes of the patients. There will be no commercially viable market for our products without coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Additionally, even if there is a commercially viable market, if the level of reimbursement is below our expectations, our revenues and gross margin will be adversely affected.\nThird-party payers, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs. Reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third-party payer, the insurance plan and other factors. Obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis.\nGovernment authorities and other third-party payers are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, such as by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payers are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices as a condition of coverage, \nare using restrictive formularies and preferred drug lists to leverage greater discounts in competitive classes, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers in the U.S. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nWe cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize or will continue to be available for any product that we have commercialized and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future based on new legislation, the availability of alternative therapies and their pricing, coverage and reimbursement decisions by third-party payers, or other factors. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval or continue to market any product that has already been commercialized.\nReimbursement in the EU and many other territories must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until pricing and/or reimbursement is approved. The timing to complete the negotiation process in each country is highly uncertain, and in some countries, we expect that it will exceed 12 months. Even after a price is negotiated, countries frequently request or require reductions to the price and other concessions over time.\nFor our future products, we will not know what the reimbursement rates will be until we are ready to market the product and we actually negotiate the rates. If we are unable to obtain sufficiently high reimbursement rates for our products, they may not be commercially viable or our future revenues and gross margin may be adversely affected.\nBecause the target patient populations for our products are relatively small, we must achieve significant market share and maintain high per-patient prices for our products to achieve and maintain profitability.\nAll of our products target diseases with relatively small patient populations. As a result, our per-patient prices must be relatively high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs and achieve and maintain profitability. For BRINEURA, NAGLAZYME and VIMIZIM in particular, we must market worldwide to achieve significant market penetration of the product. In addition, because the number of potential patients in each disease population is small, it is not only important to find patients who begin therapy to achieve significant market penetration of the product, but we also need to be able to maintain these patients on therapy for an extended period of time. Due to the expected costs of treatment for our products, we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient market share at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and manufacturing expenses.\nChanges in methods of treatment of disease or failure of our products to gain acceptance by patients or the medical community could negatively impact demand for our products and adversely affect revenues.\nEven if our product candidates are approved, if doctors were to elect a course of treatment which does not include our products, this decision would reduce demand for our products and adversely affect revenues. For example, if gene therapy becomes widely used as a treatment of genetic diseases, the use of enzyme replacement therapy, such as ALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME, and VIMIZIM in MPS diseases, could be greatly reduced. Changes in treatment method can be caused by the introduction of other companies’ products or the development of new technologies or surgical procedures which may not directly compete with ours, but which have the effect of changing how doctors decide to treat a disease.\nWe also face uncertainty as to whether gene therapy will gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. The commercial success of ROCTAVIAN will depend, in part, on the acceptance of physicians, patients and third-party payers of gene therapy products in general, and our product in particular, as medically necessary, cost-effective and safe. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians prescribing our product in lieu of existing treatments they are already familiar with and for which greater clinical data may be available. Although administration of a gene therapy product like ROCTAVIAN is intended to correct an inborn genetic defect for at least several years, if the therapeutic effect of ROCTAVIAN decreases significantly or ceases entirely, it is uncertain whether redosing would be possible or effective. Adverse effects would not be able to be reversed or relieved by stopping dosing, and we may have to develop additional clinical safety procedures. Additionally, because the new gene copies are designed to reside permanently in a patient, there is a risk that they will disrupt other normal biological molecules and processes, including other healthy genes, and we may not learn the nature and magnitude of these side effects until long after clinical trials have been completed. Negative public opinion or more restrictive government regulations could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition and may delay or impair the successful commercialization of, and demand for, ROCTAVIAN. If we do not accurately forecast demand and manufacture ROCTAVIAN in amounts that exceed actual demand, then we may build excess inventory that may need to be written off, or incur an impairment charge with respect to the facility where ROCTAVIAN is manufactured, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have in the past entered and may in the future enter into licensing arrangements, and we may not realize the benefits of such licensing arrangements. \nWe have in the past entered and may in the future enter into licensing arrangements with third parties. It is possible that we may not achieve financial or strategic benefits that justify a specific license, or we may otherwise not realize the benefits of such licensing arrangement. Further, licensing arrangements impose various diligence, milestone and royalty payment and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under any current or future licenses, our licensors may have the right to terminate these license agreements, which could harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, counterparties to our license agreements have in the past alleged and may in the future allege that we have breached a license agreement, which can result in litigation or other disputes that can divert management’s attention away from our business and require us to expend resources, as well as potentially having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. Any such situation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nActivist investor actions threatened or commenced against us have and could in the future cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to activities initiated by activist investors. For example, in December 2023, we entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Elliott Investment Management L.P., Elliott Associates, L.P. and Elliott International, L.P., which expired in December 2024 pursuant to the terms of the agreement. We may not be successful in engaging constructively with one or more investors in the future despite our efforts to maintain constructive and ongoing communications with all investors. Resulting actions taken by activist investors from time to time have and could in the future conflict with our strategic direction, divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management, and employees, be costly and time-consuming, and disrupt the momentum in our business and operations, as well as our ability to execute our strategic plan. These types of actions may also create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy, which may be exploited by our competitors and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and may impact our relationships with investors, vendors, customers and other third parties. These types of actions could also impact the market price and the volatility of our common stock. In addition, we may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of activist investor actions, which would serve as a further distraction to our Board of Directors, senior management and employees and could require us to incur significant additional costs.\nRegulatory Risks\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval to commercially market and sell our product candidates, or if approval of our product candidates is delayed, we will be unable to generate revenues from the sale of these product candidates, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will increase.\nWe must obtain regulatory approval to market and sell our product candidates. For example, in the U.S., we must obtain approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for each product candidate that we intend to commercialize, and in the EU, we must obtain approval from the European Commission (EC), based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The FDA and EC approval processes are typically lengthy and expensive, and approval is never certain. To obtain regulatory approval, we must first show that our product candidates are safe and effective for target indications through preclinical studies and clinical trials. Preclinical studies and clinical development are long, expensive and uncertain processes. Completion of clinical trials may take several years, and failure may occur at any stage of development. The length of time required varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. Interim results of a preclinical test or clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results, and acceptable results in early clinical trials may not be repeated in later clinical trials. Accordingly, there are no assurances that we will obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that approval of one of our product candidates by one regulatory authority will mean that other authorities will also approve the same product candidate. Similarly, in the EU, a positive CHMP opinion for approval of a product candidate does not guarantee that the EC will approve the product candidate. Moreover, regulatory authorities may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested. In addition, regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have had fewer interactions with regulatory authorities outside the U.S. and the EU as compared to our interactions with the FDA, the EC and the EMA. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA or EC approval. Moreover, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA or EC does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more non-U.S. regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other non-U.S. countries or by the FDA or EC. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. The non-U.S. regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA or EC approval. We may not obtain non-U.S. \nregulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and even if we file, we may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our product candidates in any market.\nWe also rely on independent third-party Contract Research Organizations (CROs) to file some of our non-U.S. marketing applications, and while we keep a close oversight on the activities we delegate to CROs, important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct control. If we fail to adequately manage our CROs, if the CRO elects to prioritize work on our projects below other projects or if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, the filing of our applications may be delayed.\nAlthough the FDA, the EC and the EMA have programs to facilitate expedited development and accelerated approval processes, the timelines agreed under legislative goals or mandated by regulations are subject to the possibility of substantial delays. Accordingly, even if any of our applications receives a designation to facilitate expedited development and accelerated approval processes, these designations may not result in faster review or approval for our product candidates compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional procedures and, in any event, do not assure ultimate approval of our product candidates by regulatory authorities. In addition, the FDA, the EC, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities have substantial discretion over the approval process for pharmaceutical products. These regulatory authorities may not agree that we have demonstrated the requisite level of product safety and efficacy to warrant approval and may require, and in the past have required, additional data. If we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to market and sell those product candidates, which would have a negative effect on our business and financial condition.\nRegulatory authorities and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. For example, on April 26, 2023, the EC adopted a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation to revise the existing pharmaceutical legislation. While discussions are still ongoing as part of the legislative process, this proposal may result in a decrease in data and market exclusivity for our product candidates in the EU.\nIn addition, some of our product candidates are intended to be used in combination with a medical device, such as an injector or other delivery system. Some of these products intended to be used with a medical device may be regulated as “combination products” in the U.S. and the EU, which are generally defined as products consisting of components from two or more regulatory categories (e.g., drug/device, device/biologic, drug/biologic). In the U.S., each component of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of component, whether a new drug, biologic or device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by the FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product. The determination whether a product is a combination product or two separately regulated products is made by the FDA on a case-by-case basis. In the EU, medical devices and medicinal products are regulated separately, through different legislative instruments. The related applicable requirements will vary depending on the type of drug-device combination product. If, for example, a device intended to administer a medicinal product is sold together with such medicinal product in such a way that they form a single integral product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, that single integral product is regulated as a medicinal product. In addition, the relevant general safety and performance requirements (GSPRs) established for medical devices by EU medical devices legislation apply to the device component of such combination products. In addition, some of our products require use with an in vitro companion diagnostic. Our product candidates may also require use with an in vitro companion diagnostic if the FDA determines that the companion diagnostic is essential for safe and effective use of the product candidate. The FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. Most companion diagnostics require approval of a premarket approval application. In the EU, companion diagnostics are deemed to be in vitro diagnostic medical devices and must conform with the applicable GSPRs. To demonstrate compliance with the GSPRs, companion diagnostics must undergo a conformity assessment by a Notified Body. If the related medicinal product has been, or is in the process of being, authorized through the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicinal products, the Notified Body will, before it can issue a CE Certificate of Conformity, be required to seek a scientific opinion from the EMA on the suitability of the companion diagnostic for use in relation to the medicinal product concerned. For medicinal products that have been or are in the process of authorization through any other route provided in EU legislation, the Notified Body must seek the opinion of the national competent authority of an EU Member State. Our product candidates intended for use with separately regulated devices, such as companion diagnostics, or expanded indications that we may seek for our products used with such devices, may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving approval if the devices do not gain and/or maintain their own regulatory approvals, clearances, or certifications. Where approval of the drug or biologic product and device is sought under a single application, such as a drug with an injector or delivery system, the increased complexity of the review process may delay approval. The FDA and EU review processes and related criteria are complex, which could also lead to delays in the approval process. In addition, because these devices are provided by unaffiliated third-party companies, we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to obtain regulatory approval and to maintain their own regulatory compliance. Failure of third-party companies to assist in the approval process or to maintain their own regulatory compliance could delay or prevent approval of our product candidates, or limit our ability to sell a product once it is approved.\nFrom time to time during the development and regulatory approval process for our products and product candidates, we engage in discussions with the FDA, the EC, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities regarding our development programs, including discussions about the regulatory requirements for approval. As part of these discussions, we sometimes seek advice in the design of our clinical programs from various regulatory authorities globally, but we do not always follow such guidance. This increases the chance of adverse regulatory actions, but we try to always provide appropriate scientific evidence to support approval. Moreover, sometimes different regulatory authorities provide different or conflicting advice. While we attempt to harmonize the advice we receive from multiple regulatory authorities, it is not always practical to do so. Also, we may choose not to harmonize conflicting advice when harmonization would significantly delay clinical trial data or is otherwise inappropriate. If we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and comply with the inquiries and requests of the FDA, the EC, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities, the approval of our product candidates may be delayed and their value may be reduced.\nAny product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain approval in the future, is subject to, or will be subject to, extensive ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA, the EC, the EMA and other comparable international regulatory authorities, and if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, we may be subject to penalties, we will be unable to generate revenues from the sale of such products, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished, and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased.\nOur products have received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed and sold in the U.S., the EU, and certain other countries except ROCTAVIAN, which has received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed in the U.S. and conditional approval to be commercially marketed in the EU. Any product for which we have obtained regulatory approval, or for which we obtain regulatory approval in the future, along with the manufacturing processes and practices, post-approval clinical research, product labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, are subject to continual requirements of, and review by, the FDA, the EC, the EMA and/or other comparable international and national regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, import and export requirements and record keeping.\nAn example of the ongoing regulatory requirements our products are subject to is the PALYNZIQ Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program. In the U.S., PALYNZIQ is only available through the REMS program, which is required by the FDA to mitigate the risk of anaphylaxis while using the product. Notable requirements of our REMS program include the following:\n•prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the REMS program and completing training;\n•prescribers must prescribe auto-injectable epinephrine with PALYNZIQ;\n•pharmacies must be certified with the REMS program and must dispense PALYNZIQ only to patients who are authorized to receive it;\n•patients must enroll in the REMS program and be educated about the risk of anaphylaxis by a certified prescriber to ensure they understand the risks and benefits of treatment with PALYNZIQ; and\n•patients must have auto-injectable epinephrine available at all times while taking PALYNZIQ.\nFailure of prescribers, pharmacies or patients to enroll in our REMS program or to successfully complete and comply with its requirements may result in regulatory action from the FDA or decreased sales of PALYNZIQ. The restrictions and requirements under our REMS program, as well as potential changes to these restrictions and requirements in the future, subject us to increased risks and uncertainties, any of which could harm our business. The requirement for a REMS program can materially affect the potential market for and profitability of a drug. We cannot predict whether the FDA will request, seek to require or ultimately require modifications to, or impose additional requirements on, the PALYNZIQ REMS program, or whether the FDA will permit modifications to the PALYNZIQ REMS program that we consider warranted. Any modifications required or rejected by the FDA could make it more difficult or expensive for us to distribute PALYNZIQ in the U.S., impair the safety profile of PALYNZIQ, disrupt continuity of care for PALYNZIQ patients and/or negatively affect sales of PALYNZIQ.\nIn addition, in the EU, the marketing authorization for BRINEURA was granted under “exceptional circumstances”. As a result, the risk-benefit balance of BRINEURA is reviewed annually and the marketing authorization may be withdrawn if the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable. The conditional marketing authorization for ROCTAVIAN is, moreover, valid for one year and must be reviewed annually until all related conditions have been fulfilled to permit transfer to a full authorization. Failure to continue to show favorable risk-benefit balance for BRINEURA or satisfy the conditions related to ROCTAVIAN’s conditional marketing authorization could result in the withdrawal of the marketing approvals for these products.\nMoreover, promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs, including biologics, are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product’s approved labeling and Summary of Product Characteristics. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or the EC as reflected in the product’s approved labeling. Although the FDA and other comparable international and national regulatory \nauthorities do not regulate a physician’s choice of drug treatment made in the physician’s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. The FDA and other national competent authorities or international regulatory authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties. Thus, we are not able to promote any products we develop for indications or uses for which they are not approved. Additionally, in the EU, it is prohibited to promote prescription drugs to the general public and we are therefore limited to promote our products exclusively to healthcare professionals. Public prosecutors, industry associations, healthcare professionals and other authorities and members of the public, including competitors, closely scrutinize advertising and promotion of any product in the EU.\nMoreover, if original FDA approval for one of our product candidates is granted via the accelerated approval pathway, we will be required to conduct a post-marketing confirmatory trial to verify and describe the clinical benefit in support of full approval. An unsuccessful post-marketing study or failure to complete such a study with due diligence could result in the withdrawal of the FDA’s marketing approval for a product candidate. For example, VOXZOGO is approved in the U.S. under accelerated approval based on an improvement in annualized growth velocity. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies. To fulfill this post-marketing requirement, we intend to use our ongoing open-label extension studies compared to available natural history. In addition, the FDA and the EC often require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of products. The FDA, the EC and other comparable international regulatory authorities may condition approval of our product candidates on the completion of such post-marketing clinical studies. These post-marketing studies may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects or may present a risk to the patient.\nDiscovery after approval of previously unknown problems with any of our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n•the issuance of safety alerts, press releases or other communications containing warnings about related products; \n•modifications to promotional materials or corrective information to healthcare professionals; \n•restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned trials;\n•suspensions or restrictions on our operations, including product manufacturing processes;\n•restrictions on the marketing of a product;\n•restrictions on product distribution;\n•requirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n•untitled or warning letters or other adverse publicity;\n•withdrawal of the products from the market;\n•suspended or withdrawn regulatory approvals;\n•refusal or delays to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n•recall of products;\n•refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n•product seizure;\n•fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n•injunctions; or\n•imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nIf such regulatory actions are taken, our value and our operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, if the FDA, the EC or any other comparable international regulatory authorities withdraws its approval of a product, we will be unable to generate revenues from the sale of that product in the relevant jurisdiction, our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased. Accordingly, we continue to expend significant time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance, post-marketing studies and quality control.\nTo obtain regulatory approval to market our products, preclinical studies and costly and lengthy clinical trials are required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain. Likewise, preliminary, initial or interim data from clinical trials should be considered carefully and with caution because the final data may be materially different from the preliminary, initial or interim data, particularly as more patient data become available.\nAs part of the drug development process, we must conduct, at our own expense, preclinical studies in the laboratory, including studies in animals, and clinical trials on humans for each product candidate. The number of preclinical studies and clinical \ntrials that regulatory authorities require varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition the drug is being developed to address and regulations applicable to the particular drug. Generally, new drugs for diseases or conditions that affect larger patient populations, are less severe, or are treatable by alternative strategies must be validated through additional preclinical and clinical trials and/or clinical trials with higher enrollments. With respect to our early-stage product candidates, we may need to perform multiple preclinical studies using various doses and formulations before we can begin clinical trials, which could result in delays to our development timeline. Furthermore, even if we obtain favorable results in preclinical studies, the results in humans may be significantly different. After we have conducted preclinical studies, we must demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and efficacious for the intended indication and for use in the targeted human patients in order to receive regulatory approval for commercial sale. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and favorable data from interim analyses do not ensure the final results of a trial will be favorable. From time to time, we have published and may in the future publish or report preliminary, initial or interim data from our clinical trials. Preliminary, initial or interim data from our clinical trials may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and/or more patient data become available. In this regard, such data may show initial evidence of clinical benefit, but as patients continue to be followed and more patient data become available, there is a risk that any therapeutic effects will not be durable in patients and/or will decrease over time or cease entirely. Preliminary, initial or interim data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from such preliminary, initial or interim data. As a result, preliminary, initial or interim data should be considered carefully and with caution until the final data are available.\nProduct candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials, or despite having favorable data in connection with an interim analysis. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Also, as noted above, we do not always follow the advice of regulatory authorities or comply with all of their requests regarding the design of our clinical programs. In those cases, we may choose a development program that is inconsistent with the advice of regulatory authorities, which may limit the jurisdictions where we conduct clinical trials and/or adversely affect our ability to obtain approval in those jurisdictions where we do not follow the regulatory advice.\nAdverse or inconclusive clinical results could stop us from obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials include:\n•slow or insufficient patient enrollment;\n•slow recruitment of, and completion of necessary institutional approvals at, clinical sites;\n•budgetary constraints or prohibitively high clinical trial costs;\n•longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy;\n•lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate;\n•adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients, including immune reactions;\n•lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested;\n•availability of competitive therapies to treat the same indication as our product candidates;\n•regulatory requests for additional clinical trials or preclinical studies;\n•deviations in standards for Good Clinical Practice (GCP); and\n•disputes with or disruptions in our relationships with clinical trial partners, including CROs, clinical laboratories, clinical sites, and principal investigators.\nGovernment price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products, which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe expect that coverage and reimbursement may be increasingly restricted in all the markets in which we sell our products. The escalating cost of healthcare has led to increased pressure on the healthcare industry to reduce costs. In particular, drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies has been under scrutiny for many years and continues to be subject to intense political and public debate in the U.S. and abroad. Governmental and private third-party payers have proposed healthcare reforms and cost reductions. A number of federal and state proposals to control the cost of healthcare, including the cost of drug treatments, have been made in the U.S. Specifically, there have been several U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed bills and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, Congress and the executive branch have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. In some international markets, the government controls the pricing, which can affect the profitability of drugs. Current government regulations and possible future legislation regarding healthcare may affect coverage and reimbursement for medical \ntreatment by third-party payers, which may render our products not commercially viable or may adversely affect our future revenues and gross margins.\nInternational operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations, and there are many proposals for additional cost-containment measures, including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or mandatory price cuts or reduce the value of our intellectual property portfolio. As part of these cost containment measures, some countries have imposed and continue to propose revenue caps limiting the annual volume of sales of our products. Some of these caps are significantly below the actual demand in certain countries, and if the trend regarding revenue caps continues, our future revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected. For example, in the EU, governments influence the price of medicinal products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. EU Member States are free to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market, including volume-based arrangements, caps and reference pricing mechanisms. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become very intense. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication or cost-effective by third-party payers. There is also no assurance that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments. However, future price controls or other changes in pricing regulation or negative publicity related to our product pricing or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products or our sales volume, which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nGovernment healthcare reform could increase our costs and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. In the U.S., there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. In the U.S., there have been several congressional inquiries, proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and executive action designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. Several healthcare reform initiatives culminated in the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which allows, among other things, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate the selling price of a statutorily specified number of drugs and biologics each year that the CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D. Only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation. The IRA permits the Secretary of HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. HHS has and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The IRA's provisions began taking effect progressively starting in 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Thus, while it is unclear how the IRA will be implemented, it will likely have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry.\nPrior to the IRA, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the PPACA), expanded healthcare coverage within the U.S., primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the Medicaid program. Several provisions of the law have affected us and increased certain of our costs. Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Although the PPACA has generally been upheld thus far, it is unclear how continued challenges to the law may impact the PPACA and our business. In addition, other legislative changes have been adopted since the PPACA was enacted. Some of these changes have resulted in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations.\nIn addition, individual states in the U.S. have also increasingly enacted laws and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, price and price increase disclosure and reporting requirements, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. \nLikewise, in many EU Member States, legislators and other policymakers continue to propose and implement healthcare cost-containing measures in response to the increased attention being paid to healthcare costs in the EU. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our commercial products and any product candidates or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental and private third-party payers, may increase the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies or may facilitate the introduction of generic competition with respect to our products. Further, an increasing number of EU Member States and other non-U.S. countries use prices for medicinal products established in other countries as “reference prices” to help determine the price of the product in their own territory. If the price of one of our products decreases substantially in a reference price country, it could impact the price for that product in other countries. Consequently, a downward trend in prices of our products in some countries could contribute to similar downward trends elsewhere, which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Moreover, some EU Member States may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular medicinal product candidate to currently available therapies. This Health Technology Assessment (HTA) process, which is currently governed by the national laws of the individual EU Member States, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. In 2022, the EC adopted the HTA regulation, which is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in evaluating new medicinal products. The HTA regulation became applicable s January 2025 and may result in increased downward pricing pressure in the EU.\nWe anticipate that the IRA, PPACA and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future in the U.S. or abroad, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the reimbursement our customers may receive for our products. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by governmental and private third-party payers or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for some of our products, our competitors may obtain approval to sell the same drugs to treat the same conditions and our revenues will be reduced.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have developed and may in the future develop some drugs that may be eligible for FDA and EU orphan drug designation. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S. or as a condition that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the costs of development of said drug will be recovered from sales in the U.S. In the EU, pursuant to the Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 (the Orphan Regulation), as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000, orphan drug designation is available if a sponsor can establish that: (1) the medicine is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 people in the EU at the time the application is made, or, (2) that it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives derived from the orphan status, it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. In both cases, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicine will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.\nIn the U.S., the company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years. Orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug. In addition, the FDA may approve another drug during a period of orphan drug exclusivity if the second drug is found to be clinically superior to the first drug. In the EU, a ten-year period of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication (extendable to twelve years for orphan drugs that have complied with an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) pursuant to Regulation 1901/2006), during which the EC and EU Member States cannot accept another marketing authorization (MA) application or accept an application to extend existing authorizations for similar medicinal products for the same indication and no MA can be granted. MAs may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if: (i) the applicant can establish that the second medicinal product, although similar to the orphan medicinal product already authorized is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan medicinal product already authorized; (ii) the MA holder for the first orphan medicinal product grants its consent; or (iii) if the MA holder of the orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. MAs may also be granted for the same therapeutic indication in relation to products that are not similar. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the criteria for its designation as an orphan medicine are no longer satisfied, for example if the original orphan medicinal product has become sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Because the extent and scope of patent protection for some of our products is limited, orphan drug designation and resulting regulatory exclusivity is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. For eligible products, we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the Orphan Drug Act and/or the Orphan Regulation, as applicable, to maintain a competitive position. If we do not obtain orphan drug designation and related regulatory exclusivity for our products that do not have broad patent protection or if a competing product is determined to be, for example, \"clinically superior\" to any of our \nproducts that has secured orphan drug exclusivity, our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition and our revenues will be reduced.\nEven though we have obtained orphan drug designation for certain of our product candidates and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for our future product candidates, due to the uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug regulatory exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval of certain product candidates until the competitor product’s orphan drug exclusivity period expires. Moreover, with respect to certain biologics and gene therapies, there may be some uncertainty regarding how similarity between product candidates designed to treat the same rare disease or condition may affect such product candidates’ orphan drug regulatory exclusivities. For biologics and gene therapies, the FDA’s determination of whether a drug is the same drug or a different drug will be based on the principal molecular structural features of the products. For gene therapy products, the FDA has stated in guidance that it generally intends to consider certain key features such as transgenes and vectors used in gene therapy products to be principal molecular structural features. The FDA has not yet proffered additional information on orphan drug sameness for gene therapy or similar products. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition and the same drug can be approved for different conditions and potentially used off-label in the orphan indication. Even after an orphan drug is approved and granted orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer or more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nWe may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway.\nOur ALDURAZYME, BRINEURA, NAGLAZYME, PALYNZIQ, ROCTAVIAN and VIMIZIM products are regulated by the FDA as biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act). Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) and licensure by the FDA prior to being marketed in the U.S. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) created a regulatory pathway under the PHS Act for the abbreviated licensure of biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” to or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed biological product. A similar abridged MA process is available to biosimilar products in the EU. In particular, applicants for MAs of biosimilars are required to demonstrate through comprehensive comparability studies with the reference biological medicine that: a) their biological medicine is highly similar to the reference medicine, notwithstanding natural variability inherent to all biological medicines; and b) there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the reference medicine in terms of safety, quality and efficacy.\nOur products approved under BLAs in the U.S. or as a result of Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) in the EU, as well as our product candidates that may be approved in the future, could be reference products for biosimilar marketing applications. In the U.S., a follow-on biologic may be deemed interchangeable with, and automatically substitutable for, a reference product if its sponsor can demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Even though the BPCIA establishes a period of 12 years of data exclusivity for reference products, such data exclusivity only blocks licensure of biosimilars relying on the product as a reference product; it will not prevent the licensure of the same product for the same or different indications that does not seek to rely on reference product data. In the EU, a medicinal product containing a new active substance benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which biosimilar applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which biosimilar applications may be submitted and the reference product's data may be referenced but biosimilar products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. \nChanges in funding for the FDA, the EMA, other comparable regulatory authorities and other government agencies or government shutdowns could hinder the ability of such authorities and agencies to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel or otherwise prevent those authorities and agencies from performing normal functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nChanges in funding levels of regulatory authorities and government agencies can affect their ability to hire and retain key personnel and carry out their normal functions that support our business. For example, the ability of the FDA or the EMA to timely review and approve INDs or MAAs for our product candidates may be hindered by a lack of resources and qualified personnel. In addition, funding of other regulatory authorities and government agencies on which our operations rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political budget process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nGovernment shutdowns could also impact the ability of regulatory authorities and government agencies to function normally and support our operations. For example, the U.S. federal government has shut down repeatedly since 1980, including for a period of 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018. During a shutdown, certain regulatory authorities and agencies, such as the \nFDA, have had to furlough key personnel and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFinancial and Financing Risks\nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected and we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.7 billion and debt obligations of $600.0 million (undiscounted), which consisted of our 1.25% senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2027 (the 2027 Notes). The 2027 Notes, if not converted, will be required to be repaid in cash at maturity in May 2027. We will need cash not only to pay the ongoing interest due on the 2027 Notes during their term, but also to repay the principal amount of the 2027 Notes if not converted.\nWe may require additional financing to fund the repayment of the 2027 Notes, future milestone payments and our future operations, including the commercialization of our products and product candidates currently under development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and potential licenses and acquisitions. We may be unable to raise additional financing due to a variety of factors, including our financial condition, the status of our product programs, and the general condition of the financial markets. If we fail to raise any necessary additional financing we may have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs and our financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of capital for our operations for the foreseeable future. The amount of capital we will need depends on many factors, including:\n•our ability to successfully market, protect, and sell our products;\n•the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes, including quality systems, and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities the progress and success of our preclinical studies and clinical trials (including studies and the manufacture of materials);\n•the timing, number, size and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n•the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and the costs of post-marketing studies which may be required by regulatory authorities;\n•the progress of research programs carried out by us;\n•any changes made to, or new developments in, our existing collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative, licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish;\n•Sanofi’s ability to continue to successfully commercialize ALDURAZYME; and\n•whether our convertible debt is converted to common stock in the future.\nMoreover, our fixed expenses such as rent, license payments, interest expense and other contractual commitments are substantial and may increase in the future. These fixed expenses may increase because we may enter into:\n•additional licenses and collaborative agreements;\n•additional contracts for product manufacturing; and\n•additional financing facilities or arrangements.\nWe will need to raise additional funds from equity or debt securities, loans or collaborative agreements if we are unable to satisfy our liquidity requirements. The sale of additional equity and/or equity-linked securities will result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Furthermore, additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. This could result in the delay, reduction or termination of our research, which could harm our business.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital, and/or increase our borrowing costs, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $600.0 million (undiscounted) principal amount of indebtedness, all of which was outstanding under the 2027 Notes. In August 2024, we entered into an unsecured credit agreement (the 2024 Credit Agreement) with Citibank, N.A., as the administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, providing for $600.0 million in revolving loan \ncommitments (the 2024 Credit Facility). The 2024 Credit Facility matures in August 2029. As of December 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility. Our indebtedness may:\n•limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n•limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n•require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n•limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n•increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn addition, the 2024 Credit Facility contains, and any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. If we default under the 2024 Credit Agreement, the outstanding borrowings thereunder could become immediately due and payable, the 2024 Credit Facility lenders could refuse to permit additional borrowings under the facility, or it could lead to defaults under agreements governing our current or future indebtedness, including the indenture governing the 2027 Notes. If we default under the 2027 Notes, the 2027 Notes could become immediately due and payable and it could lead to defaults under the 2024 Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time.\nOur outstanding indebtedness consists of the 2027 Notes, which, if not converted, will be required to be repaid in cash at maturity in May 2027. While we could seek to obtain additional third-party financing to pay for any amounts due in cash upon maturity of the 2027 Notes, we cannot be sure that such third-party financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, we also may borrow up to $600.0 million in revolving loans under the 2024 Credit Facility, which would be required to be repaid in cash at maturity in August 2029.\nManufacturing Risks\nIf we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations, our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nPrior to commercialization of our products, regulatory authorities must approve marketing applications that identify authorized manufacturing facilities operated by us or our contract manufacturers that are in compliance with cGMP requirements. In addition, our pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to scheduled and unannounced regulatory inspections by the FDA, and other comparable EU and other national and international regulatory authorities, before and after product approval, to monitor and ensure compliance with cGMP and other regulations. Our manufacturing facilities in the U.S. are licensed for the manufacture of PALYNZIQ, ROCTAVIAN, ALDURAZYME, BRINEURA, NAGLAZYME, VIMIZIM, and VOXZOGO. Our manufacturing facility in Shanbally, Cork, Ireland is licensed for the manufacture of VIMIZIM and BRINEURA and packaging operations for VOXZOGO and PALYNZIQ. In addition, our third-party manufacturers’ facilities involved with the manufacture of our products have also been inspected and approved by various regulatory authorities. Although we are not involved in the day-to-day operations of our contract manufacturers, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMP regulations.\nDue to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture our products and product candidates, we may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal, national or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner. For the same reason, any potential third-party manufacturer of our products or our product candidates may be unable to comply with cGMP regulations in a cost-effective manner and may be unable to initially or continue to pass a federal, national or international regulatory inspection.\nIf we, or third-party manufacturers with whom we contract, are unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, we may be subject to delay of approval of our product candidates, warning or untitled letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial results and financial condition. \nIf we are unable to successfully develop and maintain manufacturing processes for our product candidates to produce sufficient quantities at acceptable costs, we may be unable to support a clinical trial or be forced to terminate a \nprogram, or if we are unable to produce sufficient quantities of our products at acceptable costs, we may be unable to meet commercial demand, lose potential revenue, have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program.\nDue to the complexity of manufacturing our product candidates and products, we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities. Our inability to produce enough of our product candidate at acceptable costs may result in the delay or termination of development programs. With respect to our commercial portfolio, we may not be able to manufacture our products successfully with a commercially viable process or at a scale large enough to support their respective commercial markets or at acceptable margins. For example, strong demand for VOXZOGO in certain markets outpaced our projections in the past, and we have previously faced challenges meeting demand despite sufficient materials. While supply constraints have eased and we expect to have the ability to meet estimated demand and support ongoing clinical programs, we may face challenges meeting demand in the future, requiring us to postpone planned entry into additional markets until VOXZOGO inventory levels increase or delay certain VOXZOGO development activities. As a result of such inventory constraints, we have lost, and may in the future lose, potential VOXZOGO revenues that may never be recouped and our VOXZOGO development program could be adversely impacted.\nThe development of commercially viable manufacturing processes typically is very difficult to achieve and is often very expensive and may require extended periods of time. Changes in manufacturing processes (including manufacturing cell lines), equipment or facilities (including moving manufacturing from one of our facilities to another one of our facilities or a third-party facility, or from a third-party facility to one of our facilities) may require us to complete clinical trials to receive regulatory approval of any manufacturing modifications.\nAlso, we may be required to demonstrate product comparability between a biological product made after a manufacturing change and the product made before implementation of the change through additional types of analytical and functional testing or may have to complete additional nonclinical or clinical studies. If we contract for manufacturing services with an unproven process, our contractor is subject to the same uncertainties, high standards and regulatory controls, and may therefore experience difficulty if further process development is necessary.\nEven a developed manufacturing process can encounter difficulties. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including human error, mechanical breakdowns, problems with raw materials and cell banks, malfunctions of internal information technology systems, and other events that cannot always be prevented or anticipated. Many of the processes include biological systems, which add significant complexity, as compared to chemical synthesis. We expect that, from time to time, consistent with biotechnology industry expectations, certain production lots will fail to produce product that meets our quality control release acceptance criteria. To date, our historical failure rates for all of our product programs have been within our expectations, which are based on industry norms. If the failure rate increased substantially, we could experience increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense investigating the cause and, depending upon the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred.\nIn order to produce product within our time and cost parameters, we must continue to produce product within our expected success rate and yield expectations. Because of the complexity of our manufacturing processes, it may be difficult or impossible for us to determine the cause of any particular lot failure and we must effectively take corrective action in response to any failure in a timely manner.\nWe currently rely on third parties for portions of the manufacture of each of our products. If those manufacturers are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or satisfy demand outside of or in excess of the contractual obligations, we may be unable to meet demand for these products or sell these products at all and we may lose potential revenue. Further, the availability of suitable contract manufacturing capacity at scheduled or optimum times is not certain.\nIn addition, our manufacturing processes subject us to a variety of federal, state, supranational, national, and local laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes resulting from their use. We incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations.\nSupply interruptions may disrupt our inventory levels and the availability of our products and product candidates and cause delays in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, or harm our business by reducing our revenues.\nWe depend on single-source suppliers for critical raw materials and a limited number of manufacturing facilities to manufacture our finished products and product candidates. Numerous factors could cause interruptions in the supply or manufacture of our products and product candidates, including:\n•timing, scheduling and prioritization of production by our contract manufacturers or a breach of our agreements by our contract manufacturers;\n•labor interruptions;\n•changes in our sources for manufacturing;\n•the timing and delivery of shipments;\n•our failure to locate and obtain replacement suppliers and manufacturers as needed on a timely basis; and\n•conditions affecting the cost and availability of raw materials, including inflation.\nIf one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails or refuses to supply us with necessary raw materials or finished products or product candidates on a timely basis or at all, it would take a significant amount of time and expense to qualify a new supplier or manufacturer. We may not be able to obtain active ingredients or finished products from new suppliers or manufacturers on acceptable terms and at reasonable prices, or at all.\nAny interruption in the supply of finished products could hinder our ability to distribute finished products to meet commercial demand and adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nWith respect to our product candidates, production of product is necessary to perform clinical trials and successful registration batches are necessary to file for approval to commercially market and sell product candidates. Delays in obtaining clinical material or registration batches could adversely impact our clinical trials and delay regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nIf our Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales Agreement with Sanofi were terminated, we could be prevented from continuing to commercialize ALDURAZYME or our ability to successfully commercialize ALDURAZYME would be delayed or diminished.\nEither party may terminate the Manufacturing, Marketing and Sales Agreement (the MMS Agreement) between Sanofi and us related to ALDURAZYME for specified reasons, including if the other party is in material breach of the MMS Agreement, has experienced a change of control, as such term is defined in the MMS Agreement, or has declared bankruptcy and also is in breach of the MMS Agreement. Although we are not currently in breach of the MMS Agreement, there is a risk that either party could breach the MMS Agreement in the future. Either party may also terminate the MMS Agreement upon one-year prior written notice for any reason.\nIf the MMS Agreement is terminated for breach, the breaching party will transfer its interest in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC to the non-breaching party, and the non-breaching party will pay a specified buyout amount for the breaching party’s interest in ALDURAZYME and in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC. If we are the breaching party, we would lose our rights to ALDURAZYME and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals. If the MMS Agreement is terminated without cause, the non-terminating party would have the option, exercisable for one year, to buy out the terminating party’s interest in ALDURAZYME and in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC at a specified buyout amount. If such option is not exercised, all rights to ALDURAZYME will be sold and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC will be dissolved. In the event of termination of the buyout option without exercise by the non-terminating party as described above, all right and title to ALDURAZYME is to be sold to the highest bidder, with the proceeds to be split between Sanofi and us in accordance with our percentage interest in the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC.\nIf the MMS Agreement is terminated by either party because the other party declared bankruptcy, the terminating party would be obligated to buy out the other party and would obtain all rights to ALDURAZYME exclusively. If the MMS Agreement is terminated by a party because the other party experienced a change of control, the terminating party shall notify the other party, the offeree, of its intent to buy out the offeree’s interest in ALDURAZYME and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC for a stated amount set by the terminating party at its discretion. The offeree must then either accept this offer or agree to buy the terminating party’s interest in ALDURAZYME and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC on those same terms. The party who buys out the other party would then have exclusive worldwide rights to ALDURAZYME. The Amended and Restated Collaboration Agreement between us and Sanofi will automatically terminate upon the effective date of the termination of the MMS Agreement and may not be terminated independently from the MMS Agreement.\nIf we were obligated or given the option to buy out Sanofi’s interest in ALDURAZYME and the BioMarin/Genzyme LLC, and thereby gain exclusive rights to ALDURAZYME, we may not have sufficient funds to do so and we may not be able to obtain the financing to do so. If we fail to buy out Sanofi’s interest, we may be held in breach of the agreement and may lose any claim to the rights to ALDURAZYME and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals. We would then effectively be prohibited from developing and commercializing ALDURAZYME. If this happened, not only would our product revenues decrease, but our share price would also decline.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe conduct a significant amount of our operations and generate a significant percentage of our sales outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the sales of our products are generated from countries other than the U.S., and we expect international markets will continue to be important for the sales of any products approved in the future. We have operations in Canada and in several European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and Latin American countries. We expect that we will continue to expand our international operations in the future. International operations inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n•the increased complexity and costs inherent in managing international operations;\n•diverse regulatory and compliance requirements, and changes in those requirements that could restrict our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products;\n•geopolitical and economic instability, such as the instability caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East;\n•diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;\n•trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n•difficulty in staffing and managing international operations;\n•differing labor regulations and business practices;\n•parallel trade in our products, such as importation of our products, whether legally or illegally, from countries where our products are sold at lower prices into countries where the products are sold at higher prices;\n•potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n•changes in international medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n•financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and potential currency controls imposed by non-U.S. governments;\n•regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors’ and service providers’ activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA); and\n•rapidly evolving global laws and regulations relating to data protection and the privacy and security of commercial and personal information.\nAny of these factors may, individually or as a group, have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. For example, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the related impacts to Ukraine’s infrastructure and healthcare system has significantly impacted our ability to provide our therapies to patients in Ukraine. Sanctions issued by the U.S. and other countries against Russia and Belarus in response to the attack on Ukraine and related counter-sanctions issued by Russia have made it very difficult for us to operate in Russia and may have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell our products and/or collect receivables from customers in Russia and Belarus. \nAs we continue to expand our existing international operations, we may encounter new risks. For example, as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions, we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies. If we are not successful in developing and maintaining these relationships, we may not be able to grow sales in these geographic regions. These or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nA significant portion of our international sales are made based on special access programs, and changes to these programs could adversely affect our product sales and revenues in these countries.\nWe make a significant portion of our initial international sales of newly launched products through early access, special access or “named patient sales” programs in markets where we are not required to obtain regulatory approval before establishing these programs. For example, a significant portion of our international sales of VOXZOGO since the product’s launch have been made through such programs but have, or are in the process, of being officially approved for national reimbursement in countries where patient numbers are sufficient for it to apply. The specifics of the programs vary from country to country. Generally, special approval must be obtained to initiate such programs, and in some cases, special approval must be obtained for each patient. The approval normally requires an application to national competent authorities in which the product is intended to be supplied or a lawsuit accompanied by evidence of medical need.\nThese programs are not well defined in some countries and are subject to changes in requirements, funding levels, unmet medical need and classification of the disease treated by our product. Any change to these programs could adversely affect our \nability to sell our products in those countries and delay sales. If the programs are not funded by the respective government, there could be insufficient funds to pay for all patients. Further, governments have and may continue to undertake unofficial measures to limit purchases of our products, including initially denying coverage for purchasers, delaying orders, requiring additional in-country testing and denying or taking excessively long to approve customs clearance. Any such actions could materially delay or reduce our revenues from such countries.\nWithout the special access programs, we would need to seek full product approval or official reimbursement to commercially market and sell our products in certain jurisdictions. This can be an expensive and time-consuming process and may subject our products to additional price controls. Because the number of patients is so small in some countries, it may not be economically feasible to seek, obtain and maintain a full product approval or official reimbursement, and therefore the sales in such country would be permanently reduced or eliminated. For all of these reasons, if the special access programs that we are currently using are eliminated or restricted, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations pose currency risks, which may adversely affect our operating results and net income.\nA significant and growing portion of our revenues and earnings, as well as our substantial international assets and liabilities, are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. As we operate in multiple foreign currencies, including the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Russian Ruble, the Colombian Peso, the Argentine Peso and several other currencies, changes in those currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar (USD) will impact our revenues and expenses. If the USD were to weaken against another currency, assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would increase, having a positive impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would increase, having a negative impact on earnings. Conversely, if the USD were to strengthen against another currency (as was the case for many currencies in 2022), assuming all other variables remained constant, our revenues would decrease, having a negative impact on earnings, and our overall expenses would decrease, having a positive impact on earnings. In addition, because our financial statements are reported in USD, changes in currency exchange rates between the USD and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. Therefore, significant changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results and our financial guidance.\nWe implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates. However, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. These risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nU.S. export control and economic sanctions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, compliance with such regulatory requirements may increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to sell our products and collect cash from customers.\nOur products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Exports of our products and solutions must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. Changes to these laws and regulations, or to the countries, governments, persons or activities targeted by such laws, could result in decreased use of our products, or hinder our ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers, which would likely adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives. For example, sanctions issued by the U.S. and other jurisdictions against Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion of Ukraine have made it very difficult for us to operate in Russia and may have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell our products and/or collect receivables from customers in Russia and Belarus. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges and fines.\nWe rely on a general license from OFAC to sell our medicines for eventual use by hospital and clinic end-users in Iran. The use of this OFAC general license requires us to observe strict conditions with respect to products sold, end-user limitations and payment requirements. Although we believe we have maintained compliance with the general license requirements, there can be no assurance that the general license will not be revoked, the general license will be renewed in the future or we will remain in compliance with the general license. A violation of the OFAC general license could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or strategic objectives.\nMoreover, U.S. export control and economic sanctions may make operating in certain countries more difficult and expensive. For example, we may be unable to find distributors or financial institutions willing to facilitate the sale of our products and collection of cash from such sales in a cost-effective manner, if at all.\nFailure to comply with applicable anti-corruption legislation could result in fines, criminal penalties and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the FCPA in the U.S. and other similar laws in other countries in which we do business. We operate in a number of countries that are recognized to have a reputation for corruption and pose an increased risk of corrupt practices. We also regularly interact with government regulators in many countries, including those that are considered higher risk for corruption, in order to secure regulatory approval to manufacture and distribute our products. The anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws to which we are subject generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. government officials or other persons for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business and/or other benefits. These laws also require us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered non-U.S. government officials for purposes of applicable anti-corruption laws.\nAlthough we have adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and third-party agents will comply with such laws, there can be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively at all times or protect us against liability under these or other laws for actions taken by our employees, partners and other third parties with respect to our business. If we are not in compliance with anti-corruption laws and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities and/or officials (including local laws), we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects. Investigations of any actual or alleged violations of such laws or policies related to us could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nMoreover, there has been enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third-party independent charities that provide such assistance. There has also been enhanced scrutiny by governments on reimbursement support offerings, clinical education programs and promotional speaker programs. If we, our third-party agents or donation recipients are deemed to have failed to comply with laws, regulations or government guidance in any of these areas, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. Any similar violations by our competitors could also negatively impact our industry reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our products. \nWe face credit risks from government-owned or sponsored customers outside of the U.S. that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur product sales to government-owned or supported customers in various countries outside of the U.S. are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nGlobal trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with respect to trade policies and export regulations, including import and export license requirements, trade sanctions, tariffs and international trade disputes, could adversely impact our business and operations, and reduce the competitiveness of our products and services relative to local and global competitors.\nThere is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships among the United States and the countries in which we conduct our business, that political, diplomatic, and national security factors can lead to global trade restrictions and changes in trade policies and export regulations that may adversely affect our business and operations. The United States and other countries have imposed and may continue to impose new trade restrictions and export regulations, have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods, and could significantly increase tariffs on a broad array of goods. While pharmaceutical products have customarily been granted exemptions from tariffs, recent proposals do not contemplate such exemptions. Trade restrictions and export regulations, or increases in tariffs and additional taxes, including any retaliatory measures, can negatively impact demand, increase our supply chain complexity and our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or restrict our ability to sell products, provide services or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, any or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or preserve our market shares.\nWhere appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our technology. Patent protection may not be available for some of the products we are developing. If we must spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business and financial prospects may be harmed.\nThe patent positions of biopharmaceutical products are complex and uncertain. The scope and extent of patent protection for some of our products and product candidates are particularly uncertain because key information on some of our product candidates has existed in the public domain for many years. The composition and genetic sequences of animal and/or human versions of ALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME and many of our product candidates have been published and are believed to be in the public domain. The chemical structure of 6R-BH4 (the active ingredient in KUVAN) has also been published. Publication of this information may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to our products and product candidates, including without limitation composition-of-matter patents, which are generally believed to offer the strongest patent protection.\nWe own or have licensed patents and patent applications related to our products. However, these patents and patent applications do not ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including without limitation the following:\n•With respect to pending patent applications, unless and until actually issued, the protective value of these applications is impossible to determine. We do not know whether our patent applications will result in issued patents.\n•Patents have limited duration and expire. \n•Enforcing patents is expensive and may absorb significant time of our management. Management would spend less time and resources on developing products, which could increase our operating expenses and delay product programs.\n•Receipt of a patent may not provide much, if any, practical protection. For example, if we receive a patent with a narrow scope, then it will be easier for competitors to design products that do not infringe on our patent.\n•The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011, which reformed certain patent laws in the U.S., may create additional uncertainty. Among the significant changes are switching from a “first-to-invent” system to a “first-to-file” system, and the implementation of new procedures that permit competitors to challenge our patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office after grant.\nIn addition, we have pursued, and may in the future pursue, litigation, administrative challenges or other types of proceedings to protect our patents and intellectual property rights. Such proceedings are often protracted and expensive, and have an unpredictable outcome.\nOur current and former employees, consultants or contractors may unintentionally or willfully disclose trade secrets to competitors. Enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, as with patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, requires significant resources and has an unpredictable outcome. In addition, courts outside of the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Additionally, if our employees, consultants or contractors use generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to develop our proprietary technology and compounds, it may impact our ability to obtain or successfully defend certain intellectual property rights. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, in which case we would not be able to enforce our trade secret rights against such competitors.\nIn the EU, materials we submit to the EMA in connection with our clinical trials that were traditionally regarded as confidential, proprietary information, such as study protocols, information regarding manufacturing methods and controls, and intermediate data analyses, are now subject to public disclosure. Moreover, clinical trial data submitted to the EMA in our MAAs are also available to the public. We are only permitted to redact from public disclosures commercially confidential information, a standard which is construed narrowly and subject to the interpretation and final decision of the EU regulatory authorities. EU regulations have resulted and will continue to result in the EMA’s public disclosure of certain of our proprietary information related to recently completed and future clinical trials and MAA submissions. The move toward public disclosure of such development information could adversely affect our business in many ways, including, for example, resulting in the disclosure of our confidential methodologies for development of our products, preventing us from obtaining intellectual property right protection for innovations, requiring us to allocate significant resources to prevent other companies from violating our intellectual property rights, adding even more complexity to processing health data from clinical trials consistent with applicable data privacy regulations, increasing scrutiny of our product candidates and products, and enabling competitors to use our clinical trial information and data to gain approvals for their own products.\nCompetitors or other third parties may interfere with our patent process in a variety of ways. Competitors or other third parties may claim that they invented the claimed invention prior to us or that they filed their application for a patent on a claimed invention before we did. Competitors or other third parties may also claim that we are infringing on their patents and therefore we cannot practice our technology. Competitors or other third parties may also contest our patents by showing the patent examiner or a court that the invention was not original, was not novel or was obvious, for example. In litigation, any such party could claim that our issued patents are not valid or are unenforceable for a number of reasons. If a court agrees, we would not be able to enforce that patent. Moreover, follow-on manufacturers, including generic and biosimilar manufacturers, may use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on versions of our products notwithstanding our filed patents or patent applications.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, third parties could develop competing products, which could adversely affect our revenues and financial results generally.\nCompetitors and other third parties may have developed intellectual property that could limit our ability to market and commercialize our products and product candidates, if approved.\nSimilar to us, competitors and other third parties continually seek intellectual property protection for their technology. Several of our products and development programs focus on therapeutic areas that have been the subject of extensive research and development by third parties for many years. Due to the amount of intellectual property in our field of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties granted or created in the future. For example, if a patent holder believes our product infringes its patent, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology. If someone else claims we infringe their intellectual property, we would face a number of issues, including the following:\n•Defending a lawsuit takes significant executive resources and can be very expensive.\n•If a court decides that our product infringes a competitor’s intellectual property, we may have to pay substantial damages.\n•With respect to patents, in addition to requiring us to pay substantial damages, a court may prohibit us from making, selling, offering to sell, importing or using our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us. The patent holder is not required to grant us a license. If a license is available, it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. For example, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents and patent applications.\n•We may need to redesign our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. \n•Redesigning our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.\nWe may also support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations, hospitals, universities or other educational institutions. These research partners may be unwilling to grant us any exclusive rights to technology or products derived from these collaborations. For example, under the Bayh-Dole Act which only applies to patents for inventions generated from federally funded research, the U.S. Department of Commerce may allow the government to use “march-in” rights for prescription drug patents as a means to control prices.\nIf we do not obtain required licenses or rights, we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or may be prohibited from making, using, importing, offering to sell or selling products requiring these licenses or rights. There is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties. If we are not able to resolve such disputes and obtain the licenses or rights we need, we may not be able to develop or market our products.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile, and an investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile. Our valuation and stock price may have no meaningful relationship to current or historical earnings, asset values, book value or many other criteria based on conventional measures of stock value. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and in the future could fluctuate, due to factors including: \n•product sales and profitability of our products;\n•manufacturing, supply or distribution of our product candidates and products;\n•progress of our product candidates through the regulatory process and our ability to successfully commercialize any such products that receive regulatory approval;\n•results of clinical trials, announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n•generic competition to KUVAN tablets and powder described above in this Risk Factors section or potential generic competition from future competitors;\n•government regulatory action affecting our product candidates, our products or our competitors’ product candidates and products in both the U.S. and non-U.S. countries;\n•developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights;\n•general market conditions and fluctuations for the emerging growth and pharmaceutical market sectors;\n•economic conditions in the U.S. or abroad;\n•negative publicity about us or the pharmaceutical industry;\n•changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n•cybersecurity incidents experienced by us or others in our industry;\n•broad market fluctuations in the U.S., the EU or in other parts of the world;\n•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, including due to timing of large periodic orders for our products by governments in certain countries;\n•changes in company assessments or financial estimates by securities analysts;\n•certain actions by activist investors that may be threatened or commenced against us;\n•acquisitions of products, businesses, or other assets; \n•industry, financial analyst, or investor reaction to public announcements by us or our competitors; and\n•sales of our shares of stock by us, our significant stockholders, or members of our management or Board of Directors.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In some cases, these fluctuations have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, in September 2020, after a substantial drop in our stock price that followed an announcement providing a regulatory update regarding ROCTAVIAN, we and certain of our officers were sued in a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false or misleading statements. We may be the target of additional litigation of this type in the future as well. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. \nIn addition, our stock price can be materially adversely affected by factors beyond our control, such as disruptions in global financial markets or negative trends in the biotechnology sector of the economy, even if our business is operating well.\nConversion of the 2027 Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their 2027 Notes, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 2027 Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2027 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2027 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2027 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of the 2027 Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take us over.\nThe terms of the 2027 Notes require us to offer to repurchase the 2027 Notes in the event of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes). A takeover of us would trigger options by the respective holders of the 2027 Notes to require us to repurchase such 2027 Notes. This may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders or investors in the 2027 Notes.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware. Certain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of us more difficult, even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders. Our anti-takeover provisions include provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws providing that stockholders’ meetings may only be called by our Chairman, the lead independent director or the majority of our Board of Directors and that the stockholders may not take action by written consent and requiring that stockholders that desire to nominate any person for election to our Board of Directors or to make any proposal with respect to business to be conducted at a meeting of our stockholders be submitted in appropriate form to our Secretary within a specified period of time in advance of any such meeting. Additionally, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders. The rights of holders of our common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued. The issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a \nbusiness combination with any holders of 15% or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless, among other possibilities, our Board of Directors approves the transaction. Our Board of Directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of us. Also, under applicable Delaware law, our Board of Directors may adopt additional anti-takeover measures in the future.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the U.S. as the exclusive forums for the adjudication of certain disputes, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n•any derivative claim or cause of action brought on our behalf;\n•any claim or cause of action for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of BioMarin to us or our stockholders;\n•any claim or cause of action against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; any claim or cause of action seeking to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;\n•any claim or cause of action as to which the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and\n•any claim or cause of action against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. \nThis exclusive-forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the U.S. of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nWhile the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated bylaws. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either of our exclusive forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business. Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that any person or entity that acquires any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of such provisions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur future growth and success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract, retain, manage and motivate our employees. The loss of the services of a significant portion of our workforce or any member of our senior management or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nBecause of the specialized nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. In particular, the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us if we do not have an adequate succession plan or if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. While our senior executive officers are parties to employment agreements with us, these agreements do not guarantee that they will remain employed with us in the future. In addition, in many cases, these agreements do not restrict our senior executive officers’ ability to compete with us after their employment is terminated. We have experienced changes to our management team starting with the appointment of Alexander Hardy as our new President and Chief Executive Officer in December 2023. Since then, Cristin Hubbard was appointed as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer in May 2024, Dr. Greg Friberg was appointed as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Research & Development Officer in September 2024, and Dr. James Sabry was appointed as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Business Officer in October 2024. The recent changes in our \nmanagement team, organizational structure, and corporate strategy could cause retention and morale concerns among current employees, and may create operational risks. \nThe competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. Recently, like many other employers in the U.S., we experienced increased employee turnover. Due to the intense competition for talent, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel. Additionally, we cannot be sure that the compensation costs of doing so will not adversely affect our operating results, and we may not be able to hire and train employees quickly enough to meet our needs. Moreover, during the second and third quarters of 2024, we announced reductions in our global workforce by an aggregate of approximately 395 employees. As a result, we could face employee attrition beyond our intended reductions in force and adverse effects on employee morale, diversion of management attention, and adverse effects to our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire employees in the future. If we fail to retain employees and effectively manage our hiring needs, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts, employee morale, productivity, and the success of our strategic plans could suffer, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nNew tax laws or regulations that are enacted or existing tax laws and regulations that are interpreted, modified or applied adversely to us or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nNew tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, and existing tax laws or regulations could be interpreted, modified or applied in a manner that is adverse to us or our customers, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the Inflation Reduction Act enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to such legislation may affect us, and certain aspects of such legislation could be repealed or modified in future legislation. Among other changes, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amended the Code to require that, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021, certain research and experimental expenditures be capitalized and amortized over five years if incurred in the United States or fifteen years if incurred in foreign jurisdictions. Although the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would defer, modify, or repeal the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that such changes will be made. If the requirement is not deferred, repealed or otherwise modified, it may increase our cash tax. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to federal tax laws. Any future tax legislation could increase our U.S. tax expense and could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nMoreover, changes in the tax laws of jurisdictions in which we conduct business could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that is being led by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and other initiatives led by the OECD or the EC. For example, the OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries including the U.S. and other countries in which we have operations, is working on proposals, commonly referred to as “BEPS 2.0”, which, to the extent implemented, would make important changes to the international tax system. These proposals are based on two “pillars”, Pillar One focuses on the allocation of taxing rights in respect of certain profits of multinational enterprises with annual global revenue above 20 billion euros and profitability above 10% to the jurisdictions within which they carry on business (based on the thresholds, we currently expect to be outside the scope of the Pillar One proposals, but could fall within their scope in the future) and Pillar Two imposes a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on certain multinational enterprises that have consolidated revenues of at least 750 million euros in at least two out of the last four years (based on the thresholds, we currently expect that we are likely to fall within the scope of the Pillar Two proposals). A number of countries in which we conduct business have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, core elements of Pillar Two rules. The OECD has issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of Pillar Two. We continue to monitor developments and evaluate the potential impacts of these new rules, including on our effective tax rates and our eligibility to qualify for these transition and safe harbor rules. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm’s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. If tax authorities successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arm’s length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, resulting in a higher tax liability. In addition, if a country from which income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both that country and the other country to which the income was allocated could tax the same income, potentially resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are found in violation of healthcare laws, we may be required to pay penalties, be subjected to scrutiny by regulators or governmental entities, or be suspended from participation in government healthcare programs, which may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, and laws related to ensuring compliance. In the U.S., the federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a pharmaceutical company, to knowingly and willfully offer, solicit, pay or receive any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and \nMedicaid. Under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and related regulations, certain arrangements are deemed not to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute if they fit within a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. However, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration not intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from Anti-Kickback liability, although we seek to comply with these safe harbors. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payers. As first disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting that we produce certain documents regarding our sponsored testing programs relating to VIMIZIM and NAGLAZYME. We have produced documents in response to the subpoena and are cooperating fully, but there is no assurance that such sponsored testing programs, or our other operations or programs, will not be found to violate such laws.\nFederal and state false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. \nUnder the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), we also are prohibited from, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payers, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nIn addition, federal and state healthcare legislation have strengthened these laws in the U.S. For example, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them in order to commit a violation. Moreover, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, integrity, availability, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Many state and non-U.S. laws also govern the privacy and security of health information. They often differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. The global data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In the U.S., state privacy laws and regulations impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other sensitive personal information that is not subject to HIPAA. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sales, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. \nSubstantial new laws and regulations affecting compliance have also been adopted in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. countries, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. For example, in the U.S., the PPACA, through the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, requires certain drug, biologicals and medical supply manufacturers to collect and report to CMS information on payments or transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as investment and ownership interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. In addition, there has been a trend of increased state regulation of payments made to physicians. Certain states and/or local jurisdictions mandate implementation of compliance programs, compliance with the Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians, marketing expenditures, and drug pricing. Likewise, in many non-U.S. countries there is an increasing focus on the relationship between drug companies and healthcare practitioners. Recently enacted non-U.S. legislation creates reporting obligations on payments, gifts and benefits made to these professionals. Outside the U.S., interactions between pharmaceutical companies and health care professionals are also governed by strict laws, such as national anti-bribery laws of European countries, national sunshine rules, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct. The shifting regulatory environment and the need to implement systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the costs of maintaining compliance and the possibility that we may violate one or more of the requirements and be subject to fines or sanctions.\nDue to the breadth of the healthcare laws described above, the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions and safe harbors and the increased focus by law enforcement authorities in enforcing such laws, our business activities \ncould be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, public reprimands, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, curtailment of our operations, and debarment, suspension or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe, and the third parties with whom we work, are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and rules, contractual obligations, industry standards, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations by us or the third parties with whom we work could lead to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm, loss of revenue or profits, and other adverse business consequences.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share (collectively, process) personal data and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, data we collect about trial participants in connection with clinical trials, sensitive third-party data, business plans, transactions, financial information and medical information collected by our patient access management team (collectively, sensitive data). Our data processing activities subject us to certain data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements, and other obligations relating to data privacy and security. \nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For example, HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Additionally, numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling, and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for fines for intentional violations and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. Although some U.S. comprehensive privacy laws exempt some data processed in the context of clinical trials, these laws may increase compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal data we may maintain about California residents. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels, and we expect more jurisdictions to pass similar laws in the future. \nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards may govern data privacy and security. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR), United Kingdom’s GDPR (UK GDPR) (collectively, the GDPR), Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) (Law No. 13,709/2018), and China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) impose strict requirements for processing personal data. For example, under the GDPR, companies may face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to 20 million Euros under the EU GDPR / 17.5 million pounds sterling under the UK GDPR or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests.\nIn addition, we may be unable to transfer personal data from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries due to data localization requirements or limitations on cross-border data flows. Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal data to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the United States and other countries whose privacy laws it believes are inadequate. Other jurisdictions have adopted may adopt similarly stringent data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance with law, such as the EEA standard contractual clauses, the UK’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework), these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. If there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal data from the EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions to the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face significant adverse consequences, including by limiting our ability to conduct clinical trial activities in Europe and elsewhere, the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate part of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions (such as Europe) at significant expense, increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work with partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of \npersonal data necessary to operate our business. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers of personal data to recipients outside Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data to recipients outside of the EEA and/or UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from regulators individual litigants and activist groups.\nWe are subject to new laws governing the privacy of consumer health data, including reproductive, sexual orientation, and gender identity privacy rights that provide consumers certain rights with respect to their health data and create a private right of action to allow individuals to sue for violations. \nOur employees and personnel, as well as third parties with whom we work, use, or may in the future use, generative AI technologies to perform their work, and the disclosure and use of personal data in generative AI technologies is subject to various privacy laws and other privacy obligations. Governments have passed and are likely to pass additional laws regulating generative AI. Our use of this technology could result in additional compliance costs, regulatory investigations and actions, and lawsuits. If these factors limit or otherwise impair our effective use of generative AI, it could make our business less efficient and result in competitive disadvantages.\nIn addition to data privacy and security laws, we are contractually subject to industry standards adopted by industry groups and may become subject to additional such obligations in the future. We are also bound by other contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials, and other statements, such as statements related to compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. Regulators in the United States are increasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if these policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, misleading, or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences. \nObligations related to data privacy and security (and consumers’ data privacy expectations) are quickly changing, becoming increasingly stringent, and creating uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources and may necessitate changes to our services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. \nWe may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our data privacy and security obligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties with whom we work may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third parties with whom we work fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class-action claims) and mass arbitration demands; additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; bans or restrictions on processing personal data; and orders to destroy or not use personal data. In particular, plaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims against companies, including class claims. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for monumental statutory damages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to loss of customers; inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to develop or commercialize our products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity; or substantial changes to our business model or operations.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities.\nWe are exposed to the potential product liability risks inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals. We currently maintain insurance against product liability lawsuits for the commercial sale of our products and for the clinical trials of our product candidates. Pharmaceutical companies must balance the cost of insurance with the level of coverage based on estimates of potential liability. Historically, the potential liability associated with product liability lawsuits for pharmaceutical products has been unpredictable. Although we believe that our current insurance is a reasonable estimate of our potential liability and represents a commercially reasonable balancing of the level of coverage as compared to the cost of the insurance, we may be subject to claims in connection with our clinical trials and commercial use of our products and product candidates for which our insurance coverage may not be adequate and we may be unable to avoid significant liability if any product liability lawsuit is brought against us. If we are the subject of a successful product liability claim that exceeds the limits of any insurance coverage we obtain, we may incur substantial charges that would adversely affect our earnings and require the commitment of capital resources that might otherwise be available for the development and commercialization of our product programs.\nIn the EU, new rules on liability of defective products were adopted and came into force in December 2024. These rules apply to products placed on the market or put into service as of December 9, 2025, and makes it easier for patients to claim damages for defective products, for example by alleviating their burden of proof.\nWe, and the third parties with whom we work, rely significantly on information technology systems and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively and have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on our information technology systems, including enterprise resource planning (ERP), production management, and other information systems, to effectively manage and maintain our operations, inventory and internal reports, to manufacture and ship products to customers and to timely invoice them. \nIn addition, our technology systems, including our cloud technologies, continue to increase in multitude and complexity, making them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, cyberattack and other disruptions. Potential problems or interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded technology systems or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could disrupt or reduce, and has in the past disrupted or reduced, the efficiency of our operations and expose us to greater risk of security breaches. Cybersecurity incidents resulting in the failure of our ERP system, production management or other systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security or other unauthorized access or unavailability of these systems or those of any third parties in our supply chain or on whom we otherwise depend, have occurred in the past and may affect our ability in the future to manage and maintain our operations, inventory and internal reports, and result in delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations. In particular, we have implemented certain modules of a new global ERP system and will continue to implement other components of the new system, which has replaced, and will continue to replace, legacy operating and financial systems. The preparation and implementation of a new ERP system has required, and will continue to require, significant investment of capital and human resources. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we continue to experience delays or cost overruns during the implementation process, or if the ERP system or associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect. Potential failure or flaws in the new ERP system may pose risks to our ability to operate successfully and efficiently and failure to implement the appropriate internal controls with respect to the new ERP system may result in the system producing inaccurate or unreliable information. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design or implementation of the new ERP system or related internal controls, or in the performance of legacy information technology systems, could result in potentially much higher costs than we had incurred and adversely affect our ability to effectively fulfill contractual obligations, file related government reports in a timely manner, operate and manage our business or otherwise affect our controls environment. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs part of our business, we collect, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information, proprietary data, intellectual property, and personal data. The information and data processed and stored in our technology systems, and those of our research collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, or other third parties on whom we depend on to operate our business, may be vulnerable to loss, damage, denial-of-service, unauthorized access or misappropriation. Security incidents may be the result of unauthorized or unintended activity (or lack of activity) by our employees, contractors, or others with authorized access to our network or unauthorized activity such as malware, hacking, business email compromise, phishing and other social engineering attacks (including deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake), ransomware or other cyberattacks. In particular, severe ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, ability to provide our products or services, loss of sensitive data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. Remote work has also increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as our employees utilize network connections, computers and devices outside our premises or network, including working at home, while in transit and in public locations.\nFuture or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate companies into our information technology environment and security program.\nWhile we have implemented measures to protect our information systems and data stored in those systems and those of the third parties with whom we work, our efforts may not be successful. It may also be difficult and/or costly to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a security incident. Our efforts to do so may not be successful. Actions taken by us or the third parties with whom we work to detect, investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate a security incident could result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our business. We rely on third parties to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, clinical trial functions, manufacturing partners, and other functions. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If the third parties with whom we work experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we may be entitled to damages if the third parties with whom we work fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award.\nWe take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information systems (such as our hardware and/or software, including that of third parties with whom we work). We may not, however, detect and remediate all such vulnerabilities including on a timely basis. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures and patches designed to address identified vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities could be exploited and result in a security incident.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to our sensitive information or our information technology systems, or those of the third parties with whom we work. We have experienced and may continue to experience security incidents, although to our knowledge we have not experienced any material incident or interruption to date. If such a significant event were to occur, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and commercial operations, including due to a loss, corruption or unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets, personal data or other proprietary or sensitive information. Further, these cybersecurity incidents can lead to the public disclosure of personal information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, clinical trial patients and others and result in demands for ransom or other forms of blackmail. Such attacks, including phishing attacks and attempts to misappropriate or compromise confidential or proprietary information or sabotage enterprise IT systems, are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including industrial espionage) and expertise, including by organized criminal groups, “hacktivists”, nation states and others. Moreover, the costs to us to investigate and mitigate cybersecurity incidents could be significant. For example, the loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our product development or regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Any security breach that results in the unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal data may require us to notify individuals, governmental authorities, credit reporting agencies, or other parties pursuant to privacy and security laws and regulations or other obligations. Such a security compromise could harm our reputation, erode confidence in our information security measures, and lead to regulatory scrutiny. To the extent that any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of, or damage to, our data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or personal information, we could be exposed to a risk of loss, enforcement measures, penalties, fines, indemnification claims, litigation and potential civil or criminal liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNot all our contracts contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information about us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our organization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position.\nIf a natural disaster, terrorist or criminal activity or other unforeseen event caused significant damage to our facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers or significantly disrupted our operations or those of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue, have reduced margins, or be forced to terminate a program.\nThe occurrence of an earthquake, wildfire, or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment, or that of our third-party manufacturers or single-source suppliers, which could materially impair the ability for us or our third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products and product candidates. Our Galli Drive facility, located in Novato, California, is currently our only manufacturing facility for ALDURAZYME, NAGLAZYME, VOXZOGO and PALYNZIQ and is one of two manufacturing facilities for BRINEURA and VIMIZIM. Our gene therapy manufacturing facility is also located in Novato, California, and it is currently our only manufacturing facility to support ROCTAVIAN. These facilities are located in the San Francisco Bay Area near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes. We, the third-party manufacturers with whom we contract and our single-source suppliers of raw materials, which include many of our critical raw materials, are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including fires, explosions, floods, and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, or any terrorist or criminal activity caused significant damage to our facilities or the facilities of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers, our ability to manufacture our products, or to have our products manufactured, could be seriously, or potentially completely, impaired, and our commercialization efforts and revenues could be seriously impaired. \nMoreover, other unforeseen events, such as power outages, could significantly disrupt our operations or those of our third-party manufacturers and suppliers, which could result in damage to our facilities and significant delays in the manufacture of our products and adversely impact our commercial operations and revenues. The insurance that we carry, the inventory that we maintain and our risk mitigation plans may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions.\nOur business is affected by macroeconomic conditions.\nVarious macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates, or foreign currency exchange rates, natural disasters, geopolitical instability resulting from war, terrorism and other violence, such as the instability caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East, tariffs and trade tensions, effects of potential global public health threats and overall economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets and volatility and disruptions in the equity and debt markets. For instance, COVID-19 previously adversely affected our ability to source materials and supplies. Inflation (such as that recently observed in the U.S. and elsewhere) has increased our business costs and could become more significant in the future, and it may not be feasible to pass price increases on to our customers due to the process by which healthcare providers are reimbursed for our products by the government. Interest rates, the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate our investments in order to fund our operations. We purchase or enter into a variety of financial instruments and transactions, including investments in commercial paper, the extension of credit to corporations, institutions and governments and hedging contracts. If any of the issuers or counterparties to these instruments were to default on their obligations, it could materially reduce the value of the transaction and adversely affect our cash flows.\nWe sell our products in countries that face economic volatility and weakness. Although we have historically collected receivables from customers in those countries, sustained weakness or further deterioration of the local economies and currencies may cause customers in those countries to be unable to pay for our products. Additionally, if one or more of these countries were unable to purchase our products, our revenues would be adversely affected.\nInterest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of our customers/distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute our products, which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials and supplies necessary for production of our therapies. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers, sole-source or single-source suppliers to remain in business or otherwise manufacture or supply product. Failure by any of them to remain a going concern could affect our ability to manufacture products.\nAdditionally, effects of any pandemic or other global public health threat on all aspects of our business and operations and the duration of such effects are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. For instance, a global pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, which could reduce our ability to access capital and could negatively affect our liquidity and the liquidity and stability of markets for our common stock and Notes. In addition, a recession, further market correction or depression resulting from a future global public health threat could materially adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock and Notes. \nTo the extent macroeconomic conditions continue to adversely affect our business and financial results, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section, such as those relating to our conducting a significant amount of our sales and operations outside of the U.S., exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and finance our operations and the volatility of our stock price.",
