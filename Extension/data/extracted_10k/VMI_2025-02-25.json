We leverage this expertise to focus on irrigation optimization, machine health advancements, and predictive analytics. As pioneers of the mechanized irrigation industry, we maintain our leadership in innovation and remain at the forefront of integrating these technologies with our cloud-based platform. This approach delivers data-driven irrigation strategies tailored to each field and crop.\nWith AgSense® remote monitoring and control, growers can manage irrigation and ancillary equipment in real time, optimizing operations based on weather conditions, soil moisture levels, and crop needs. These tools promote efficient water use, reduce waste, and help maintain optimal growing conditions. By providing actionable data insights, we empower growers to maximize productivity while conserving valuable resources.\nMarkets\nThe market drivers for mechanized irrigation systems are fundamentally similar across North American and international regions. Purchasing an irrigation system is a capital investment, with decisions based on the anticipated return on investment. Growers who invest in mechanized irrigation systems benefit from higher crop yields due to improved irrigation practices, reduced labor costs, and lower water and energy consumption. Key factors influencing these purchasing decisions include current and projected net farm income, commodity prices, interest rates, government support programs, financing availability, and regional water regulations. In many international markets, local currency fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar can impact net farm income, as export markets are often denominated in U.S. dollars. Additionally, government-sponsored irrigation initiatives aimed at food security further drive investments in mechanized irrigation systems.\nThe demand for mechanized irrigation arises from several sources: the conversion of traditional flood irrigation systems, the replacement of older mechanized systems that are beyond their useful life or technologically obsolete, and the transition from non-irrigated land to mechanized irrigation. Water scarcity is a key driver of demand in our Agriculture segment. It is estimated that only 2.5% of the world’s total water supply is freshwater, and of that, only 30% is accessible for human use. With agriculture consuming the majority of available freshwater, efficient irrigation is essential for sustainable food production.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese conditions—along with a growing global population, improving diets, and government-backed food security programs—highlight the need for water efficient farming solutions and increased food production. We believe that mechanized irrigation can improve water application efficiency by 40% to 90% compared to traditional methods by delivering water uniformly to the root zone and minimizing runoff. Reduced runoff not only conserves water but also improves the quality of adjacent rivers, aquifers, and streams, contributing environmental benefits and supporting vital water conservation efforts.\nCompetition\nIn North America, several companies provide irrigation products and services for agricultural customers. Our company is recognized as the leader among the four main participants in the mechanized irrigation industry. Competitors differentiate themselves based on product durability, reliability, pricing and value proposition, quality, and the service capabilities of local dealers. To help growers improve crop yields, we continuously innovate and expand our technology offerings to meet evolving customer needs.\nPricing in the industry can become highly competitive, particularly during periods of low demand. In international markets, our competition includes both major U.S. companies and privately owned local businesses. While the global competitive landscape is similar to that of North America, pricing often plays a more critical role. Recognizing the local nature of competition in international markets, we maintain manufacturing facilities in key regions, which enables us to compete effectively and meet region-specific demands.\nDistribution Methods\nWe market our irrigation machines, technology offerings, and service parts through an extensive network of independent dealers. In North America, approximately 250 dealer locations serve our customers, with around 400 dealers covering international markets across more than 60 countries. Dealers assess growers’ needs, customize machine configurations, manage installation (including water and power systems), and provide ongoing support.\nTo ensure dealers can meet customer needs effectively, our technical and sales teams provide ongoing training and support. Internationally, our dealers receive additional support through regional operations in South America, South Africa, Western Europe, Australia, China, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as our manufacturing facility in Valley, Nebraska. This support structure allows us to deliver tailored solutions and maintain strong, lasting relationships with customers worldwide.\nGeneral\nCertain information generally applicable to our two reportable segments is outlined below.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nWe have achieved growth both organically and through acquisitions. Additionally, we continually refine our portfolio to enhance our operational focus. Our significant business acquisitions and divestitures during the past three fiscal years included the following (with the relevant segment noted):\n2024\n\n●   Acquired an additional 9% of ConcealFab, Inc., a 5G infrastructure and PIM mitigation solutions company in Colorado (Infrastructure)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Acquired the remaining 25% of Valmont Substations, LLC, a utility substation product provider in Kansas (Infrastructure)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Divested our extractive business, which included the manufacturing and distribution of screening products for the mining and quarrying sectors in Australia and New Zealand (Infrastructure)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Divested George Industries, a coating and anodizing company in California (Infrastructure)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2023\n\n●   Acquired HR Products, a leading wholesale supplier of irrigation parts in Australia (Agriculture)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Divested Torrent Engineering and Equipment Company, LLC, an integrator of prepackaged pump stations in Indiana (Agriculture)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2022\n\n●   Acquired 51% of ConcealFab, Inc., a 5G infrastructure and PIM mitigation solutions company in Colorado (Infrastructure)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Acquired the remaining 9% of Convert Italia S.p.A., a designer and provider of engineered solar tracker solutions in Italy (Infrastructure)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Acquired the remaining 20% of Valmont West Coast Engineering, Ltd., a manufacturer of steel and aluminum structures for the lighting, transportation, and wireless communication industries in Canada (Infrastructure)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Divested Valmont SM, an offshore wind energy structures business in Denmark (Other)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSuppliers and Availability of Raw Materials\nOur primary raw materials include hot-rolled steel coil and plate, zinc, and other carbon steel products, all essential for manufacturing across our segments. We source these materials from steel mills, steel service centers, and zinc producers, where they are generally readily available. However, recently proposed trade policies and tariffs could increase the cost of goods purchased from Canada, China, and Mexico, potentially disrupting the availability of these key raw materials. While we may experience longer lead times and price fluctuations, we do not anticipate extended shortages of steel, zinc, or natural gas. Over the past several years, we have maintained strong relationships with major steel producers and have strategically sourced steel within the same continent as our manufacturing locations, helping us avoid significant or widespread shortages.\nPatents, Licenses, Franchises, and Concessions\nWe hold patents for a variety of products, including manufacturing machinery, structures, solar trackers, highway guardrails, and irrigation systems. Additionally, we have registered trademarks associated with our products and services. While these intellectual properties are valuable to our business, we do not believe that the loss of any single patent or trademark would materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nSeasonal Factors in Business\nSales in our business can be influenced by seasonal patterns tied to the agricultural growing season and the infrastructure construction season. For mechanized irrigation equipment, sales typically peak in spring and fall, aligning with farmers’ planting and harvesting periods, and are generally lower in the summer. In contrast, sales of infrastructure products tend to increase during the summer and fall, in line with the construction season, and are usually lower in the winter.\nCustomers\nOur business does not depend on a single customer or a limited number of customers to generate a significant portion of revenue in any segment. As such, the loss of any one customer would not materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\n\n\n\n\nBacklog\nAs of December 28, 2024, our backlog of orders for principal products was $1,436.7 million, compared to $1,465.5 million as of December 30, 2023. Backlog includes confirmed customer purchase orders and executed sales order contracts. We expect the majority of the fiscal 2024 backlog to be fulfilled in fiscal 2025. The total backlog by segment as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 was as follows:\n\n         ​            ​     ​        ​      ​     ​        ​   \n---------------------------------------------------------------\n​                            December 28,   ​      December 30,\nDollars in millions   ​              2024                  2023\nInfrastructure        ​          $1,273.3   ​          $1,299.6\nAgriculture           ​             163.4   ​             165.9\nTotal backlog         ​          $1,436.7   ​          $1,465.5\nEnvironmental Protection\nWe are subject to a range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. Although we regularly incur expenses and make capital expenditures related to environmental compliance, we do not anticipate that these future expenditures will materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nNumber of Employees\nAs of December 28, 2024, we had a total of 10,986 employees.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur approach to human capital resources is outlined in our Code of Business Conduct, in our Human Rights Policy, and on our website at www.valmont.com.

      "text": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors describe various risks that may affect our business, financial condition, and operations.\nEconomic and Business Risks\nThe ultimate consumers of our products operate in cyclical industries, which have experienced significant downturns that have adversely impacted our sales in the past and may do so again in the future.\nOur sales are sensitive to market conditions in the industries where the ultimate consumers of our products operate. In some cases, these industries have been highly cyclical and subject to substantial downturns. For example, a significant portion of our sales of support structures is to the electric utility industry. In fiscal 2024, our sales to the U.S. electric utility industry were over $1.0 billion. Utilities may defer purchases of our products by reducing capital expenditures for reasons such as unfavorable regulatory environments, a slow U.S. economy, or financing constraints. If demand for utility structures weakens due to reduced or delayed spending on electrical generation and transmission projects, our sales and operating income are likely to decrease.\nThe end-users of our mechanized irrigation equipment are farmers. Economic changes within the agriculture industry, particularly fluctuations in farm income, can impact sales of these products. Lower levels of farm income have, at times, led to reduced demand for our mechanized irrigation and tubing products. Farm income decreases when commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, government subsidies, and export levels decline. Additionally, weather conditions—potentially worsened by climate change, such as extreme drought—can limit water availability for irrigation and influence farmers’ purchasing decisions. Higher energy and nitrogen-based fertilizer costs, driven by rising oil and natural gas prices, increase farmers’ operating expenses.\nFurthermore, uncertainty regarding future government agricultural policies may lead to indecision among farmers. Changes in government farm support programs, financing aids, and irrigation water use policies can influence the demand for our irrigation equipment. In the U.S., certain regions are considering policies that may restrict water use for irrigation. These factors could prompt farmers to delay capital expenditures for farm equipment, potentially slowing or even reversing growth in irrigation equipment and tubing sales. In February 2025, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasted U.S. net farm income for 2025 to be $180.1 billion, an increase of $41.0 billion (or 29.5%) compared to 2024. This rise is primarily due to an increase in direct government support payments, partially offset by lower cash receipts from corn and soybeans.\nWe have also experienced cyclical demand for products sold to the wireless communications industry. Sales of wireless structures and components to wireless carriers and build-to-suit companies that serve the industry have historically been cyclical. These customers may reduce spending on new capacity to focus on cash flow and capital management. Changes in the competitive structure of the wireless industry, due to industry consolidation or reorganization, may disrupt the capital plans of wireless carriers as they reassess their networks.\nDue to the cyclical nature of these markets, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in sales and operating income for a substantial portion of our product offerings. These fluctuations could be material and adversely affect our overall financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in prices and reduced availability of key commodities such as steel, aluminum, zinc, natural gas, and fuel may increase our operating costs, likely reducing our net sales and profitability.\nHot-rolled steel coil and other carbon steel products have historically constituted approximately one-third of the cost of manufacturing our products. We also use large quantities of aluminum for lighting structures and zinc for galvanizing most of our steel products. Our facilities consume large amounts of natural gas for heating and processing tanks in our galvanizing operations. Additionally, we use gasoline and diesel fuel to transport raw materials to our locations and deliver finished goods to our customers. The markets for these commodities can be volatile. The following factors increase the cost and reduce the availability of these commodities:\n\n●   increased demand, which occurs when we and other industries require greater quantities of these commodities, which can result in higher prices and longer lead times to receive them from suppliers;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   lower production levels of these commodities, due to reduced production capacities or shortages of materials needed to produce them (such as coke and scrap steel for the production of steel), which could result in reduced supplies, higher costs for us, and increased lead times;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   increased costs of major inputs, such as scrap steel, coke, iron ore, and energy;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which can impact the relative cost of these commodities, which may affect the cost effectiveness of imported materials and limit our options for acquiring them; and\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   international trade disputes, import duties, tariffs, and quotas, as we import some steel and aluminum components and products for various product lines.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncreases in the selling prices of our products may not fully recover higher commodity costs and generally lag increases in these costs. Consequently, an increase in commodity prices will increase our operating costs and likely reduce our profitability.\nRising steel prices, as seen in the first half of fiscal 2021 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, can put pressure on gross profit margins, especially in our Infrastructure segment product lines. The time between the release of a customer’s purchase order and the manufacturing of the product can span several months. Since some sales in the Infrastructure segment are fixed-price contracts, rapid increases in steel costs likely result in lower operating income. Steel prices for both hot-rolled coil and plate can also decrease substantially in a given period, as occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and much of fiscal 2022. Steel is particularly significant for our Utility product line, where the cost of steel has accounted for approximately 50% of net sales on average. Assuming a similar sales mix, a hypothetical 20% change in the price of steel would have affected our net sales in this product line by approximately $110.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024.\nWe believe recent volatility stems from increased global steel production and shifting consumption patterns, particularly in fast-growing economies like China and India. The speed with which steel suppliers impose price increases on us may prevent us from fully recovering these price increases, particularly in our L&T and Utility businesses. Similarly, rapid decreases in steel prices can result in reduced operating margins in our Utility businesses due to long production lead times.\nDemand for our infrastructure products, including coating services, is highly dependent on overall infrastructure spending.\nWe manufacture and distribute engineered infrastructure products for lighting, traffic, utility, and other specialty applications. Our Coatings product line serves various construction‑related industries. Because these products are primarily used in infrastructure projects, sales are closely tied to construction activity, which has historically been cyclical. Several factors can impact construction activity and, consequently, our sales, including:\n\n●   weakness in the general economy, which may reduce tax revenues and limit funds available for construction;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   interest rate increases, which raise the cost of construction financing; and\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   adverse weather conditions, which can delay or slow construction activity.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe current economic uncertainty in the U.S. and Europe may negatively affect our business. In our L&T product line, some lighting structure sales depend on new residential and commercial developments. When construction in these sectors slows, our light pole sales may decline. Additionally, an economic downturn in Europe, Australia, or China could reduce demand if customers in these regions face credit challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Infrastructure segment, particularly for lighting, transportation, and highway safety products, relies heavily on government funding. U.S. federal funding initiatives, such as the IIJA and IRA, bolster long-term demand for our products. However, the timing and distribution of federal infrastructure funds remain uncertain. Infrastructure spending may also decline due to factors beyond our control, including budget constraints, reduced tax revenues, and legislative delays affecting appropriations.\nWe are subject to currency fluctuations from our international sales, which can negatively impact our reported earnings.\nWe sell our products in many countries worldwide, with approximately 30% of our fiscal 2024 net sales occurring outside the U.S. These sales are often conducted in foreign currencies, primarily the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, and euro. Because our Consolidated Financial Statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and these currencies will continue to impact our reported earnings. A weaker U.S. dollar enhances our reported earnings by increasing the value of foreign revenues, whereas a stronger U.S. dollar has the opposite effect. Currency fluctuations have affected our financial performance in the past and may continue to do so in future periods. Additionally, when local currencies strengthen, the cost of imported goods decreases, potentially affecting our ability to compete profitably in domestic markets.\nWe also face risks from foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit currency conversion and restrict our ability to transfer funds from international subsidiaries. Currency devaluations can reduce the value of funds held in the affected currency. Such actions could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in any given period.\nFor further discussion on economic and business risks, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices, please refer to the “Market Risk” section within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this report.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur operations are subject to trade policies, tariffs, and trade agreements, and any further changes could adversely affect our business, potentially leading to a decline in sales and profits or the loss of certain foreign investments.\nAs a global manufacturing company, we operate over 80 manufacturing plants across six continents. In fiscal 2024, approximately 30% of our net sales came from markets outside of the U.S. Demand for our products and our profitability are influenced by global trade relations. We maintain a significant manufacturing presence in Australia, Brazil, Europe, and Mexico—regions affected by U.S. trade policies, including tariffs on a broad range of imports, as well as retaliatory measures from foreign governments, particularly China.\nRecently proposed trade policies and tariffs could increase the cost of goods that we and our suppliers purchase from Canada, China, and Mexico, which would increase our cost of goods sold. Additionally, our Mexican operations play a vital role in our Infrastructure segment, exporting approximately $230.0 million of steel structures to the U.S. in fiscal 2024. Moreover, indirect effects of trade restrictions, such as China’s tariffs on imported soybeans impacting U.S. farm income, can reduce demand for our products.\nOn February 3, 2025, U.S. President Trump announced a one-month delay in imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico. Then, on February 10, 2025, he announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., set to take effect on March 4, 2025. These actions, along with any future legislation or measures by the U.S. federal government that restrict trade, such as additional tariffs, trade barriers, or other protectionist or retaliatory measures, could adversely impact our financial results, depending on their timing and duration.\nSome of our international operations are in regions with political instability, such as the Middle East, or economic uncertainty, such as Western Europe. Managing operations across diverse geographic markets also requires hiring, training, and retaining skilled local management, which impacts both operational performance and financial reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect international sales to continue representing a significant portion of our net sales. Consequently, our foreign business operations, sales, and profits will continue to be subject to the following risks:\n\n●   political and economic instability, which may reduce the value of or lead to the loss of our investment;\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   economic recessions in key markets, potentially decreasing international sales;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   natural disasters and public health crises that could disrupt our workforce, manufacturing operations, and sales;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   increased costs and challenges related to staffing and managing international operations, impacting both profitability and reporting functions;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   potential violations of local laws or unauthorized management actions that could harm our competitive position or financial performance;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights, including patents on our manufacturing machinery, poles, and irrigation designs, outside the U.S.;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   rising tariffs, export controls, taxes, and other trade barriers, which may reduce sales and profitability; and\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   acts of war or terrorism.\n-----------------------------\nAs a result, we face the risk of losing foreign investments or experiencing a significant decline in sales and profits due to the challenges of operating in foreign markets.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption laws could result in fines, criminal penalties, and harm to our business.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act, and other similar regulations. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering improper payments or anything of value to influence government officials or private individuals to gain a business advantage, regardless of local customs or legality. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased significantly in recent years. While we have a compliance program designed to mitigate the risk of violations, any breach of these laws could result in criminal or civil penalties, damage to our reputation, and a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and operations.\nWe could incur substantial costs due to violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws.\nOur facilities and operations are subject to both U.S. and international environmental laws and regulations, including those governing air and water pollution, hazardous waste management and disposal, and contamination cleanup. Noncompliance with these laws or permit requirements could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, and investigation or remediation costs. Future regulatory changes may also require significant expenditures for compliance.\nSome of our facilities have operated for many years, during which we, and prior operators, have generated, used, handled, and disposed of hazardous materials. Contaminants have been detected at certain current and former sites, primarily linked to historical operations. Additionally, we have occasionally been identified as a potentially responsible party under Superfund or similar state laws. While we are not aware of any contaminated sites not accounted for in our Consolidated Financial Statements for known obligations, unforeseen contamination discoveries or additional cleanup requirements could result in liabilities beyond our current provisions.\nFailure to successfully commercialize or protect our intellectual property rights may materially impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe commercialization and protection of our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, proprietary processes, and other technologies are essential to maintaining our competitive position. We rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and contractual restrictions to safeguard our intellectual property. However, our ability to successfully commercialize these rights, particularly for emerging technologies, depends on applying the right business strategies.\nOur intellectual property protections may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or deemed unenforceable. Third parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our rights, and enforcing them could lead to significant, unrecoverable litigation costs. Failure to effectively commercialize or protect our intellectual property could materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have been, and may continue to be, involved in litigation or threatened litigation, the outcomes of which can be difficult to predict. These matters can be costly to defend, divert management’s attention, require payment of damages, or restrict our business operations.\nFrom time to time, we face disputes, with and without merit, that may result in significant costs and divert management’s focus and resources, even if the dispute does not proceed to litigation. The outcomes of complex legal proceedings are inherently uncertain. Additionally, complaints filed against us may not specify the damages sought, making it challenging to estimate a potential range of liabilities. Even when we can estimate losses, the actual amounts may be materially higher than expected. Resolving litigation or threatened litigation could result in substantial payments or agreements that limit our business operations. Even if we are liable in future lawsuits, the costs of defending such actions may be significant and could exceed the coverage limits or remain uncovered by our insurance policies.\nDesign patent litigation related to guardrails could reduce demand for these products and increase litigation risk.\nSome of our foreign subsidiaries in India, New Zealand, and Australia manufacture highway safety products primarily for non-U.S. markets and license certain guardrail design patents to third parties. Currently, U.S. product liability lawsuits have been filed against companies that manufacture and install specific guardrail products, some of which involve a foreign subsidiary due to its design patent. This litigation could decrease demand for these products or affect government approvals for their use, both domestically and internationally. It may also increase litigation risks for our foreign subsidiaries, negatively impacting their sales and licensing revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Risks\nWe have, from time to time, maintained a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness, which could impair our ability to operate our business, respond to changes in our operations, comply with debt covenants, and make debt payments.\nAs of December 28, 2024, we had a total of $757.9 million in outstanding indebtedness, of which $2.9 million matures within the next five fiscal years. Additionally, as of December 28, 2024, we had $799.8 million in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We occasionally borrow funds for business acquisitions and share repurchases. At times, our borrowings have been significant, with the majority of our interest‑bearing debt incurred by U.S. entities. Rising interest rates have increased our borrowing costs.\nOur level of indebtedness may have significant consequences, including:\n\n●   Our ability to meet obligations under our debt agreements could be impacted. Failure to comply with debt covenants and other requirements, including financial and restructuring terms, could result in a default under our debt agreements.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   A substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be used to make interest and principal payments, limiting the funds available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, and other corporate purposes, including future acquisitions that could benefit our business.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Our ability to secure additional financing in the future may be hindered.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   We may be more highly leveraged than our competitors, placing us at a competitive disadvantage.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Our flexibility in responding to changes in our business and industry may be constrained.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   Our level of leverage may make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business, industry, or the broader economy.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements may limit our ability to secure future financing, make necessary capital expenditures, withstand a downturn in our business or the economy, or conduct essential corporate activities. These covenants could prevent us from capitalizing on emerging business opportunities.\nA breach of any of these covenants would constitute a default under the relevant debt agreement. If not waived, this could trigger immediate repayment obligations under that agreement and potentially accelerate repayment requirements under other agreements. If this occurs, the debt would become immediately due and payable. We may not have the funds to pay all such debt or to obtain sufficient financing to refinance it. Even if financing is available, the terms may not be favorable.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, we had $164.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. Approximately 83% of our consolidated cash balance is held outside the U.S. Repatriating funds to meet U.S. cash needs could be subject to legal restrictions, tax liabilities, or contractual limitations. Additionally, as we use cash for acquisitions and other purposes, these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future prospects.\nWe assumed an underfunded pension liability as part of the fiscal 2010 acquisition of Delta Ltd., which may require increased funding and impose restrictions on excess cash usage.\nDelta Ltd. sponsors a U.K. defined benefit pension plan (the “Plan”), which, as of December 28, 2024, covered approximately 5,150 former employees, either inactive or retired. The Plan has no active employee members. As of December 28, 2024, the Plan was overfunded by approximately £37.0 million ($46.5 million) for accounting purposes. Under the current agreement with the Plan trustees, we are obligated to provide annual funding of approximately £13.1 million ($16.7 million) to address the funding shortfall at the time of acquisition, along with an additional approximately £1.9 million ($2.5 million) for administrative expenses. Although this funding obligation was factored into the acquisition price of Delta, the Plan’s funding status may still have adverse effects on the combined company, including:\n\n●   U.K. laws and regulations typically require the Plan trustees to agree on a new funding plan every three years, with the most recent plan established in fiscal 2022. Changes in actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, inflation, interest rates, investment returns, and mortality projections, could increase the Plan’s underfunded position, requiring higher contributions to cover liabilities.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●   The U.K. government regulates the Plan, and its trustees represent the interests of covered workers. Under certain circumstances, regulations could trigger an immediate funding obligation significantly greater than the asset recognized for accounting purposes as of December 28, 2024. This obligation, calculated based on the cost of purchasing annuities to cover liabilities, could impact our ability to finance business growth or meet other financial commitments.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGeneral Risks\nOur businesses rely on skilled labor and management talent, and we may face challenges in attracting and retaining qualified employees.\nSkilled factory workers and management are essential to meeting customer needs, driving sales growth, and maintaining competitive advantages. In some regions, shortages of workers with specific skills, such as welding, equipment maintenance, and operating complex machinery, have increased labor costs. Equally important is management talent, which is crucial for business growth and effective succession planning as key employees retire. In certain regions, it may be difficult to find skilled management for specific roles. If we struggle to attract and retain these critical skills, it could negatively impact our ability to grow profitably in the future.\nWe face strong competition in the markets we serve.\nWe experience competitive pressures from various companies across all our markets. Our competitors include both companies offering similar technologies and those providing alternative solutions, such as drip irrigation. These competitors range from international and national manufacturers to local ones, some of which may have greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, and technical resources, or deeper penetration and familiarity with specific geographic markets.\nAdditionally, certain competitors, particularly in our Utility and Telecommunications product lines, have sought bankruptcy protection in recent years. If they emerge with reduced debt obligations, they may be able to operate at lower prices, putting pressure on our margins. Some customers have also shifted manufacturing or sourcing operations overseas, negatively impacting our sales of galvanizing services.\nTo remain competitive, we must invest in manufacturing, product development, and customer service. At times, we may need to adjust pricing, particularly for customers in struggling industries. However, we cannot guarantee our competitive position in all markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may not achieve the improved operating results we anticipate from future acquisitions, and we may face difficulties integrating the acquired businesses or inherit significant liabilities associated with them.\nWe regularly explore opportunities to acquire businesses that align with our core competencies, some of which may be material to us. We expect these acquisitions to result in better operating performance than we would otherwise achieve. However, we cannot guarantee that this expectation will be realized for any given acquisition.\nFuture acquisitions may present significant challenges for our management, requiring considerable time and resources to integrate key aspects of the acquired business, such as management, employees, information systems, accounting controls, personnel, and administrative functions, into Valmont. We may struggle to fully integrate and streamline overlapping functions, and even if we do succeed, the process may be more costly than initially anticipated. Additionally, integrating our product offerings with those of acquired businesses may prove difficult, and we may not be able to improve our collective product offering as expected.\nOur integration efforts could be affected by factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions. Moreover, the integration process may disrupt or slow down the activities of our existing business. The diversion of management’s attention, along with any delays or challenges encountered during integration, could negatively impact our operations, results, and liquidity. In some cases, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may never materialize.\nFurthermore, although we conduct due diligence reviews of potential acquisitions, we may still be exposed to unexpected claims or liabilities, including environmental cleanup costs. These liabilities could be costly to defend or resolve and may be substantial, potentially having a material adverse effect on our business, results, and liquidity.\nWe may incur significant warranty or contract management costs.\nIn our Infrastructure segment, we manufacture large electrical transmission structures, which are often highly engineered for large, complex contracts. These contracts may include terms that penalize us for late delivery, leading to consequential and compensatory damages. Occasionally, product quality issues may arise on large utility structure orders, resulting in significant costs. Additionally, our Infrastructure segment includes structures for a variety of applications such as outdoor lighting, traffic, and wireless communication.\nOur Agriculture products are covered by warranty provisions, some of which extend over several years. If widespread product reliability issues occur with certain components, we may face substantial costs to address the situation.\nOur operations could be adversely affected if our information technology systems and networks are compromised or subjected to cyberattacks.\nCyberattacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and pose significant risks to the security of our information technology systems and networks. If these systems are breached, it could severely affect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. As our operations involve transferring data across international borders, we must comply with complex and stringent standards to protect both business and personal data, including in the U.S. and European Union countries.\nOur risk management strategy focuses on maintaining and protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information for both our business and customers. We rely on an information security program that includes a wide range of cybersecurity measures. More details about these measures can be found in Part I, Item 1C of this report. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect, respond to, and mitigate unauthorized activity, there is no guarantee they will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the risks of a cyberattack—whether directly targeting our systems or through third-party service providers—or to enable us to detect, report, or respond in a timely and effective manner.\nSuccessful cyberattacks or other security incidents could result in the loss of key innovations, such as artificial intelligence or Internet of Things technologies; loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, or destructive attacks; and business delays or service disruptions. These incidents could lead to legal risks, fines, penalties, negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information, defective products, production downtimes, and operational disruptions. All of these could harm our reputation and competitiveness, and materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulatory and business developments regarding climate change could adversely impact our operations and demand for our products.\nRegulatory and business developments related to climate change could adversely affect our operations and the demand for our products. We closely monitor scientific discussions and legislative developments regarding climate change, including proposed regulations, to assess their potential impact on our business. \nOngoing debates about the presence and scope of climate change, along with increasing legislative and regulatory attention, are expected to continue. Our production processes and the market for our products are influenced by such laws and regulations. Compliance with these measures may result in higher costs for raw materials and transportation. Non-compliance could damage our reputation and further expose our operations and customers to significant risks.\nClimate change also presents physical risks, such as the increased frequency of severe weather events and rising sea levels, which could disrupt operations at our manufacturing facilities. These events may cause unforeseen disruptions of systems, equipment, or overall operations.\nAdditionally, we are facing rising insurance premiums and costs, including for property, casualty, and business interruption insurance. This trend is partly driven by the growing frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other natural disasters. Insurers have responded by tightening underwriting standards, reducing coverage limits, and increasing premium rates, particularly for businesses with geographically diverse and asset-intensive operations like ours. Any reduction in insurance coverage limits or the introduction of policy exclusions increases our financial exposure to losses associated with casualty events, including extreme weather occurrences.\nWe may encounter challenges in quickly adjusting our manufacturing capacity to respond to sudden shifts in demand for Infrastructure products.\nProducing large engineered structures for Infrastructure customers requires significant machinery and often necessitates operating our facilities at or near full capacity to achieve optimal utilization. As a result, if demand for specific structure types in the Utility market changes unexpectedly, our ability to adjust manufacturing capacity in the near term may be limited.\nEstablishing new manufacturing capacity or expanding existing capacity involves significant vendor lead times, capital investments, and customer approvals, all of which further delay our ability to respond to unexpected increases in demand. These limitations could lead to delays in order fulfillment, customer dissatisfaction, potential business loss, inventory imbalances, increased labor and material costs, reduced productivity, lower profit margins, reputational harm, and a weakened market position. If we are unable to effectively address these challenges, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.",
